[00:00] Welcome everybody. We are here at
[00:01] Bitcoin 2025. I am Frank Corva, the
[00:04] political correspondent for Bitcoin
[00:05] Magazine, joined by none other than
[00:07] Senator Bill Hagerty of Tennessee.
[00:10] Senator Hagerty, thank you so much for
[00:11] taking the time to do this. You today
[00:13] and the the energy here is absolutely
[00:15] phenomenal. If you think about the
[00:16] momentum that we've created since the
[00:18] November elections, it's amazing. I
[00:20] appreciate that. And I also appreciate
[00:21] the energy you're bringing to it talking
[00:23] about uh you know crypto assets versus
[00:26] CBDC's making this distinction very
[00:29] clear for people not only here at the
[00:30] conference but I think it was on CNBC
[00:32] earlier this week as well. I'm curious
[00:34] to hear what has this learning process
[00:35] been like for you? What has it been like
[00:37] to sort of learn about this difference
[00:38] and to learn about why it's important
[00:40] for America to lead when it comes to
[00:41] something like Bitcoin? Well, I'm from
[00:43] Tennessee. It doesn't take much learning
[00:44] to appreciate liberty and freedom, which
[00:46] is exactly what we're talking about
[00:48] here, as compared to a central bank
[00:51] digital currency, which is precisely
[00:52] what the Chinese Communist Party have
[00:54] delivered and is precisely what some of
[00:56] the members of the US Senate would like
[00:59] to see in place. That's why we've had
[01:00] such massive resistance to a
[01:02] decentralized solution like the one
[01:04] we're putting forward. But I'm very
[01:06] optimistic that we're going to get our
[01:07] stable coin legislation through the
[01:08] Senate very, very soon, as in the next
[01:11] several days, week. Uh what it's going
[01:14] to do is actually perpetuate dollar
[01:15] dominance in the world. It's going to
[01:17] take us into a payment system that's in
[01:19] the 21st century. You think about what
[01:21] we're using right now developed in the
[01:23] 70s and the 80s. Takes 5 to 10 days to
[01:25] clear a transaction. We're going to move
[01:27] into an instant close to instantaneous
[01:30] environment. Again, moving the dollar
[01:32] forward as the reserve currency of
[01:34] choice, creating more demand for US
[01:36] treasuries, taking cost and
[01:38] inefficiencies out of the system,
[01:39] reducing risk. If you think about
[01:41] counterparty risk, you think about
[01:42] currency risk, those both go to almost
[01:45] nothing when you have an instantaneous
[01:47] transaction. And if you think about the
[01:49] working capital that's tied up in the
[01:51] system right now that could be put to
[01:52] more productive use. All of this is good
[01:54] for America. It's good for our economy
[01:56] and frankly, it's going to be great for
[01:58] us on a global basis. Incredible. Thank
[02:00] you. Um, one of the things we talked
[02:01] about last year on the live desk, I was
[02:02] lucky enough to be joined by yourself
[02:04] and Senator Blackburn. We talked a lot
[02:05] about energy in Bitcoin and how
[02:07] Tennessee is shaping up to really be a
[02:09] hub for Bitcoin mining and to be
[02:10] something that maybe is a catalyst for
[02:12] more nuclear energy development. Is this
[02:14] still on the table? It it absolutely is.
[02:16] We we have the opportunity before us.
[02:19] Tennessee does to be in the very lead of
[02:21] all of this. The largest utility in the
[02:23] world is the Tennessee Valley Authority.
[02:25] Certainly the largest one in in America.
[02:27] And I think we've got a unique
[02:29] opportunity here to move forward and
[02:31] become the energy hub of America to see
[02:34] more and more not only mining operations
[02:37] but if you think about what Elon Musk is
[02:39] doing in Memphis with XAI uh the data
[02:42] centers the opportunities with
[02:44] artificial intelligence there are many
[02:46] many things that are going to happen in
[02:47] Tennessee and we've got Oakidge National
[02:49] Lab in the east part of our state a
[02:51] great hub of innovation there too. So, I
[02:53] think the partnerships that we can
[02:54] strike with Oakidge National Labs,
[02:56] Vandil University, University of
[02:57] Tennessee, you know, Tennessee Tech,
[03:00] we've got great opportunities. Memphis,
[03:03] uh, all the way across the state, we
[03:04] have huge opportunity from a advanced
[03:07] technology standpoint to really see
[03:08] Tennessee thrive in the nation as well.
[03:11] Appreciate that perspective. Another
[03:12] thing, last question. Um, you talk a lot
[03:14] about opportunity, right? You just
[03:15] mentioned it, you've used this word a
[03:16] bunch of times. Are other people both on
[03:18] the right and on the left at the federal
[03:20] level are other politicians also seeing
[03:22] Bitcoin the larger ecosystem the crypto
[03:24] ecosystem as an opportunity not just
[03:26] saying like okay well voters care about
[03:28] this so let's pander to them but really
[03:30] seeing the enormity of the opportunity
[03:31] that's presented you rais a great point
[03:33] and I think the answer is absolutely yes
[03:36] uh and it's a it's a bipartisan issue or
[03:38] it's a nonpartisan issue frankly if you
[03:40] care about the competitiveness of
[03:41] America if you want to see innovation
[03:42] happen on our shores rather than being
[03:44] pushed overseas then you're going to
[03:46] support what we're trying to do in terms
[03:47] of putting a regulatory framework in
[03:49] place that will deliver certainty, that
[03:51] will create an ecosystem here in America
[03:53] that will allow these companies to
[03:54] thrive. And it's not just the stable
[03:56] coin legislation I'm putting forward or
[03:58] what may happen with Bitcoin or other
[04:00] technologies like that. It's the overall
[04:02] blockchain technology that's going to
[04:04] help advance America beyond the 21st
[04:06] century. We need to stay in the lead. We
[04:08] can stay in the lead. This is a
[04:09] fundamental step forward in that
[04:11] direction. Perfectly said. Well, thank
[04:13] you so much for your work, Senator
[04:14] Hagerty, and thank you for your time
[04:15] this evening. You enjoy the event.
