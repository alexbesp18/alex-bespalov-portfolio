[00:00] So we had Vance today speak the VP of
[00:05] the USA and he called Bitcoin a
[00:10] strategic asset like the world is
[00:12] listening that is the state of mining
[00:14] now where sovereigns and vice presidents
[00:17] are talking about Bitcoin. So a question
[00:20] to you and you you can do a quick intro
[00:22] to it right before you speak is what are
[00:26] the strategic reasons for nation states
[00:29] mining or for attracting hash rate to
[00:33] their country?
[00:35] Nice. Hi. Um, so like I think where we
[00:39] can start off is
[00:41] we all know that Bitcoin is like really
[00:45] really scarce and it's going to manifest
[00:50] even more so with big players coming
[00:53] into space and purchasing and acquiring
[00:57] trying to build reserves.
[00:59] uh the scarcer it's going to get, the
[01:03] more important hash rate will become. Uh
[01:07] because obviously it's going to be one
[01:10] of the ways to acquire Bitcoin in larger
[01:14] quantities. uh strategy owns about what
[01:19] was it 580,000
[01:21] almost like 600 like you know it's and
[01:25] there's approximately 1 million left to
[01:27] be mined in the next 100 years
[01:30] to give a little bit of perspective on
[01:32] that. So mining and hash rate are you
[01:36] know going to be the thing that
[01:41] we'll be talking about in the next
[01:42] couple of years I think.
[01:46] So um bitcoin uh is something that uh
[01:49] can define the sovereignity of a country
[01:52] for sure and uh there are some scarce
[01:56] resources in this kind of um ambient
[01:59] because if we are considering block
[02:01] space for example it's something uh that
[02:05] uh is strategically important for for
[02:07] estate uh because it's limited um there
[02:10] is a kind of limited amount of
[02:13] transaction in every block and there is
[02:15] a limited amount of blocks. We have 144
[02:18] blocks a day. And so it's important for
[02:21] a nation state to try to be uh
[02:24] strategically
[02:26] one of the first that can handle this
[02:29] part um in order to have the power to
[02:33] handle some kind of transactions and not
[02:36] stay apart uh from from this kind of
[02:39] business. And so there is a limitation
[02:42] for sure on block space and uh similar
[02:45] um can be for the ash rate. Uh because
[02:48] also mining is something really
[02:50] important in order to have the control
[02:53] then on bitcoin and all all this kind of
[02:56] industry. Um and so um we are seeing
[03:00] national states that are making
[03:02] important investments um in this kind of
[03:05] sector and are making Bitcoin reserves
[03:08] um in order to try to handle this um
[03:11] these kind of aspects that are limited.
[03:15] Uh so I I think we skipped over intro so
[03:17] I'll plug myself real quick and I think
[03:18] we we should all do a round of intros
[03:20] too. So I'm Kevin Zayn. I'm a SVP at
[03:23] Foundry Digital. Uh we're a wholly owned
[03:25] subsidiary of digital currency group and
[03:28] uh we're best known for our software and
[03:30] our services we provide in the mining uh
[03:32] space. Uh in particular our mining pool.
[03:34] Uh we're one of the largest mining pools
[03:36] in the world. Uh but a lot of people
[03:37] also don't know that we offer uh minor
[03:39] management software firmware and uh site
[03:43] operations where we'll actually go in
[03:44] help you outsource uh people to manage
[03:47] your operations on site as well. um to
[03:49] but to answer the question like what
[03:51] attracts nations into uh Bitcoin mining
[03:54] and even their interest in block space I
[03:56] think first they have to obviously know
[03:58] what they're getting themselves into
[04:00] right um the space moves incredibly
[04:02] quickly the narratives change very fast
[04:04] but the one thing they need to have
[04:06] established before miners feel
[04:07] comfortable coming in is rule of law
[04:10] right because when you have established
[04:12] frameworks and nowadays it's no longer
[04:14] like small individual miners that going
[04:16] to these various countries new locations
[04:18] new regions
[04:19] These are large public companies,
[04:21] sovereign wealth funds, and they're
[04:23] deploying hundreds of million if not
[04:25] billions of dollars. And these uh these
[04:27] projects, they take years to build up
[04:29] and get started. So, you don't want
[04:31] something to shift on you halfway
[04:33] through your project, halfway through
[04:34] your um your plans, right? Uh not only
[04:37] do you have to figure out the right
[04:38] vendors to work with, but even your
[04:40] designs or your tax liabilities, right?
[04:43] Whether it's VAT or how much you're
[04:45] going to pay uh for your electricity,
[04:47] etc. All this has to be kind of locked
[04:49] down and without rule of law and without
[04:51] kind of established frameworks, it's
[04:54] very difficult for uh nation states to
[04:56] get started uh mining locally.
[05:00] Sorry, did you want to do a really quick
[05:01] intro? Yeah, I'm Francesca Feloni uh CFO
[05:05] and co-founder of Alps Blockchain. Uh we
[05:07] are a mining company. Uh we have we have
[05:10] operations around the world from South
[05:12] America to Middle East to North America.
[05:15] uh in particular we have um Oman as a
[05:18] country and then Paraguay, Ecuador, US
[05:20] and Europe where we started uh we will
[05:24] reach uh 15 exile by December and so we
[05:27] are growing a lot and our vision is to
[05:30] try to connect the world of energy and
[05:33] energy transition with the mining
[05:35] activity.
[05:37] Um for those of you who don't know me,
[05:40] I'm Philip. I'm uh
[05:43] the chief legal officer at Nice Hash.
[05:45] Nice hash is a platform
[05:48] uh providing a live hash rate
[05:51] marketplace. Um
[05:55] it behaves a lot like a pool but with a
[05:58] lot of add-ons. So um check us out.
[06:03] Can you guys talk about the connection?
[06:06] Introduce yourself. Oh, sorry. Yes.
[06:08] Hello. I'm Mags. I'm with PDRTI. We take
[06:11] waste tires and we mine Bitcoin. I'm
[06:13] also part of Vibes Capital Management.
[06:15] You may have seen us on Twitter,
[06:18] but I'm also actually I'm writing a book
[06:20] on like nation state gate game theory
[06:24] and geopolitics of Bitcoin mining. So,
[06:25] this is like a cool panel and I'm
[06:27] privileged to be on this panel with you
[06:29] guys because I get the lowdown like so,
[06:32] okay,
[06:33] I'm a nation state. I'm gonna buy a
[06:35] Bitcoin reserve. Does it matter if I
[06:38] have a reserve? But I don't have hash
[06:40] rate and I don't have block space
[06:42] access. I don't think so. I think you
[06:44] need those. But why don't you guys offer
[06:47] your thoughts? Yeah, it's really
[06:49] important to have it for sure. uh
[06:51] because to handle also the block space,
[06:54] you need to have some kind of computing
[06:56] power. And so uh the mining activity is
[07:00] kind of the base of this kind of um
[07:02] blockchain technology. And so uh trying
[07:06] to work also on the mining uh sector is
[07:09] really important for nation states uh
[07:11] because it helps handle the block space.
[07:14] it helps handle uh like the transaction
[07:18] um and so um you can decide uh how is
[07:22] what is going to be approved on the
[07:24] blockchain or not. Um it's uh really
[07:28] important for monetary sovereignity
[07:31] uh because uh again um mining is the key
[07:35] uh of this kind of sector and so um it
[07:38] it's a really strategic result and in
[07:42] addition to that there is also the
[07:45] electricity and so um part that is
[07:48] really important because uh we have a
[07:50] lot of examples of how mining can
[07:53] benefit the energy transition and how it
[07:55] can be strategic also for that part and
[07:58] so uh also to for the development of a
[08:01] country for that point of view it's
[08:03] really important
[08:06] I think
[08:07] from a perspective of management of
[08:10] natural resources it's also really
[08:13] important for nation states to
[08:14] understand what mining actually does and
[08:18] how it what it can do so you have
[08:22] natural resources being used up for
[08:26] powering Bitcoin mining.
[08:29] It's it's an activity that's that makes
[08:32] it really easy to take that wealth and
[08:34] project it thousands kilometers away to
[08:37] an foreign entity.
[08:39] I think it's going to go down that this
[08:42] road that governments and states will
[08:46] realize uh that this is something they
[08:49] need to keep in mind and address in
[08:51] certain ways. Uh I think we will see a
[08:54] lot of legislation in the near future uh
[08:58] coming down on this particular topic. Uh
[09:04] it's been in the shades for long but I
[09:08] think with all this allocation of
[09:11] resources into this directions
[09:15] it we will see a lot of protectionism.
[09:18] Um I'm certain of it. That's actually a
[09:21] really good take. I think it's really
[09:23] interesting if you look at the country
[09:25] of Bhutan, right? Only 800,000 people,
[09:28] but they have a lot of excess power.
[09:32] They don't have gold. They don't have
[09:34] precious metals, but they are mining a
[09:37] scarce digital resource and building up
[09:40] a treasury. And they actually have been
[09:41] spending it. They've spent maybe 400 500
[09:45] million over the last couple of months.
[09:46] And they're building an airport and a
[09:48] city. So like Bitcoin mining is building
[09:51] that country up and they by my estimate
[09:54] 1.5 to 2% of hash rate will be in Bhutan
[09:58] in the next uh couple of months. So like
[10:02] that's pretty significant. US has
[10:04] massive hash rate. Do you think there's
[10:06] a certain uh percentage hash rate that
[10:08] countries should aspire to?
[10:12] Uh well going back to the previous
[10:13] question of uh nation states getting
[10:14] into whether they should have a reserve
[10:17] or start mining. I think it's really
[10:18] important for each of these different
[10:20] countries to kind of play the hand that
[10:21] they're dealt, right? We talked about
[10:23] whether you have abundance of
[10:24] electricity or you have a grid
[10:26] framework, tax laws, etc. Like one of
[10:28] the reasons why MetaPlanet really took
[10:30] off in Japan, most people don't know
[10:32] there's a 55% unrealized capital gains
[10:35] on Bitcoin that you hold, right? And
[10:37] that also applies to a lot of
[10:38] businesses. So, it makes sense to have a
[10:40] proxy where um you don't have the same
[10:42] tax laws if it's uh investing in a
[10:44] Bitcoin company or in a company itself,
[10:46] right? Um, Japan doesn't have a lot of
[10:48] electricity, so they probably won't get
[10:50] into the Bitcoin mining game. Uh, now to
[10:53] your question that you're asking about
[10:55] uh, Bhutan uh, and what percentage of
[10:57] hash rate makes sense. I think it's once
[10:59] again how much power and how much
[11:00] resources do you have, right? Um, it
[11:02] probably doesn't make sense to build
[11:04] power just for Bitcoin mining. But if
[11:06] you have abundance, an overabundance,
[11:08] you have cheap electricity that's
[11:09] dormant or isn't being utilized or you
[11:11] have uh, a grid that you need to
[11:13] balance, Bitcoin mining is great for
[11:15] that, right? Uh, I think this is what a
[11:16] lot of a lot of the things that you were
[11:18] doing at PR PRTI, which is um off-grid
[11:20] mining, but also helping balance grids
[11:22] for newly developed energy
[11:24] infrastructure. Bitcoin mining is this
[11:26] controllable load that you can shut off
[11:28] within seconds, right? And that is a
[11:31] very powerful tool for when you're
[11:32] developing uh new energy infrastructure,
[11:34] especially renewables. So I think it's
[11:37] as much as it's like uh these companies
[11:39] are leveraging Bitcoin to help their
[11:41] financial prospects, it also helps them
[11:43] uh establish stability for other
[11:45] infrastructure they're building like the
[11:46] bit uh the airport that Bhutan funded
[11:48] with uh their Bitcoin and gains. But
[11:50] also I think energy and power is so
[11:52] related with uh kind of standard of
[11:55] living and how well country is doing uh
[11:57] how well they're able to industrialize
[11:59] and Bitcoin mining can help lead that
[12:01] charge. And I I've visited um Kenya
[12:05] where gridless set up and they are
[12:07] building out power in communities that
[12:09] never had power before. subsaharan
[12:11] Africa there's some places where 80% of
[12:13] people are disconnected from power and
[12:15] that is where I think like from you know
[12:18] nation state it's being built from the
[12:19] ground up but they're actually bringing
[12:21] that country out of poverty like to the
[12:24] energy line and then at the complete
[12:26] opposite side you look at the US and
[12:29] other nations that are building out AI
[12:31] infrastructure and that the amount of
[12:33] power that is predicted to grow I think
[12:36] AI is supposed to hit about 10% of all
[12:39] power demand in North America in 2030.
[12:43] Um, so I'd like to advance today talked
[12:45] about the importance of connecting
[12:48] Bitcoin and AI. So I'd like you guys to
[12:51] talk a little bit about that because you
[12:53] know a lot of folks are thinking AI is
[12:54] sort of where you know we'll we'll build
[12:57] up sort of the next generation
[12:58] productivity within countries. So what's
[13:01] the connection that you guys see between
[13:03] AI and you know national sovereignty and
[13:06] energy security?
[13:09] Well, I first off I I think there's when
[13:12] we talk about AI today, it's like you
[13:16] know it can be a lot of things. Uh on
[13:19] the Bitcoin side coming from a let's say
[13:22] compliance connected background uh I
[13:25] think we will see a lot of application
[13:26] in transaction monitoring preventing uh
[13:29] so enforcing anti-moneyaundering rules.
[13:32] So this is a field where for sure AI
[13:36] will have its firm place. I know for a
[13:39] fact that there is companies already out
[13:41] there using AI in order to you know
[13:46] facilitate or make it easier to monitor
[13:49] machines to um
[13:53] keep a hand on your in hardware and
[13:55] infrastructure. So for now
[14:01] it's going to involve
[14:04] what I think is that the connection
[14:07] between these two technologies is for
[14:09] sure the infrastructure because uh
[14:12] energy is the key for both uh AI and
[14:15] mining. Um they are a completely
[14:18] different kind of business model and
[14:20] activity. Um and if we see the capex per
[14:23] megawatt of mining is like really uh
[14:27] lower than the the AI ones. So what can
[14:31] be the synergy um is that um you can you
[14:35] can have really good energy contracts
[14:38] because of scale production uh thanks to
[14:40] Bitcoin mining and use this kind of
[14:43] energy contract to have really um
[14:46] efficient operation uh for AI. And this
[14:50] means that together uh there are many
[14:53] companies that are building electrical
[14:55] infrastructure. uh and this electrical
[14:57] infrastructure is not only like the low
[15:00] voltage part, it's also the substation
[15:03] and the high voltage part that core us
[15:06] is not such an important part. But if we
[15:09] think about other kind of countries,
[15:12] it's something that can be then
[15:14] beneficial for all the country
[15:15] development of like the grid and the
[15:18] infrastructure because uh we as a
[15:21] company but many other listed miners are
[15:24] working on this kind of activity. Um and
[15:28] um we see example of mining um that is
[15:31] really beneficial for the electrical
[15:33] infrastructure of like less advanced
[15:37] countries. Um AI is something uh really
[15:41] interested interesting for like bigger
[15:44] companies. Um and because like
[15:47] competition is really important. Um
[15:50] while mining can be uh a really good uh
[15:54] strategical um start in order to work on
[15:57] the uh energy PPA for sure. And um this
[16:01] is also a connection between like
[16:04] private corporations and then national
[16:06] states because we can see how private
[16:09] activities you said the example of
[16:11] Bhutan but there is Kenya we are doing
[16:15] the same in Oman when we are we are
[16:17] using like natural gas power plant to
[16:20] then build uh renewable energy sources
[16:23] and so we can see how private
[16:25] corporation can benefit also the
[16:27] development and energy transition of
[16:29] national states.
[16:31] So I'll just build off Francesca's point
[16:33] which is the intersection of AI and
[16:35] Bitcoin mining definitely is on the
[16:37] power consumption and electricity right
[16:40] uh but the usage is very different uh AI
[16:42] not only is it more capex uh intensive
[16:44] and more dense uh the uptime required
[16:47] for AI is often 99.9% of the time they
[16:50] don't have the luxury of being able to
[16:52] shut down being able to turn off they
[16:54] have fixed contracts and they have to
[16:55] remain online at all times so let's take
[16:57] Texas for example that's a very popular
[16:59] destination for a lot of data centers, a
[17:01] lot of Bitcoin miners. So, what they've
[17:02] done down there to enjoy lower
[17:05] electrical rates for their overall
[17:06] deployment is they blend both HPC and AI
[17:09] and Bitcoin mining. Uh what that allows
[17:11] for them to do is they have anywhere
[17:13] from 5 to 10% of their facility
[17:15] dedicated for AI where they will never
[17:17] turn that off. But for the remaining
[17:18] 90%, they're able to participate in
[17:21] demand response and curtailment. And
[17:22] that allows them to significantly lower
[17:25] their average electrical rate uh over
[17:27] the course of the year because of that
[17:28] flexibility. And I think that is really
[17:31] wonderful synergy that a lot of
[17:32] companies are starting to explore now.
[17:34] And the other thing that's really
[17:35] interesting is so especially in the US
[17:37] where they built out these large giga
[17:39] mines and they're converting some of
[17:40] that infrastructure now to AI. In a way
[17:43] it's kind of accelerated AI because that
[17:45] infrastructure was already built out
[17:47] ready for compute but now it's being
[17:49] switched to AI. And then you look at
[17:50] places like Europe, right, where
[17:54] historically they've made certain policy
[17:56] decisions around energy. They turned off
[17:58] the nukes and power is really expensive
[18:00] and in a way they're behind because
[18:03] mining did not set up in the same way
[18:05] that it did in the United States, in
[18:07] Canada. And so in a way they've almost
[18:10] shot themselves in the foot in my
[18:12] opinion.
[18:14] Um well you hit my nerve here because
[18:18] I'm from Europe and um
[18:22] uh not only in this sense so Europe has
[18:27] had a lot of missteps with the maker
[18:30] regulation. Yeah, uh European take on AI
[18:35] in general is fundamentally wrong. I
[18:38] guess like
[18:41] it's an environment that makes it
[18:44] virtually impossible for startups in
[18:47] this in both fields. Yeah. Uh to come up
[18:52] with new solution and to drive uh
[18:55] advancement. So
[18:58] for now I would say forgot about Europe.
[19:00] Um
[19:04] there are there are things like I think
[19:06] uh you proved it that it still can be
[19:09] done even in Europe uh with a lot of
[19:13] knowledge with a lot of um let's say
[19:17] out of the box thinking um but yeah it's
[19:20] uh I would say the US right now with
[19:24] this administration
[19:26] is proving what a good policy maker can
[19:30] provide. to the to the whole industry.
[19:36] So when we started our mining activity,
[19:39] uh we wanted to try to find a way to do
[19:42] it in Italy and we have the example of
[19:46] Italy being one of the most expensive
[19:48] countries for mining in the world
[19:51] because of the power rate that is really
[19:53] high. Um we found out a way uh that is
[19:57] connecting directly with the hydro power
[19:59] plants but this is not applicable for AI
[20:03] because of like uh what Kevin said the
[20:05] uptime so mining can be flexible both
[20:09] for the up time and internet connection
[20:12] and so we have uh mining data center
[20:14] like on the mountains with starlink uh
[20:18] that's impossible for AI so what we are
[20:21] seeing is that uh there are some
[20:23] development ments of AI in Europe. Uh
[20:27] many are in France because it's a
[20:29] country that is producing a lot of
[20:31] nuclear energy and so the average power
[20:34] costs is lower than in other um
[20:36] countries in in Europe. Um and also we
[20:40] have to consider that for the AI the
[20:43] electricity consumption is lower than
[20:45] mining. So there are some kind of um AI
[20:49] activities and AI data center that are
[20:52] getting built uh because it's not so
[20:54] fundamental to have a good power rate.
[20:57] It's important to have a kind of
[20:59] efficient sites and for many European
[21:03] country they prefer to pay may uh like
[21:06] um the computing power a little bit more
[21:09] but have it in Europe instead of having
[21:12] it in US for AI. So there are some kind
[21:15] of developments for sure regulation is
[21:18] is not helping as always unfortunately
[21:21] in Europe because it takes me like uh
[21:24] much more time than in other countries
[21:27] and it's not so open uh mostly uh but
[21:30] also we have example in northern Europe
[21:34] uh like Sweden uh Finland where there
[21:37] are some kind of mining activities with
[21:40] like circular economic projects so that
[21:43] like mining itself maybe is not so
[21:45] profitable there but then there are some
[21:48] projects of reuse of the hatch or like
[21:51] other applications that can make also
[21:53] the mining activity work but as always
[21:57] doing things in Europe is like more
[21:59] difficult than in other countries
[22:01] because you need to be creative in
[22:03] finding other ways
[22:06] yeah so I I think we keep hammering the
[22:08] same point which is energy consumption
[22:09] power electrical availability right
[22:11] there's a direct correlation if
[22:13] causation between standard of living,
[22:15] advancement, innovation, and the amount
[22:17] of electricity you can produce in a
[22:18] nation. And there's a reason why
[22:20] historically there have been several uh
[22:22] countries that really dominated Bitcoin
[22:24] mining. Uh the US, more recently, Russia
[22:27] and historically China. Um and even
[22:29] today about 40% of all mining happens
[22:31] within North America, about 30% anywhere
[22:34] from 20 30% is in Russia. Uh and about
[22:36] 10% still in China, and the rest is kind
[22:39] of scattered across the world. But if
[22:41] you look at all these large mining
[22:43] facilities, the one similarity in
[22:45] property they have and jurisdictions
[22:46] they're in is that these countries all
[22:48] had substantial massive electrical
[22:51] infrastructure. Uh for the US, we used
[22:53] to be a manufacturing powerhouse, right?
[22:55] So a lot of the aluminum smelters,
[22:57] lumber mills, uh paper factories, etc.
[23:00] these have a lot of them have been
[23:01] retrofitted for Bitcoin mining. These
[23:03] are a lot of the brownfield sites you
[23:04] see today that have large mining
[23:06] imprints. Uh with China, obviously
[23:08] they're manufacturing a lot. out they're
[23:09] going really heavy renewables. Um that's
[23:12] a lot of abundance electricity with
[23:13] Russia. That's the former USSR days,
[23:15] right? There was a lot of capacity that
[23:17] was been dormant for a long time and
[23:19] that's being utilized um for Bitcoin
[23:22] mining and other other purposes as well.
[23:24] The thing is it's really easy to turn
[23:26] off power like they've done in Europe.
[23:27] They really shot themselves in the foot,
[23:29] but it's very very difficult to build
[23:30] this power infrastructure that takes uh
[23:33] years if not decades. So we're going to
[23:35] change tax a little bit to the forward
[23:37] future looking. So for those nation
[23:40] states or sovereign wealth funds that
[23:42] are interested to get getting into
[23:44] mining, where do you sort of see it
[23:47] going? Whether it's um if you think
[23:50] about uh pools, for example, El Salvador
[23:52] has its own pool. Are we thinking
[23:54] they're going to be launching pools? Are
[23:56] they going to be launching alliances
[23:58] like the World Trade Organization? Are
[24:00] they going to create their own kind of
[24:02] alliance so that they have access to
[24:04] block space? Do you think they'll be
[24:05] buying hash rate instead of building
[24:07] hash rate? Where do you guys think it's
[24:09] going for the nation state level? I
[24:12] think one thing is that um as I said it
[24:17] before it's I think what's coming is a
[24:21] big interest in managing and controlling
[24:25] hash rate uh that is being produced with
[24:28] resources uh in your territory.
[24:32] uh local or state pools or at least
[24:37] relays where this hash rate will
[24:41] flow through if nothing else
[24:45] is kind of my gut feeling. Um not that
[24:52] I'm a big fan of it, but I think this is
[24:54] how it's going to go down. The other
[24:57] thing is how to get Bitcoin. So
[25:01] partially definitely through taking part
[25:04] of these process
[25:07] uh partially acquisition of hash rate I
[25:10] think is going to be a big big thing.
[25:13] I'm a fan of it because we have a
[25:15] marketplace for hash rate. So you know
[25:18] uh but in general as I said I think this
[25:23] is going to be a big big big topic in
[25:25] the coming years. Okay.
[25:28] uh I think it must be a kind of mix of
[25:31] all these uh aspects because only having
[25:35] the control on a measure pool uh means
[25:38] that any way a minor can decide uh
[25:41] whether to give the ash rate to your
[25:43] pool or not. So you don't have the
[25:46] control on ash rate at the end. um
[25:49] building infrastructure is maybe the
[25:51] safest way but uh it's kind of limited
[25:56] on scale on like the available
[25:58] electricity uh in the country. It takes
[26:01] time. It takes a lot of investments
[26:04] um a specific knowow. So maybe nation
[26:08] states can work on having their mining
[26:11] farm. That's important. But I don't feel
[26:14] that there will be like really big scale
[26:17] operations. Um
[26:20] so it can be like a kind of mix of
[26:23] having control on a pool um having
[26:26] control on some ash rate and then having
[26:28] some mining farms. so that they can kind
[26:31] of balance uh the power um and have a
[26:35] strategic kind of view on every aspect
[26:38] of the mining activity. Yeah. Yeah. So,
[26:41] I think the narrative has definitely
[26:43] shifted away from running mining
[26:44] operations uh in a in a nation to
[26:47] acquire Bitcoin because I just pulled up
[26:49] my phone and just double checked to make
[26:50] sure I was right. Uh really there's only
[26:52] about 1 million Bitcoin left to be mined
[26:54] and that's going through 2140. Uh and
[26:57] the reality is for nations if they want
[26:59] to participate in Bitcoin, they can
[27:01] certainly go out and buy more. That
[27:02] would be much more efficient and direct
[27:03] and trying to build up infrastructure to
[27:05] mine. However, where it gets interesting
[27:07] is block space and hash rate because
[27:09] there's no network in the world that's
[27:11] more secure than Bitcoin. And if you
[27:13] want to inter uh if you want to
[27:14] transact, if you want to build and
[27:16] innovate on this Bitcoin layer, whether
[27:18] it's onchain or uh offchain, the reality
[27:22] is you need to have some uh plugin or
[27:26] some access to block space that you know
[27:28] you control that you know you can always
[27:29] rely on to get your your initiatives
[27:32] through, right? Uh and I think whether
[27:34] it goes through forms of owning your own
[27:36] hash rate and money on your own or
[27:38] partnering with the pool, that becomes
[27:39] very critical. We run one of the largest
[27:41] pools in the world. Uh and oftentimes we
[27:43] actually have nation states mind with us
[27:45] right uh can't divulge who they are and
[27:47] we ourselves are a very private company
[27:49] as well foundry we don't disclose our
[27:50] hash rate because oftentimes you don't
[27:53] want to show your hand right you have uh
[27:55] sovereign wealth funds in nation states
[27:56] out there oftent times they have to
[27:58] divulge how much MSTR how much Bitcoin
[28:01] uh reserves they have but they don't
[28:03] talk about what hash rate they're
[28:05] running right and I think that is
[28:06] actually very powerful for if you want
[28:08] to actually innovate and build on the
[28:10] Bitcoin protocol on this layer, it's
[28:13] good to control hash rate. So you make
[28:14] sure you have the safeguards uh and you
[28:17] have the channels to actually run your
[28:18] protocols. So to summarize, you need
[28:21] hash rate because you need to hit the
[28:23] blocks, but you need access to block
[28:26] space to and and look, you mentioned
[28:29] Russia earlier had had a certain like a
[28:31] high number of hash rate. They've been
[28:33] cut off from the global financial
[28:35] system, right? The US and its allies
[28:37] weaponize the financial system, cut them
[28:39] off from Swift. If you have access to
[28:41] blockchains and hash rate, you can
[28:44] contract. Sorry, you can transact. Your
[28:47] citizens can transact. So, I think these
[28:50] two components are vital, you know,
[28:52] going into the future. Alliances between
[28:56] pools and and gaining access is a vital
[28:58] component to national security and
[29:01] economic sovereignty of a country.
[29:03] Coming back to your earlier question
[29:06] when you asked how much hash rate should
[29:10] a nation state aim for? Well, I I think
[29:13] that's where it comes down to like
[29:16] having hash rate is basically the
[29:18] ability to have a say in the in the
[29:21] network like you're basically making
[29:23] sure that transactions are validated. So
[29:27] I think if that's not a strategic if
[29:31] like asset or position to hold for a
[29:36] nation state that then I don't know what
[29:37] is. Yeah. Bob Bernett actually has a
[29:40] really good number. He says that every
[29:41] nation should aspire to have at least
[29:44] the percentage GDP that they have of of
[29:46] the world GDP. That's the amount of hash
[29:48] rate. And I think that's actually a good
[29:50] number to aim for. Well, thank you very
[29:52] much. We are over time. Thank you for
[29:54] listening and please give a round of
[29:56] applause to our amazing panelists. Thank
[29:58] you.
