[00:03] [Music]
[00:06] Thank you. Thank you everybody for
[00:07] coming out and thank you to the
[00:08] organizers for having me. It's a
[00:09] pleasure and an honor to be here today.
[00:11] I'm going to be talking about Bitcoin
[00:13] and the dollar in particular about
[00:15] Tether and a lot of people think that
[00:17] Tether is going to be something that is
[00:19] very bullish to the dollar and and you
[00:22] know to be fair they found a whole new
[00:24] generation of bag holders around the
[00:26] world to buy the uh Treasury Shitcoin.
[00:29] So you would think that that would
[00:30] generally be bullish, but I'd like to
[00:31] take a closer look at it and see how
[00:33] bullish it actually is. So let us run
[00:36] some numbers. Let's assume for as a
[00:40] thought experiment, let's assume that
[00:41] Tether grows 100fold over the next 10
[00:44] years. That's a compound annual growth
[00:46] rate of 60% per year. So it gets to
[00:49] about a 20 trillion market cap by 2035.
[00:53] And now assume that they continue to put
[00:55] about 80% of their uh treasury and their
[00:59] backing of their uh notes into uh all
[01:04] maturities of US bonds. Currently
[01:06] they're only buying short maturities but
[01:07] assume they start buying across the
[01:09] curve across the yield curve. And uh to
[01:12] try and estimate the impact that this
[01:14] would have on the budget I've looked at
[01:16] the literature on the impact of
[01:18] purchases of bonds on the yields. So
[01:20] there's a lot of studies that have been
[01:22] done on what was the impact of QE you
[01:24] know when say if you buy 10% of the debt
[01:26] and you put it into uh what the impact
[01:29] would be on yields. So I think generally
[01:32] the literature says every 10% of the
[01:35] debt if you buy 10% of the debt you can
[01:37] bring yields down by uh 2 to 5%. But I'm
[01:42] going to assume 1%. I'm going to just
[01:45] have a maximum um most optimistic
[01:49] scenario in all of our assumptions here
[01:51] to try and see how this was would work
[01:52] out. So you buy 10% of the debt and you
[01:56] bring the yield down by 1%. So if we
[01:58] assume this is the case and then we
[02:01] project the impact on the US budget.
[02:04] Well, currently the debt is about $37
[02:06] trillion. The budget deficit is about $2
[02:08] trillion. And so if we assume that the
[02:12] budget deficit, the debt and the
[02:13] liabilities continue to rise at the same
[02:15] rate over the next 10 years as they did
[02:18] over the last 10 years, we could project
[02:20] it into the next 10 years. And you know,
[02:23] this is a extremely conservative um
[02:25] assumption because it's assuming that
[02:28] the next 10 years are going to be as
[02:29] inflationary as the previous 10. And I
[02:32] don't think that that is a warranted
[02:33] assumption, but we're going to go ahead
[02:34] with it anyway. Um, I think there's been
[02:36] a new normal since CO and I think this
[02:39] new administration confirms that the
[02:41] budget is going to just continue on the
[02:43] new normal level of spending that
[02:44] happened after CO and it's going to be
[02:46] different from what was taking place
[02:49] before CO which was relatively very uh
[02:52] fiscally and monetarily responsible
[02:54] compared to what's been happening since
[02:55] then. So, you know, looking now we see
[02:59] that Doge is seemingly not going to
[03:01] work. They're not going to be managing
[03:03] to bring down the budget by anything
[03:05] more than, you know, rounding errors.
[03:07] There's a bunch of wars coming up
[03:08] likely. Israel wants more land and, you
[03:11] know, they like more war. It's been a
[03:13] while since the US has fought a major
[03:15] war for um so likely there's going to be
[03:18] another one. So if you project those
[03:19] things, likely the budget is going to
[03:21] get a lot worse over the next 10 years,
[03:23] plus also the tariffs um and the impact
[03:26] that they'll have. So if we run these
[03:28] projections we'll see that basically by
[03:32] buying a lot of treasuries growing at
[03:34] 60% per year as we see in this table
[03:37] here we grow the treasuries of tether by
[03:40] 60% per year and we see that this is
[03:43] going to bring yields down right that's
[03:45] the way in which buying treasuries helps
[03:47] the US government in a practical sense
[03:50] the more treasuries tether buys the
[03:52] lower the yields become so we try and
[03:54] calculate this and try and projected uh
[03:57] onto 10 years from now and basically the
[04:00] most optimistic scenario according to
[04:03] these assumptions that I've just
[04:04] presented which are all basically airing
[04:05] on the side of becoming more and more
[04:07] optimistic it reduces the debt by about
[04:10] $3.7 trillion or 5.4% 4%
[04:14] of the debt over 10 years. This is I
[04:17] think maybe the most optimistic scenario
[04:19] you could probably present for the
[04:22] impact that tether could have on the US
[04:24] public debt. And in conclusion,
[04:27] basically nothing stops this train as
[04:29] Lyn Alden always says and not even
[04:32] Tether uh Tether cannot fix what a
[04:34] century of fiat democracy ruined.
[04:37] There's been a century of inflation, a
[04:38] century of debt, a century of
[04:39] liabilities piled up, and you're not
[04:41] just going to find an enormous number of
[04:44] bag holders that are going to be able to
[04:46] buy this. Um, ultimately, I think
[04:50] another point that is often ignored here
[04:53] is that a lot of the new demand, a lot
[04:55] of the demand that is coming for Tether
[04:56] is displaced demand. A lot of it is
[04:59] coming from people who are giving up on
[05:02] financial instruments that would have
[05:04] demanded treasuries otherwise. In other
[05:07] words, when u when a currency collapses
[05:09] and people in that country start using
[05:11] tether, they're decreasing the demand
[05:14] for treasuries by the central bank of
[05:16] the government whose currency has
[05:18] collapsed. So, it's not entirely new
[05:21] demand. And even if it were entirely new
[05:23] demand, even if we assume that 80% of
[05:25] it, as we did in the previous example,
[05:27] we still see that the impact on the uh
[05:30] debt situation in the US is not likely
[05:32] to be significant. It's not likely to
[05:34] make a significant difference because
[05:36] the amount of budget deficit is enormous
[05:39] and it's continuing to grow and the debt
[05:41] and the interest are continuing to grow
[05:43] and it won't touch the entitlements. it
[05:46] won't touch the defense spending and so
[05:48] therefore all of this new extra demand
[05:50] is not really going to make a big
[05:52] difference. It's ultimately no way to
[05:56] escape the inevitable fate of default
[06:00] devaluation or default by devaluation
[06:02] which are essentially all more or less
[06:04] the same thing that a lot of people who
[06:06] are owed a lot of liabilities are going
[06:08] to find out that they're not going to
[06:10] get what they want from them. So this is
[06:13] ultimately what I think is u more
[06:15] likely. Yes, it can help the uh fiscal
[06:19] position of the US government that more
[06:22] and more people are buying tether but I
[06:23] don't think it will make that big of a
[06:24] difference. But where does that leave
[06:26] tether? I think there's an interesting
[06:27] question here to ask which is what is
[06:30] the impact that is going to have on
[06:32] tether given that their reserves are
[06:34] being devalued or that they might
[06:36] default on. So devaluation is not a big
[06:38] problem for Tether because their
[06:40] liabilities devalue as well. When the
[06:42] dollar goes down, the value of their
[06:45] liabilities and their asset goes down.
[06:47] So that's not a big problem. The bigger
[06:48] risk for them, of course, is default.
[06:50] Default is the main risk. And in
[06:52] particular, you know, uh could be that
[06:54] the US government defaults specifically
[06:55] on Tether's bonds. Um, specifically
[06:58] after they buy a lot of bonds, the US
[07:00] government could just say, "Oh, well,
[07:01] somebody was involved in some criminal
[07:03] transaction with Tether. Therefore, all
[07:05] of your bonds are cancelled." They've
[07:07] done it with Russia. Maybe they'll do it
[07:09] with Tether again at some point. Now,
[07:10] Tether are smartly hedging against this
[07:13] and protecting themselves from this by
[07:15] doing the smart thing that everybody
[07:16] should be doing, which is buying
[07:18] Bitcoin. It's the smartest thing that
[07:20] anybody could do. So, currently, Tether
[07:22] has over 100,000 bitcoins, which is
[07:24] worth more than $10 billion. and their
[07:27] US dollar denominated reserves and
[07:29] treasuries are around 120 billion. So
[07:31] currently they've got more than 10 times
[07:33] as much fiat as they do Bitcoin.
[07:36] However, if there's one thing we know
[07:39] about Bitcoin, it's that it has number
[07:41] go up technology. And if there's one
[07:42] thing we know about the dollar, it's
[07:44] that it has number go down technology.
[07:47] Now, one thing keeps going up, the other
[07:49] thing keeps going down. Inevitably, the
[07:52] thing that goes up is going to overtake
[07:54] the things that go down. And so whether
[07:57] through default, devaluation, or both,
[08:00] Tether's Bitcoin reserves will likely
[08:02] eventually overtake its US dollar
[08:04] reserves, the ways in which we get there
[08:07] might be different. But as long as
[08:08] Tether keeps buying more and more
[08:10] Bitcoin, which they seem not to be
[08:13] stopping, and which seems to be a very
[08:15] wise thing for them to do because it's
[08:17] the only way to protect themselves from
[08:18] devaluation of the dollar and default on
[08:21] treasuries. As long as they keep doing
[08:23] that, the value of their Bitcoin
[08:25] reserves is going to continue to go up
[08:26] and likely it's going to overtake their
[08:29] US dollar reserves. Now, at this point,
[08:32] something that the Tether uh fudsters
[08:34] have said would happen might actually
[08:36] finally happen. You know, we've always
[08:38] heard the Tether is going to break the
[08:40] um peg and maybe it will happen in this
[08:43] situation because ultimately the real
[08:45] risk for Tether. The riskiest part of
[08:47] their business is the Treasury bonds.
[08:49] Treasury bonds, which are usually
[08:50] presented as the safe haven, are
[08:52] actually the main risk for Tether. And
[08:55] so over time, as their bonds devalue, as
[08:58] their dollars devalue, their bitcoins
[09:00] appreciate. And so therefore, they will
[09:02] be able to break the uh the backing of
[09:06] Tether with the dollar, but they would
[09:09] break the peg upwards. In other words,
[09:11] it would be possible for them at some
[09:13] point to revalue Tether upwards. And so
[09:16] they make it so that one tether is
[09:17] redeemable for $12.
[09:20] And then they could keep doing that
[09:21] further and further. They keep revaluing
[09:23] it upwards as the dollar drops. So
[09:25] tether becomes relatively stable coin
[09:28] while the dollar keeps devaluing. If
[09:30] they offered the world a dollar plus 2%
[09:32] per year or 1% per year that would that
[09:36] would be more attractive than the dollar
[09:38] for a lot of people. And so therefore we
[09:40] enter into this cycle where tether can
[09:42] increase its valuation which is going to
[09:44] increase demand for tether at the
[09:46] expense of the dollar which is going to
[09:48] then increase the amount of tether
[09:50] purchases of bitcoin which is going to
[09:52] drive up the bitcoin price further. And
[09:55] the key thing here is that even though
[09:57] Tether puts only a small percentage of
[09:58] its reserves in Bitcoin, because Bitcoin
[10:01] is so much smaller than the US debt
[10:03] market, that impact on the Bitcoin
[10:06] market is a lot more significant than
[10:08] the impact that they have with the
[10:10] majority of the reserves going into the
[10:13] debt uh the US government debt. So the
[10:16] US government has got some $37 trillion
[10:18] in debt, which is enormous. Bitcoin is
[10:20] only 2 trillion. So a tiny amount of
[10:22] money going into Bitcoin causes it to go
[10:25] up a lot more than the same amount of
[10:27] money going into the bond market. So
[10:29] Bitcoin price appreciates the more that
[10:31] Tether buys. That causes the Tether
[10:33] reserves to appreciate and that then
[10:36] helps them revalue their currency
[10:38] further and further and further. And
[10:40] eventually what we see is because of the
[10:43] way the fact that because of the fact
[10:44] that Tether is accumulating Bitcoin
[10:46] reserves, it can effectively grow its
[10:49] way out of being a bitcoin of being a
[10:52] dollar stable coin into becoming a
[10:55] stable coin that backs that is backed by
[10:57] Bitcoin. it can eventually redominate
[11:00] redenominate itself on in bitcoin terms
[11:04] eventually making it so that it just
[11:06] becomes another mechanism for the
[11:08] scaling of bitcoin. I think the key
[11:12] point to keep in mind is that the
[11:15] ability of Tether to prop up the debt
[11:17] market is extremely small because the
[11:20] debt market is so enormous and the world
[11:22] is already saturated with dollars and
[11:25] there's just not that much possibility
[11:27] for new dollar demand because the vast
[11:29] majority of financial uh sector u assets
[11:33] are essentially dollarbacked assets. On
[11:36] the other hand, the Bitcoin market is
[11:37] very small and so small demands into
[11:39] Bitcoin will go up and over time they're
[11:42] likely to maintain their value a lot
[11:44] better than their dollar reserves are
[11:45] going to do. So what we're having emerge
[11:48] right now is essentially rather than
[11:50] being a way to boost the dollar. I think
[11:54] Tetar is a good way to transition away
[11:57] from the dollar because by putting some
[11:59] of their reserves into Bitcoin, they're
[12:02] allowing the world to access the dollar
[12:04] now, but they're allowing the world
[12:06] access to Bitcoin as well. Now, add in
[12:08] the fact that by getting people to think
[12:12] about money in a digital way, by getting
[12:13] people to think about money in terms of
[12:16] uh private keys and uh public addresses,
[12:19] Tether is helping people think about
[12:21] Bitcoin. So the bottom line is that even
[12:25] the most bullish scenario for the US
[12:27] dollar, even the most imaginable way in
[12:30] which the US dollar's
[12:33] uh fate can be improved is finding an
[12:36] enormous amount of bag holders all over
[12:39] the world to buy US dollar treasury
[12:41] shitcoins. And yet even that scenario is
[12:45] a lot more bullish for Bitcoin than it
[12:47] is for the US dollar. Ultimately, even a
[12:50] lot of buying of treasuries is likely
[12:54] going to be a lot more bullish for
[12:55] Bitcoin. It's going to make a lot more
[12:57] of a difference for Bitcoin because of
[12:59] the fact that Tether is accumulating
[13:01] Bitcoin reserves because it's smart for
[13:02] them to accumulate Bitcoin reserves
[13:04] because this the best way for them to
[13:05] protect against the devaluation and the
[13:08] likely default that might happen. So, I
[13:12] don't really see this as being a um
[13:15] something that's going to boost the
[13:17] dollar. I don't think it can make enough
[13:18] of a difference in the dollar. And on
[13:20] the contrary, I think it's going to be
[13:23] more and more bullish for Bitcoin. The

[14:29] to you by the Daylight Computer. I love
[14:31] to work early in the morning and late at
[14:32] night or in the sun outdoors, but
[14:34] regular computer screens are terrible at
[14:36] these times, and they strain your eyes.
[14:39] For years, I've wanted a paper-like
[14:40] electronic screen on a simple computer I
[14:43] could use to write. I tried several
[14:45] models, but none were very good. Now,
[14:48] finally, Daylight have delivered a
[14:50] fantastic full function tablet with a
[14:52] paper-like screen that's easy on your
[14:54] eyes and great for outdoor use. I've
[14:57] been using the daylight computer to
[14:58] write my next book and it is absolutely
[15:01] fantastic and it has led me to invest in
[15:03] this company myself. Check out my
[15:06] interview with Anjan Kata in episode
[15:08] 249.
[15:10] So great to see you. This is our first
[15:12] in-person interview. I can't believe it.
[15:13] Thank you for coming on the show.
 Thank
[15:15] you for having me, Natalie. Always a
[15:16] pleasure to be talking to you.
 It's been
[15:18] a while. You've been busy writing
[15:20] another book. So I want to talk to you
[15:22] about the gold standard. But first, how
[15:23] are you finding this conference this
[15:25] year? cuz you've been to what, four or
[15:26] five of them?
 Uh, I think this is my
[15:29] third or fourth. I I've lost count.
[15:32] Honestly, they're all such a big
[15:33] whirlwind of events going on. They all
[15:36] blend into one big giant days of Bitcoin
[15:38] awesomeness.
 Yeah. So, tell me about
[15:41] this book. Um, because you have Bitcoin
[15:43] Standard, then Fiat Standard, you have
[15:44] now other authors under your umbrella.
[15:46] You had Principles of Economics, which
[15:48] was amazing, and now the gold standard.
[15:50] You're going deep. I mean, what have you
[15:52] not written about that you really wanted
[15:54] to dive into with this?
 Well, exactly.
[15:56] So, I, you know, I've covered the real
[15:58] world, so I had to invent a fake world
[16:00] to write about it now because there's
[16:01] nothing left to write about the real
[16:02] world, I guess. No, it's not true.
[16:05] Obviously, there's more to write about
[16:06] the real world, but I'd always wondered
[16:08] about what the world would have looked
[16:10] like without fiat money. Once you take
[16:12] the fiat bill and you start thinking
[16:14] about fiat and how fiat affects
[16:15] everything,
[16:17] it's really one of the most
[16:18] disconcerting realizations of just how
[16:21] much uh damage it has done to our world
[16:24] and how different our world would be
[16:26] without it. And once you start thinking
[16:29] about that, it's just almost consuming.
[16:31] You you keep thinking about what this
[16:33] means and what the implications are. And
[16:36] frankly, the implications are enormous.
[16:38] So uh I've always had this idea in my
[16:41] mind of trying to think about what the
[16:43] world would have looked like without
[16:44] fiat and because you know in economics a
[16:46] big part of economics is to think about
[16:47] the counterfactual.
[16:49] When you're making a choice in economics
[16:51] in human action you don't get to do a
[16:54] choice in a lab setting in isolation.
[16:56] Everything has an opportunity cost. Time
[16:58] is ticking. Life is irreversible and
[17:01] time just keeps moving on. And so
[17:04] therefore, you're always thinking about
[17:06] what might have been, what could have
[17:08] been. And you need to always think about
[17:09] it. And once you start conceptualizing
[17:12] the concept of opportunity cost and what
[17:14] could have been and the alternatives in
[17:16] your mind, that's when you start
[17:18] thinking properly in the economic sense.
[17:20] And so thinking about the question of
[17:22] fiat from that perspective
[17:24] inevitably leads you to think about what
[17:26] the world could have looked like.
 So
[17:28] it's a hypothetical.
 Yes. Book.
 It's a
[17:30] fiction book.
 It's a fiction book. Oh
[17:32] wow. I didn't realize that. I thought
[17:33] you were like digging deep on the gold
[17:35] standard with stuff covered before.
 No,
[17:38] I thought about doing that. I mean,
[17:40] initially that was the kind of natural
[17:43] consequence cuz I wrote Bitcoin fiat.
[17:45] So, you would have gone back wrote and
[17:47] written uh about the um history of gold
[17:50] as money and how the gold standard
[17:52] function and so on. But honestly, there
[17:55] are a lot of books written on gold and
[17:57] uh I don't really particularly have much
[17:59] to add particularly as it's you know
[18:01] kind of it's kind of a dead technology
[18:03] at this point. It's it's been out of
[18:04] commission for a while and a lot of it a
[18:06] lot has been written already about it.
[18:08] But what I did have in mind was the idea
[18:10] for the counterfactual and I started
[18:12] working on the counterfactual and then
[18:13] it occurred to me that okay I should
[18:15] just name it the gold standard and then
[18:16] complete the trilogy.
 Interesting. Okay.
[18:19] But I mean, you say it's a dead
[18:20] technology, but central banks have been
[18:22] buying up gold. Gold is in the headlines
[18:24] every single day. Some people are
[18:26] talking about the US potentially moving
[18:28] back to a neutral reserve asset being
[18:31] gold, not not Bitcoin yet. Um, what do
[18:34] you think about all of that and how how
[18:36] the monetary system in real time is
[18:38] actually changing?
 I doubt it. I doubt
[18:40] that we're going to get a move to gold.
[18:43] I think um governments just don't like
[18:45] gold. They're heavily propagandized
[18:47] against gold. and they heavily
[18:49] propagandize their populations against
[18:51] gold. So um I mean yeah it would be
[18:54] obviously an improvement over the dollar
[18:56] if we were to have an truly neutral
[18:58] international monetary system that uh
[19:01] could not be produced by any one
[19:02] particular government.
[19:05] But it doesn't look like it's happening.
[19:07] And um all these BRICS countries, they
[19:09] keep talking about it or they keep
[19:10] making noises about it or really it's
[19:12] mostly westerners who um you know gold
[19:16] bugs who just keep projecting their
[19:20] dreams and wishes upon uh the bricks and
[19:22] just imagine either they're going to
[19:23] pull this off but they are not going to
[19:25] pull it off. The dollar is a is the
[19:27] biggest most liquid market. It's the
[19:29] easiest one to use and you don't have a
[19:32] liquid market infrastructure.
[19:35] You don't have market infrastructure to
[19:37] make gold liquid on an international
[19:38] scale. That's what's ultimately missing.
[19:40] So, there isn't a market for the
[19:42] clearance of gold. And that's a
[19:43] practical thing that needs to be built
[19:45] and it's not something that you can just
[19:47] mandate with a press release. You want
[19:49] to have a very uh um fluid, smooth,
[19:55] functional, cheap, reliable mechanism
[19:57] for moving gold from one country to the
[19:59] other. And these countries need to be
[20:01] building these systems. And they can be
[20:03] built easily and they can be built
[20:04] cheaply, but um they're not building
[20:08] them. So I don't think it's happening.
[20:11] And I think if they start thinking about
[20:13] building them practically, if they start
[20:14] really thinking about gold in a
[20:16] practical sense, all that's going to
[20:17] happen is they're going to then truly
[20:19] understand the value of Bitcoin.
 So you
[20:21] don't think that they could potentially
[20:22] revalue the gold that the US currently
[20:25] has to today's market prices to maybe do
[20:29] an accounting trick essentially to
[20:31] address the deficit or no?
 No, no, it
[20:34] doesn't make difference. I mean the uh
[20:36] items on the asset side of the US
[20:39] government balance sheet are essentially
[20:43] um worthless. It doesn't matter how much
[20:46] assets they have. They just have a money
[20:48] printer and that's the only asset they
[20:49] need. So it doesn't matter they can
[20:51] value the bit they can value the gold or
[20:53] the bitcoin at $1 each or a trillion
[20:55] dollar each. It's all u
[20:59] it it's all baloney on their balance
[21:01] sheet. ultimately they've got the money
[21:03] printer and as long as the money printer
[21:04] works then they don't need assets.
[21:07] What is the biggest headwind facing
[21:09] Bitcoin right now? Because we do have a
[21:10] lot of um positive momentum when it
[21:12] comes to the regulatory and the the
[21:14] political forces, but we're still I mean
[21:17] some people are disappointed that we
[21:18] haven't hit like 200,000 and that the
[21:20] early majority is really not there. So
[21:22] what's preventing that for Bitcoin?
[21:25] Yeah, it's a good question. Um, I don't
[21:28] really think there is uh any one
[21:30] particular thing that stands out as a
[21:32] headwind because it's hard to identify a
[21:34] headwind on the fastest thing that has
[21:36] ever existed. Uh, we've never had any
[21:39] financial asset move as fast as Bitcoin
[21:41] has. So, uh, you know, I think the
[21:45] question is what are all the
[21:47] turbochargers that are pushing it so
[21:49] quickly? Uh, that's a more appropriate
[21:52] question. So, but on the other hand, you
[21:54] can kind of think, yeah, I mean, once
[21:56] once you get into Bitcoin and once you
[21:57] get it, there's that immediate feeling
[22:00] that, oh this is going to do a
[22:02] 1,000x over the next week because
[22:04] everybody's going to find out because if
[22:06] I can get it, then everybody's going to
[22:07] get it and everybody's going to do it.
[22:10] And so that doesn't happen. You know,
[22:12] every noob comes in, they get over
[22:13] excited, and then they learn to lower
[22:16] their time preference and start, you
[22:18] know, planting the garden of the Bitcoin
[22:23] world that they want to see rather than
[22:25] just expecting it all to materialize
[22:27] within a few uh minutes or hours or days
[22:31] or weeks. So, um, if I were to think of
[22:35] something, I just think, um, sadly
[22:38] people just aren't that bright. And, uh,
[22:41] people are heavily propagandized to
[22:44] believe in government as the source of
[22:46] money. And they're heavily propagandized
[22:48] to believe that, uh, government dictates
[22:50] what money is. And, uh, they um, you
[22:54] know, people love their chains and
[22:56] people get grow used to their chains.
[22:58] And they cannot conceive of a world
[23:00] without their chains. and they'd rather
[23:02] laugh at the person who's telling them
[23:04] that they could get rid of their chains
[23:05] than to try and actually move and
[23:07] realize that their chains are actually
[23:09] in their mind because it's really
[23:11] actually very straightforward to get rid
[23:12] of your chains. Since Bitcoin has been
[23:14] invented, that's it. You know, you've
[23:15] got the key. You can just unlock them
[23:16] and move on with your life. But
 well,
[23:20] it's so crazy to see the complacency um
[23:22] even in Wall Street. I mean this is the
[23:24] best performing asset of the last decade
[23:26] and there are still firms that are so
[23:28] terrified to allocate to Bitcoin or
[23:30] their charters prevent them from
[23:31] allocating to Bitcoin. Everyone is like
[23:33] terrified looking for permission from
[23:35] places like Larry Frink and Black
[23:36] Rockck. What What is your take on sort
[23:38] of the institutionalization of Bitcoin
[23:40] and do you think it's a good thing?
[23:43] Um yeah, I mean it's a um I mean there's
[23:47] no good and bad in in Bitcoin. It's a
[23:50] it's
 inevitable. Yeah, it's inevitable
[23:52] and also it's it's not up to me to
[23:54] decide what other people do with their
[23:56] Bitcoin. So, um I can't really think of
[23:58] it in a sense of whether I
[24:02] can think of it as good or bad per se.
[24:06] You know, I have my own personal
[24:08] opinions, which is I'd rather not have
[24:10] uh Wall Street banks be buying Bitcoin
[24:13] as a matter of personal preference. I'd
[24:15] rather a lot of other people around the
[24:17] world manage to get all of these cheap
[24:19] sub 100k
[24:22] uh bitcoins, but at the you know, I
[24:25] can't uh I can't decide who buys
[24:27] bitcoin.
 What do you think about the
[24:28] corporate treasuries? I mean, because
[24:30] there's so many popping up and I I'm a
[24:32] little worried about the next bare
[24:33] market because I don't I don't think
[24:35] that all of them can survive and maybe
[24:36] some might take on too much leverage and
[24:38] that could be worrisome.
 Yeah. Yeah. I
[24:41] mean, uh, all the leverage is just
[24:42] building up just in time for, uh, the
[24:44] top and the, uh, bust. I mean, I I just
[24:50] hope my message out there to everybody
[24:52] who's into this business is Bitcoin has
[24:54] done negative 70 and negative 80% before
[24:57] and it can do it again. If your business
[25:00] model can't handle a negative 80%
[25:03] Bitcoin draw down,
[25:06] rework your business model right now
[25:08] because you know I think we're getting
[25:10] toward the uh we're getting toward the
[25:12] very shaky ground of the top and the
[25:16] fall from it. Historically our top
 I
[25:18] think so I mean historically this is
[25:20] usually the time when we get the top
[25:22] between one year and 18 months after the
[25:24] having
 we're actually underperforming
[25:27] the last havinging cycles like we we
[25:29] should be up higher in terms of the
[25:30] price.
 Well yeah if you measure from the
[25:33] time of the having but the difference is
[25:34] that usually the bull market would have
[25:37] started just before the having but now
[25:40] we had a significant bull market well
[25:41] before the having. So that's why it
[25:43] looks like we're underperforming since
[25:44] the having. But you know since the
[25:46] bottom we were up from what was it 15K
[25:50] to 109.
[25:52] That's not inconsiderable. 110 I think
[25:54] we hit is the highest. We're at 11 I
[25:56] think.
 112. Yeah
 112. Yeah I think 112
[25:58] was the highest. So 115 to sorry 15 to
[26:02] 112. That's uh sevenfold. Uh
 so you
[26:06] don't think we're going to like 200k
[26:08] this year?
 No we might. But I think um I
[26:12] think there's a good chance we go over
[26:13] 200k,
[26:15] but I think we're getting to that point
[26:16] where uh it's going to be very volatile
[26:19] both ways. We likely, you know, we're
[26:21] going to get to that uh flat uh not
[26:24] flat, sorry, that that vertical side uh
[26:26] that vertical part of the curve where
[26:27] the where it goes up a lot.
 Blowoff top.
[26:30] Yes, the blowoff top where goes up a lot
[26:31] and then it uh crashes. I mean
 yeah we
[26:35] didn't get it last time because we kind
[26:36] of had two and then there was the China
[26:38] minor ban in the middle
 but
[26:40] realistically still
 it was uh 12 to 18
[26:44] months after the having where the top
[26:47] happened.
 So the macro side I mean don't
[26:49] you think there's like a big print
[26:51] that's incoming because there's going to
[26:52] be enough tremors in the financial
[26:54] markets and the treasury market that
[26:55] they're going to have to come in and
[26:56] liqufy and that's going to be great for
[26:58] Bitcoin
 maybe. Maybe. But you know
[27:01] people have been saying that for a very
[27:02] long time. People have been expecting
[27:03] that for a long time. It may happen. But
[27:06] uh ultimately I generally still fall
[27:10] back on my thesis that Bitcoin marches
[27:12] to its own drum beat. And yes, I think
[27:14] the liquidity stuff matters a lot, but
[27:16] it matters a lot more in the short term.
[27:18] And I guess it matters in kind of uh
[27:22] also in terms of drawing the long-term
[27:24] magnitudes probably it matters. But uh
[27:27] I think I think ultimately it's uh it's
[27:30] it it marches to its own drum beat.
 So
[27:32] you obviously wrote the Bitcoin Standard
[27:35] um Safe and you know that that book
[27:37] really changed my life. It has changed
[27:39] the lives of a lot of people. A lot of
[27:41] them came here to see you. Thank you.
[27:43] Get you to sign the book. You've sold a
[27:46] million copies, right? I mean that's
[27:47] quite an accomplishment because you're
[27:49] self-published. You were basically the
[27:51] first big Bitcoin book out there. What
[27:53] does it feel like to have sold a million
[27:56] copies around the world? That's
[27:57] incredible.
 Yeah, it feels great. Um,
[28:00] definitely uh not what I had expected. I
[28:03] was writing a book about Bitcoin because
[28:05] I felt I needed to write it because
[28:06] otherwise I was just arguing with people
[28:08] on Facebook all the time and because I
[28:09] needed to keep my job as an academic and
[28:12] uh it uh it definitely blew up far
[28:14] further than I expected.
 How are we
[28:16] going to get the early majority really
[28:18] on boarded?
[28:21] You know, I'm going to start uh I I'm
[28:23] going to start working on a curriculum
[28:25] for children, for school children.
 Oh,
[28:27] that's great.
 I'm going to work on a
[28:28] Bitcoin guide similar to the Bitcoin
[28:30] standard, but simplified so that a 14,
[28:34] 12 year old can read it and enjoy it and
[28:37] learn the most important ideas from it
[28:38] and learn. Yeah,
 money and Bitcoin
[28:41] that's so needed.
 Yeah,
 I think it is
[28:43] needed. And I think, you know, the
[28:44] Bitcoin stand is a little too heavy for,
[28:48] you know, I mean, I I know some
[28:49] 12-year-olds and four year olds who have
[28:51] read it, but I think,
 yeah,
 for the
[28:53] average 12-year-old, it's probably a
[28:54] little too heavy. And also, you know, a
[28:56] little too elaborate. They don't need to
[28:58] know a lot about the details.
 For sure.
[29:01] And they just need to know the key and
[29:03] uh important ideas and how they apply in
[29:05] their life.
 You've been in the space for
[29:07] so long now. Can you just share kind of
[29:09] how you've seen the evolution of the
[29:11] Bitcoin culture, the ecosystem? I mean,
[29:13] now now we're embraced by the White
[29:15] House.
 We're at this conference with
[29:17] 30,000 people. I mean, what what's it
[29:19] been like to see the growth?
[29:22] It's been surreal. I mean, I think I I I
[29:24] did not expect governments and
[29:25] corporations to come in so early. I
[29:27] would have expected if I if you were to
[29:29] ask me say seven, eight, nine years ago
[29:32] what I would expect for the year 2025, I
[29:36] would say I probably would have expected
[29:38] a lot more uh broad grassroots adoption.
[29:42] more and more random normal people in
[29:46] the US and Venezuela and Lebanon and
[29:48] China and Germany and all over the world
[29:52] buying small amounts of Bitcoin and
[29:53] stacking over time and uh not enough or
[29:58] not a lot of banks, finance, Wall
[30:01] Street, these things. I I I would have
[30:06] expected it to be that way, but it seems
[30:08] to have gone the other way. Um, we're
[30:10] getting the concentrated adoption where,
[30:13] you know, large money uh is buying in
[30:16] quantities. People like Sailor,
[30:18] corporations, banks, Black Rockck. Um,
[30:21] it's really wild. The Bitcoin Standard

[31:52] Do you think that wealth concentration
[31:54] will decrease under a Bitcoin standard?
[31:58] Um, I mean, obviously there's always
[32:01] inequality, but do you think it's going
[32:02] to be as concentrated in terms of wealth
[32:05] as it is today? Because really, we don't
[32:07] have a meritocracy, right? Like it's all
[32:08] flown to people closest to the issuers.
[32:11] Could that change? The thing is I I
[32:13] think the term inequality mathematically
[32:15] there are many different ways of
[32:16] measuring it and uh I don't think any of
[32:20] them is valid in a sense because um I
[32:23] mean yeah you can use the genie
[32:24] coefficient you can say measure the
[32:26] ratio between the top 10% and the bottom
[32:28] 10%. Each one of them gives a different
[32:31] emphasis to the question but there's no
[32:33] correct way of analyzing the question or
[32:36] uh objective way of analyzing the
[32:38] question because
[32:41] it's just it it plays out in many
[32:43] different ways that can have very
[32:44] different implications in many different
[32:45] ways and so it's not uh it's not obvious
[32:49] which one would be the best um measure
[32:53] for this but in a sense I don't honestly
[32:57] think it matters. So the question of
[32:59] will Bitcoin be more unequal or not,
[33:02] it's difficult to answer it because it
[33:04] could be more unequal in the sense that
[33:08] there's a small little.1%
[33:10] who control an enormous chunk of the
[33:13] Bitcoin, but outside of that.1% the rest
[33:16] of society might be more similar and uh
[33:19] or less unequal, let's say, and of of a
[33:22] similar income profile
[33:24] better than in fiat. So which one is
[33:26] more unequal in this regard if you just
[33:28] ignore the.1% if you include it. So it's
[33:31] difficult to estimate something like
[33:33] this. It's difficult to predict it. But
[33:35] even if we were able to predict it, it's
[33:37] difficult to compare those two different
[33:40] uh distributions of income to be able to
[33:42] come up with which one would be more
[33:44] equal or unequal. And for me ultimately
[33:47] it doesn't really matter because I don't
[33:48] think this is an interesting question
[33:50] intellectually, politically or morally.
[33:53] I don't think this is a good thing for
[33:55] anybody to be doing just trying to think
[33:58] about how much money they have in
[34:00] compared to other people and uh you know
[34:03] I think it's um it's something that uh
[34:07] you see in children and it's something
[34:08] that well raised children are raised to
[34:12] stop doing at at a certain point
[34:14] sometime when you're seven between seven
[34:16] and 14 I would imagine is the time when
[34:18] you need to be taught to stop comparing
[34:21] yourself to others Stop fixating on the
[34:24] toys that other kids have. Focus on your
[34:26] own toys. Focus on enjoying yourself
[34:28] with your own toys. And if you learn
[34:31] that, then it doesn't matter what toys
[34:33] you have, you will be happy.
 That's an
[34:34] interesting.
 And if you don't learn
[34:36] that, it doesn't matter how many toys
[34:38] you have, you will be unhappy. You will
[34:40] always be looking at the other kid who
[34:41] has the toy that you don't have. And no
[34:43] matter how much your parents buy you
[34:44] toys, if you keep looking at other toys,
[34:46] there will always be kids with toys that
[34:48] you don't have. And so you'll always be
[34:50] miserable. On the other hand, if you are
[34:53] happy with what you have, if you're able
[34:55] to focus on what you have or making the
[34:56] most of what you have, you could get an
[34:58] empty box and you'll be very happy with
[35:00] all the toys that you can make out of
[35:01] it.
 That's an interesting way to to put
[35:03] it. Okay. Um, one of the things I'm
[35:06] grateful to you for teaching me is
[35:08] actually the fact that we don't need an
[35:10] inflationary monetary supply that really
[35:12] any amount of money will do as long as
[35:14] it's divisible. Um, can you touch on
[35:17] that just a little bit because I even
[35:18] recently had Judy Shelton on the show
[35:20] and one of the things that was hard for
[35:22] her about Bitcoin is that absolute
[35:24] finite scarcity and she kind of compared
[35:27] it to dividing was actually was like
[35:29] issuing more shares of stock and I was
[35:30] like no no no no because you're not
[35:32] diluting anyone you're just dividing
[35:34] right and then some people came back to
[35:35] me and said no Bitcoin's not infinitely
[35:37] divisible and I was assuming on
[35:40] secondary layers it actually is that's
[35:41] what I've read so can you comment a
[35:43] little bit bit about that like why is a
[35:45] finite scarce amount of money good for
[35:48] society and is Bitcoin infinitely
[35:50] divisible? Can it meet all the needs of
[35:52] society no matter how large the economy
[35:54] grows?
 So the first question really is
[35:57] the most important question in economics
[35:58] I would say and I it was really the
[36:02] moment where it clicked for me. I I
[36:04] would say this was the moment where
[36:05] Bitcoin clicked even though Bitcoin
[36:07] hadn't been invented yet but it was the
[36:09] moment where I became a Bitcoiner even
[36:10] before Bitcoin. It was when I was
[36:12] reading a paper by Mario Rothbart called
[36:15] the Austrian theory of money. It's a
[36:18] short paper, something like 20 30 pages
[36:19] or so, but it really might be the best
[36:23] summary of money from Austrian economics
[36:26] perspective, which for me is basically
[36:28] the best treatment of money. Full stop.
[36:31] So it's a great great article and he
[36:33] goes over the main ideas in mises and in
[36:36] the Austrian tradition and he concludes
[36:38] with saying any supply of money is
[36:41] enough because money is acquired for its
[36:44] purchasing power not its quantity not
[36:47] its objective uses. So it's one thing
[36:50] it's unique. Mises calls it a sui
[36:52] generous good. It's a good unlike
[36:54] others. There's no good like money. With
[36:56] every other good you derive some
[36:58] benefit, some utility from the good
[37:02] itself in whichever form or shape it
[37:04] takes. Whereas with money, the good
[37:07] itself, its physical manifestation is
[37:11] almost immaterial to its um ability to
[37:14] fulfill its function. What matters is
[37:17] its ability to um is its purchasing
[37:20] power. How much you can exchange it for.
[37:22] So money is something that you acquire
[37:24] for exchange. It's a medium of exchange.
[37:26] You acquire it for only so that you can
[37:28] exchange it. So therefore, what matters
[37:30] is how you exchange it and how much you
[37:34] can exchange it for. And so therefore,
[37:36] you don't need to increase the quantity
[37:39] of money. you can just increase the
[37:41] purchasing power of the existing money
[37:43] for meeting the demand for money for
[37:46] more goods for more people. So any
[37:48] quantity of money can be enough because
[37:50] you can always just pump more purchasing
[37:53] power into it. That's ultimately the key
[37:56] idea and that's how it fundamentally
[37:58] works in that um if the demand for any
[38:02] good increases the demand is increasing
[38:05] for the good itself for its ability to
[38:06] perform its function. So if you want
[38:08] water, if you want a car, if you want a
[38:10] table, you know, people want those
[38:11] tables and they need them to do those
[38:13] functions. But as um
[38:17] as the demand for them increases, you
[38:19] need to produce more. So then you need
[38:20] to, you know, generate more. But with
[38:23] money, you don't need to generate more
[38:25] because all you need to do is just have
[38:28] the purchasing power rise. And so as the
[38:31] demand increases, then purchasing the
[38:35] market value increases. And so any
[38:37] quantity of demand can be met as the
[38:39] value of the currency appreciates over
[38:41] time.
 Don't you need to be able to
[38:42] divide it too? It helps when you have 8
[38:44] billion bodies around the world, right?
[38:45] And Bitcoin's fractionary. So
 yeah.
[38:48] Well, I mean to be fair, you know, um I
[38:52] guess there is some kind of physical
[38:53] limit at a certain point that shows up
[38:56] when the coin uh when the physical money
[38:59] or or when the form of money is no
[39:00] longer divisible in a way that is
[39:02] convenient for most transactions. So we
[39:04] saw that happen with gold. The reason
[39:05] that silver maintained a monetary role
[39:08] was because in small denominations you
[39:10] couldn't really cut gold into very small
[39:12] fine pieces and go silver had usually a
[39:15] value that was about a 12th to a 15eenth
[39:18] of gold's value. So it meant that you
[39:20] needed a 12th of the weight. So you
[39:22] could make easy uh denominations smaller
[39:25] and you could easily see them and
[39:27] understand what they were.
[39:30] But then after um gold took over, you
[39:33] know, part of the reason why gold was
[39:35] centralized was because it uh you know,
[39:38] for smaller denominations, you needed
[39:40] papers or uh uh fiat coins, essentially
[39:43] coins that were made out of cheap metals
[39:45] that were redeemable for uh precious
[39:48] metals. So essentially, part of the
[39:51] reason why we ended up with uh using
[39:54] money substitutes rather than money is
[39:56] because of the inability of gold to
[39:57] scale downward. you couldn't just uh
[40:00] effortlessly break a 1 oz piece of gold
[40:03] into 10 ounces or 12 uh pieces of uh a
[40:07] 12th of an ounce and so therefore it's
[40:10] less u
[40:12] less divisible. So yeah, I think there
[40:15] um with Bitcoin this is kind of a uh a
[40:19] uh a potential uh hurdle problem down
[40:23] the road which is a certain point a
[40:26] satoshi becomes too valuable. So
[40:29] currently $1 is a thousand satoshi's
[40:32] when bitcoin when we hit $1 million one
[40:35] satoshi will be one cent. So at that
[40:38] point you know well at this point you
[40:41] know nobody really uses a scent. They're
[40:42] going to put cents out of a commission
[40:44] in the US.
 Yeah. The penny.
 Yeah. The
[40:45] penny is going to be out of use. And so
[40:48] by the time Bitcoin hits a 100, sorry,
[40:50] by the time Bitcoin hits a million,
[40:51] pennies are going to be less worth less
[40:54] and less. So when Satoshi's hit a penny,
[40:57] there still we we it's not going to be a
[41:00] problem. But when Satoshi's hit a dime,
[41:03] you know, maybe by the time they hit a
[41:04] dime, even that won't be a problem. But
[41:06] maybe when Satoshi hits a dollar, then
[41:08] yeah, that's going to be a problem at
[41:10] that point. So then you know I I I've
[41:14] heard different things from different
[41:16] people. So I don't really know. Uh some
[41:18] people say it's something that can be
[41:20] implemented on chain. It can be revised.
[41:23] Others say it can be implemented on
[41:25] second layer solutions that you can uh
[41:27] that's my friend
 add basically a decimal
[41:29] point and start adding more zeros.
[41:32] I do not know but you know by the time
[41:36] we get to one bit once Satoshi is $1, um
[41:40] I'm going to be ready to confront such a
[41:42] question.
 All right, my last question
[41:44] for you is what is maybe a dream that
[41:48] Bitcoin has allowed you to have come
[41:51] true?
[41:54] Well, I mean uh I mean the most
[41:56] important dream obviously is my family.
[41:58] um having the ability to take care of my
[42:00] family and provide for them and um to
[42:03] work my uh job as a writer and writing
[42:07] things that I want, teaching things that
[42:08] I like and also provide for my family,
[42:10] doing the things that I love to do and
[42:13] things that I uh think are valued by
[42:16] others. I think it's just uh a blessing
[42:18] that I uh I'm extremely grateful for on
[42:21] every day and uh something that I don't
[42:23] take for granted. I think it's it's a
[42:25] true blessing. Well, we're blessed to
[42:27] have your mind in the space. Thank you
[42:29] so much, Safe. I'm glad we got to do
[42:30] this.
 We're blessed to have you,
[42:31] Natalie. Thank you so much.
 I'm going to
[42:32] get myself a copy of the Gold Standard.
[42:35] Thank you.
