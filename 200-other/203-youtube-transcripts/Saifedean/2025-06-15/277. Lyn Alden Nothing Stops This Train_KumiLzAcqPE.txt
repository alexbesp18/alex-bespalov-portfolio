[00:05] Hello, welcome to the Bitcoin Standard
[00:06] podcast. Our guest today is Lynn Alden,
[00:10] the author of Broken Money, out now from
[00:13] the safe house. You can get it along
[00:15] with my books as well as Fiat Food
[00:19] Gradually then suddenly and now the
[00:21] Bitcoin enlightenment from the
[00:23] safehouse.com.
[00:25] And Lynn has also recently um coined the
[00:29] phrase nothing stops this train to
[00:32] discuss the uh fiscal situation of the
[00:35] United States government. And uh I
[00:38] thought it would be good to bring her
[00:39] along to discuss this. We've had Lynn
[00:42] over I think twice before or three times
[00:44] maybe even something like that. Yeah.
[00:47] Yeah. Something like that. And um it's
[00:50] always fun to catch up on what is going
[00:52] on in the broader macro world and find
[00:57] ever newer ways of arriving at the
[00:59] conclusion of uh why Bitcoin. So let's
[01:02] do it again. Welcome. Happy to. Thank
[01:04] you. Thanks for having me. All right. So
[01:08] uh yeah, we were just in uh Vegas a few
[01:11] days ago. we met uh during the Bitcoin
[01:13] conference and you gave a talk titled
[01:18] nothing stops this train and I thought
[01:20] it was a very interesting uh talk and um
[01:24] I think beyond just the usual um fiscal
[01:28] doom and gloom there's a deeper thesis
[01:31] there do you mind uh telling us a little
[01:34] bit more about it sure and and I think
[01:37] there's there's been like two phases
[01:38] where I've covered this um and so
[01:40] starting back in like 2019 and
[01:42] particularly in 2020, I started to
[01:44] emphasize um the the sheer fiscal
[01:47] activity that was happening. Um and some
[01:50] of that was happening before uh the
[01:52] whole lockdown pandemic uh situation,
[01:54] but then obviously it went into
[01:55] overdrive uh in 2020. And uh one of the
[01:59] things I was doing at the time was
[02:00] pointing out that this was very
[02:01] different than some of the mechanics we
[02:02] were seeing back in the global financial
[02:04] crisis. This wasn't just say QE for like
[02:07] bank recapitalization.
[02:08] Um this was actually basically QE to
[02:11] monetize unusually large fiscal deficits
[02:14] that were actually getting out into the
[02:15] broader uh non-banking system economy.
[02:18] Um and so kind of my view at the time
[02:20] was this this has very different
[02:22] implications. Uh and then as they
[02:23] continued the implication was this was
[02:25] going to be uh inflationary for for
[02:27] prices not just uh money supply. Um and
[02:31] so uh that's been a key part of my
[02:33] investment thesis has made me bullish on
[02:34] a number of assets. Um, I had big
[02:37] debates with kind of like the bond bulls
[02:39] at the time. They were saying, "No, this
[02:40] is not real money printing. It's going
[02:42] to be uh disinflationary still." Um, and
[02:45] so that was kind of my whole endeavor
[02:47] back then. Um, and I started using the
[02:50] phrase nothing stops this train uh, I
[02:52] believe around early 2023 or so. And
[02:55] that was because we went through this
[02:57] very very brief window where we had a
[02:59] narrow fiscal contraction. So in 2020,
[03:01] 2021 that was like the crazy money
[03:03] printing years. 2022 is when they really
[03:05] tried to hawk it up. They they tried to
[03:07] you know they raised interest rates. Um
[03:09] they uh most of the the kind of the
[03:11] pandemic era programs were were like
[03:13] over dialed back uh to some extent. And
[03:16] so we saw this contraction in the broad
[03:18] money supply. We saw this um contraction
[03:20] in private credit. We saw this reduction
[03:22] in public deficits. Um but by kind of
[03:26] late 2022 or early 2023 as public
[03:30] interest expense ramped up uh federal uh
[03:33] uh interest expense on the debt um we
[03:35] actually started to get rising deficits
[03:37] again even though they were still trying
[03:39] to be hawkish um and so that's when I
[03:42] kind of emphasized that we are entering
[03:43] like kind of another cycle now of where
[03:45] fiscal leading again less explosively uh
[03:48] than that whole 2020 and 2021 period um
[03:52] but more persistently in the sense that
[03:54] it's not tied to any one catalyst. It's
[03:56] not this like one uh thing that's
[03:58] happening. It's it's back to the broader
[04:00] trend now on steroids. Um and so my my
[04:03] key kind of emphasis was kind of fading
[04:06] some of the disinflationary themes or
[04:09] even some of the recession themes. Uh
[04:11] and instead emphasizing that when you're
[04:13] running six or 7% deficit of GDP, um
[04:16] that's a pretty different investing
[04:18] environment and a different economic
[04:19] environment than many people are used to
[04:21] outside of a recession. uh and that has
[04:24] that has all sorts of implications. So
[04:26] I've been kind of pounding the table on
[04:28] the the power of fiscal um before the
[04:31] pandemic, during the pandemic, and now
[04:33] even recently after that whole period.
[04:36] Yeah. And I think it's um it's really a
[04:40] combination of factors all coming in
[04:42] together. the uh
[04:44] demographics plus all of these new u
[04:48] things of u all these new ideas for
[04:51] spending that came out after co and
[04:54] defense ramping up as well all of these
[04:57] major things they're just all coming up
[04:59] at the same time and as you say the uh
[05:04] the perhaps the most significant factor
[05:07] is that this is coming at a time when
[05:09] interest rates seem to be rising And
[05:12] every time before there was a constant
[05:14] decline in interest rates that continued
[05:16] to make the growing burden of debt
[05:20] appear lighter and lighter and lighter
[05:22] over time it would look like h it's the
[05:25] interest expense is declining because
[05:27] the interest is declining. So growing
[05:29] debt doesn't sound like such a terrible
[05:30] idea but now the interest is increasing
[05:34] and therefore the debt servicing is also
[05:37] increasing.
[05:39] Yeah. A lot of these things are
[05:40] happening together which is why it's so
[05:42] persistent. It's a really big Gordian
[05:43] knot and that's why I keep fading any
[05:45] attempts that they're that they're going
[05:47] to you know claiming that they're going
[05:48] to get back on track. I mean early this
[05:49] year and kind of late last year after
[05:51] the election there's this big idea that
[05:53] you know Doge and and Elon Musk are
[05:55] going to get this back on track and uh I
[05:57] was looking at the math and saying it's
[05:59] almost impossible. There's very little
[06:01] that they're going to be able to tackle
[06:03] u they actually get this back on track.
[06:04] the one uh demographics basically for
[06:07] decades um the baby boomer generation
[06:10] which is very big was paying into the
[06:12] system and now that they're effectively
[06:14] retired and increasingly retired a as
[06:17] the years go on as even the youngest
[06:18] baby boomers start to retire uh they're
[06:21] now in big draw down mode. Um, and so
[06:24] over the next 10 years, the existing 3
[06:26] trillion in the Social Security trust,
[06:28] which is held by intragovernment debt,
[06:30] it's kind of the wonky accounting that
[06:31] they do, but that's going to basically
[06:33] pour back into the economy and transfer
[06:35] to external debt. Um, and that's that's
[06:38] spendable income that enters the broader
[06:40] broader situ uh uh circulating economy.
[06:44] Uh, then there's interest expense. So
[06:45] for like you said, for 40 years we had
[06:48] rising debt to GDP but falling interest
[06:50] rates. Uh, and right around the same
[06:52] time the demographic started to roll
[06:54] over, um, we hit zero interest rates,
[06:56] bounced off zero, and now we have rising
[06:59] debt to GDP, but no longer declining
[07:01] interest rates. So, you don't even have
[07:03] to assume that interest rates are going
[07:04] to go up. If they just kind of chop
[07:05] around sideways for the foreseeable
[07:07] future, um, interest expense uh, starts
[07:09] becoming a very meaningful percent. They
[07:11] just passed defense. Uh, it's now like
[07:13] the biggest component after social
[07:15] security. Um, and if it keeps going,
[07:17] it'll eventually pass even social
[07:19] security. um defense spending as a
[07:22] percentage of GDP was falling for a
[07:24] while um as we kind of exited the cold
[07:26] war. Um but a lot of things the the kind
[07:29] of theme is things don't have to ramp up
[07:32] rapidly. Just if you have a mild trend
[07:34] change that can really matter. So if you
[07:35] go from shrinking military spending as a
[07:37] percentage of G just like flat or mildly
[07:39] up that's a trend change that that
[07:41] really makes a difference in some of
[07:42] these marginal numbers. Um uh and uh you
[07:46] know US has the highest healthare costs
[07:48] in the world. um on a per capita basis.
[07:51] Um and so that's a that's a whole topic
[07:54] in and of itself that that's very hard
[07:55] to unravel. So people often point to
[07:57] Japan, but Japan despite being on
[07:59] average 10 years older has much lower uh
[08:02] health care costs per capita. They live
[08:04] longer. Um a lot of factors there. Um
[08:08] but the United States has you know the
[08:09] other part of of retirement spending
[08:11] besides social security is the whole
[08:13] Medicare spending uh and and the broader
[08:15] healthcare industry. Uh and so basically
[08:17] for 10 plus years basically any sort of
[08:20] investment horizon that anyone complain
[08:22] around the deficits are virtually um
[08:25] unassalable. And then the kind of the
[08:28] the punchline which I didn't get to at
[08:29] the at the conference but I've written
[08:31] to before because it's it's a somewhat
[08:32] of a longer topic is that compared to
[08:35] many other developed countries like
[08:37] let's say Germany or Canada or whatever
[08:39] um the United States's tax receipts are
[08:41] more closely tied to its stock market
[08:44] performance. Um that's partially due to
[08:47] the fact that we're a global kind of hub
[08:49] for for equity capital that the whole
[08:51] world wants to invest in our equities.
[08:53] It's partially because we have higher
[08:54] wealth concentration than many other
[08:56] developed countries. And it's partially
[08:58] because of our nuances of our tax code.
[09:00] Um uh and so uh basically when you if
[09:04] they even even if they actually do a
[09:05] pretty good all attempt at austerity uh
[09:08] when you kind of fast forward 12 months
[09:10] or so uh it'll start it'll be like a
[09:13] recursive thing where now their tax
[09:14] receipts are suffering because of the
[09:15] way they structured things. And so
[09:18] nothing short of a kind of complete
[09:20] overhaul would even get close to
[09:21] tackling this and there's nothing on the
[09:23] cards for that politically.
[09:26] Yeah, it's um it seems very um
[09:29] convincing. One perhaps uh
[09:32] counterargument here would be well maybe
[09:34] interest rates can go down. I mean CPI
[09:37] has been uh relatively okay for the past
[09:40] couple of years. Uh it went up in 2020
[09:43] and 2021 during CO and uh then it came
[09:48] down. You know, they won the war against
[09:50] inflation as Paul Krugman says. So maybe
[09:54] they can bring interest rates down now
[09:56] and then that's going to uh reduce the
[09:59] debt burden and perhaps also serve as a
[10:03] growth stimulant so therefore increase
[10:06] tax revenues. What do you think? So I
[10:08] think it's possible and that's I mean
[10:10] when I you know I kind of at the
[10:12] conference my last slide was
[10:13] highlighting that they've been in a sit
[10:15] similar situation before which was the
[10:16] 1940s. Um and historically how they and
[10:19] other developed countries got out of
[10:20] this was financial oppression. they held
[10:22] interest rates low despite the fact that
[10:24] inflation was happening. Uh and then
[10:26] back then they also had very strong
[10:28] demographics and they had this this
[10:30] productivity boom both in the US and
[10:32] like Japan after the war there were
[10:34] multiple places that had a productivity
[10:35] boom and they were able to combination
[10:38] of grow out of the debt and inflate out
[10:40] of the debt even as the nominal debt
[10:42] never really went down and eventually
[10:44] started trending back up again. Yeah.
[10:46] Also, I I I should say like also uh one
[10:49] other factor in the 1940s is that they
[10:51] managed to find a very large number of
[10:53] bag holders for dollars after World War
[10:55] II. That's what what Breton Woods was
[10:58] about. All these countries shipped a lot
[10:59] of gold to the US and took paper from
[11:02] the US and that improved the fiscal
[11:05] situation of the US significantly. But
[11:07] yes, you're right. Yeah. Part that's
[11:09] part of the inflating away component.
[11:11] They basically that's the bag holder
[11:12] component and some of that was tricking
[11:14] people into be it and some of it is like
[11:16] forced like in America they they banned
[11:18] gold ownership which is crazy for like
[11:20] 40 years Americans could not own gold um
[11:23] and there were other things you just
[11:24] kind of stuffed um capital in places
[11:27] also banks uh an unusually high
[11:29] percentage of their assets were
[11:30] treasuries because they they were uh
[11:33] kind of forced into like these public
[11:35] utilities. They were basically there for
[11:37] holding treasuries for a period of time.
[11:39] that was kind of their that was like
[11:40] another offset. Um and so as we look
[11:43] forward, let's say they do cut interest
[11:45] rates, which is certainly possible. Um
[11:47] if we have for example um you know
[11:50] pretty rapid gains in in say AI keeping
[11:53] white collar wages not growing very
[11:56] quickly and kind of at a productivity
[11:57] boom from there and kind of the way that
[11:59] they choose to measure CPI is not
[12:01] particularly um going up very quickly
[12:03] which gives them levers to kind of cut
[12:05] interest rates. um that's certainly
[12:08] possible but then it just goes back to
[12:10] you know you still have the other
[12:12] component you still have the social
[12:13] security component you still have the uh
[12:15] Medicare component you still have the
[12:17] defense component uh you still have that
[12:19] whole complex interest rates are one of
[12:22] the key factors but then it goes back to
[12:24] also the prior point of it's a trend
[12:26] change so even if interest rates don't
[12:28] keep going up even if they don't stay at
[12:29] the level they are now and the important
[12:31] thing is they're not falling anymore
[12:33] even if interest rates go back down to
[12:34] say 2% on the short end and you know 4%
[12:37] on the long end or whatever the case may
[12:39] be. That's still not not an offset. It
[12:42] used to be an offset to the rising debt
[12:44] levels and now it's just kind of in the
[12:46] static range uh potentially. Uh and then
[12:48] in addition if you do get a much lower
[12:51] interest rate right now there's this
[12:53] kind of like um there's still a
[12:56] hawkishness behind the dollar. So
[12:58] there's a lot of developing countries
[12:59] out there that have dollar denominated
[13:02] debt. uh it's something like um $18
[13:05] trillion in dollar dominated debt I
[13:07] think of which 13 is like held by
[13:09] non-banks and the rest is held by banks
[13:12] um you know that's that's in developed
[13:14] countries that's in in emerging markets
[13:15] is kind of all blended that's part of
[13:17] the euro dollar system and all of that
[13:19] represents inflexible demand for dollars
[13:21] so when the dollar gets kind of strong
[13:22] it squeezes them if we do get a much
[13:25] lower interest rate on the dollar that
[13:27] allows a lot of those other countries to
[13:28] ease uh their monetary policies as well
[13:31] because they're not kind struggling
[13:32] against that strong dollar as much. You
[13:35] potentially get kind of a a bricks boom
[13:37] or like an emerging market boom cycle.
[13:39] Uh you potentially get higher energy
[13:41] prices from that right now because of
[13:43] the more sluggish global economy. It's
[13:45] it's one of the factors keeping oil
[13:46] prices um pretty much in line. Um and so
[13:50] that's another factor that that can kind
[13:52] of happen. And then uh at the conference
[13:54] I highlighted that you know gold and
[13:56] other scarce assets tend to have this
[13:58] inverse relationship to real rates
[14:00] historically which is you know if if US
[14:03] money supply is growing at 7 or 8% per
[14:05] year u most people aren't looking at
[14:07] that. They're looking at CPI uh but
[14:09] still it's growing at a pace. If if they
[14:11] feel like they're getting paid four or
[14:13] 5% they're more willing to hold on to
[14:15] that especially in this kind of
[14:16] regulated environment they they operate
[14:18] in. But if they're getting paid zero,
[14:20] one or 2% and that money supply is still
[14:22] growing, they're more likely to get into
[14:24] gold or in, you know, in our case,
[14:26] Bitcoin. Um, and so even if we get get
[14:29] this kind of low interest rate
[14:30] environment and deficits slow down a
[14:32] little bit, that's still really good for
[14:34] the assets uh that I'm talking about.
[14:36] And so that's kind of the the wonderland
[14:38] scenario we're in now. Whereas higher
[14:41] interest rates have one mechanism of
[14:43] accelerating this and lower interest
[14:45] rates have another mechanism of
[14:46] accelerating this. uh because it's kind
[14:49] of less of a free lunch now than there
[14:51] was during the structurally declining
[14:52] industry environment. The Bitcoin

[15:56] brought to you by the daylight computer.
[15:58] I love to work early in the morning and
[16:00] late at night or in the sun outdoors,
[16:02] but regular computer screens are
[16:03] terrible at these times and they strain
[16:05] your eyes. For years, I've wanted a
[16:07] paper-like electronic screen on a simple
[16:10] computer I could use to write. I tried
[16:12] several models, but none were very good.
[16:14] Now, finally, Daylight have delivered a
[16:18] fantastic full function tablet with a
[16:20] paper-like screen that's easy on your
[16:22] eyes and great for outdoor use. I've
[16:25] been using the Daylight computer to
[16:26] write my next book, and it is absolutely
[16:28] fantastic, and it has led me to invest
[16:31] in this company myself. Check out my
[16:33] interview with Anjan Kata in episode
[16:35] 249.
[16:40] Yeah. Yeah. It's difficult to see how
[16:42] you could um get um get these things to
[16:46] favorably align in a way that can avert
[16:49] this kind of problem. So the way out is
[16:52] in my opinion the way that I see it is
[16:55] default devaluation or default by
[16:58] devaluation some combination of these uh
[17:02] scenarios. Would you agree?
[17:06] Yeah, I agree. And in developed
[17:07] countries where the liabilities are in
[17:09] their own currency, it's almost always
[17:11] the devaluation option which and and I
[17:13] consider that a default as well.
[17:14] Basically, if you massively devalue bond
[17:17] holders on a purchasing power basis, um
[17:20] then that's a type of default. Uh and
[17:22] basically when you kind of kick, you
[17:24] know, we we've gone through this cycle
[17:25] where you keep building up private
[17:26] sector debt, then it gets so bad that
[17:28] they transfer a lot of it to the public
[17:29] sector. They kind of have this kind of
[17:31] rotation that happens. And when it's all
[17:33] in the public sector, there's really
[17:34] nowhere else for it to go other than
[17:36] default. And if you're an emerging
[17:38] market, you you often default nominally
[17:40] because you just can't acquire the
[17:42] dollars that you you pay back much like
[17:43] a private uh corporation. Whereas if
[17:45] you're the United States government, you
[17:46] print the difference. Um and depending
[17:50] on the level of
[17:51] productivity, that will affect how much
[17:53] bond holders even realize that because
[17:55] for example during the 1950s60s uh
[17:58] period, you know, bond holders weren't
[18:00] exactly complaining um and yet they were
[18:03] underperforming basically anything else.
[18:05] Uh so stock market was going up um you
[18:08] know most other asset prices were going
[18:10] up. Bond holders and currency holders
[18:12] were the bag holders. Um whereas in say
[18:16] the 70s or in the in the past five years
[18:18] when you have more um productivity
[18:20] challenges the bond holders feel it
[18:23] more. Uh and so it's not basically if it
[18:26] if there's bad productivity the bond
[18:27] holders can underperform even basic
[18:29] goods like energy prices for example. If
[18:32] there's really good productivity, they
[18:34] will still massly underperform mo like
[18:36] highquality financial assets that have
[18:38] scarcity to them. Things like gold,
[18:40] Bitcoin, art, um best highquality real
[18:44] estate. Um it it still kind of
[18:46] underperforms the things that we're not
[18:48] getting more productive in making. uh
[18:50] because there's that big spectrum in
[18:52] terms of things that are actually scarce
[18:53] versus things like electronics or
[18:56] textiles or whatever the case may be
[18:58] that that we're getting radically more
[18:59] productive in in making over time.
[19:04] Yeah.
[19:06] And do you think um do you think the
[19:10] well this was the topic of my dis my uh
[19:12] presentation on the in the conference
[19:14] which is on um demand for tether and I
[19:18] thought I I ran some numbers on what I
[19:20] think would be the fiscal impact of
[19:22] tether. So based on the research that
[19:26] you get on say uh QE generally um which
[19:31] is you know the most uh the topic that
[19:34] was the most studies they they have some
[19:37] estimates about how much you can move
[19:39] the yields with purchases and the answer
[19:46] then was when you know the debt was in
[19:49] the range of around 10 million sorry 10
[19:51] trillion then it was around 1 trillion
[19:53] ion of QE could move interest rates by
[19:57] about 2
[19:58] to.5. So that was about 10% of the debt.
[20:01] If you could QE 10% of the debt, then
[20:04] you could bring yields down 2
[20:07] to.5%. So I took that as a frame of
[20:09] reference and tried to project that on
[20:11] Tether. Now we have a lot obviously a
[20:14] bigger debt now. So you need a bigger
[20:17] purchase proportionately.
[20:19] So I projected you know I I took a
[20:22] higher end to try and uh overestimate
[20:25] the impact. I projected if we did one
[20:29] um one percentage point decline per 10
[20:32] percentage
[20:33] points of the
[20:36] debt what would be the impact and then I
[20:39] assumed that tether would be growing at
[20:42] around um 60% per year over the next 10
[20:45] years. So it gets to around $20
[20:48] trillion in
[20:51] 2035 which is huge. You know that's an
[20:54] enormous growth and I think it's quite
[20:57] unrealistic
[20:58] because there's a lot of dollar out
[21:01] there and a lot of tether's growth is
[21:02] going to be displacing some of the other
[21:04] dollar based instruments that are
[21:06] already out there. So it's not all new.
[21:08] But so if we did 20 trillion and then we
[21:13] uh you know if got to 20 trillion then I
[21:18] think in terms of the impact that it
[21:20] would have on the debt by 10 years
[21:23] time it would make about 3.7 trillion
[21:27] difference. So the debt would be instead
[21:31] of being about 69.5 trillion it would be
[21:34] 65.7. That's basically it. This is in
[21:38] this scenario where tether debt
[21:41] purchases grow
[21:43] enormously and they have a significant
[21:46] impact that they bring down yields by
[21:48] 1%. They'd reduce the cost of servicing
[21:51] the debt for sure, but the magnitudes
[21:55] involved are so
[21:56] enormous and the market for money
[21:59] outside of the US is already got so much
[22:02] dollars in it that I don't see even in
[22:06] the most optimistic growth scenarios,
[22:08] there's just not that much room for bag
[22:11] holders. It's not 1945 anymore where
[22:13] nobody had dollars outside of the US.
[22:16] Now everybody's swimming in dollars
[22:18] already. So yeah, they can always buy
[22:20] more dollars, sure, but it's not going
[22:23] to make as much of a difference as in
[22:24] 1946 when they were going from very
[22:28] little dollars abroad. Right. I agree
[22:31] with you. I So I don't think stable
[22:32] coins are a magic bullet. I I listened
[22:34] to your talk. Um I I think the the best
[22:37] point in the talk that that I heard was
[22:39] um that it displaces many other types of
[22:42] dollar holdings. It's not it's not all
[22:44] new. Now there's there's some new but
[22:46] it's it doesn't it doesn't it's not like
[22:48] all new because um right now existing
[22:51] currencies are partially backed by
[22:53] dollars treasuries uh and that sort of
[22:55] thing and to the extent that you um
[22:58] undermine that and and give people
[23:00] dollars a little bit more directly more
[23:01] more pegged um it it depletes that other
[23:04] one. Now it is pegged at a higher rate.
[23:06] So if for example let's say a given
[23:08] developed market currency uh let's say
[23:11] 20% of the money supply is backed by
[23:13] treasuries by the central bank um and
[23:16] instead those those marginal holders
[23:18] switch over to holding stable coins that
[23:20] are backed you know 80% by treasuries or
[23:23] whatever the case may be um that changes
[23:25] the ratio um and so basically what it
[23:28] does is it transfers seniorage from
[23:30] other central banks more to the US um uh
[23:33] so I view it less through the interest
[23:35] rate channels being effective because
[23:36] like you said I I don't think that it's
[23:38] going to like materially massively
[23:40] change industry around the margins it
[23:42] can that's not the big avenue I think
[23:44] the biggest avenue is that right now
[23:47] there's all these borders that kind of
[23:49] in some ways try to prevent people from
[23:51] getting dollars because there are a lot
[23:52] of people that um would like to have
[23:54] more dollars than they have now there's
[23:56] you know if if you think of the two ways
[23:58] to get currency in and out of a country
[24:00] one is physical borders which are
[24:02] obviously highly surveiled policed you
[24:04] can't easily bring large amounts through
[24:06] them. Uh, and you know, wire transfers
[24:09] and and even fintech stuff is is just,
[24:12] you know, basically an overlay on top of
[24:13] of you know, banks talking to each
[24:15] other. Um, and they can control that.
[24:17] They can control, you know, what the
[24:19] what the exchange rate is if you try to
[24:20] transfer dollars in. They can control
[24:22] whether or not, you know, the the the
[24:24] people that have access to banks can
[24:26] even get dollars. And what stable coins
[24:28] do is they kind of go around that
[24:30] because you know by memoring memorizing
[24:33] a few words or writing them down uh you
[24:36] have this this higher density of getting
[24:38] uh value in and out of a place either
[24:41] physically or or you know with a QR code
[24:44] over a video call. So it allows more
[24:46] access to dollars which um gives people
[24:49] in those countries more ability to get
[24:51] them that otherwise had frictions. Um
[24:54] but that's that's you know that's still
[24:56] got limits to it and the the whole world
[24:59] is kind of already pretty aggressively
[25:00] in US assets. Uh and then especially
[25:03] when we're talking big pools of capital
[25:05] a lot of them are in equities a lot of
[25:07] them are in bond markets a lot of them
[25:09] are in private equity in the US. Uh it's
[25:11] not really you know going against that
[25:13] market. It's mostly going against the
[25:14] the the smaller market which is
[25:16] basically currency uh and the the
[25:19] existing central bank senior. Um, so
[25:21] it's not that it makes no difference,
[25:24] uh, but that it's not some magic answer.
[25:26] And what we I think what we generally
[25:27] see is politicians, they like to point
[25:29] to magic answers when the math doesn't
[25:31] really work. It's like one of the magic
[25:33] answers historically was basically
[25:35] productivity growth. that sure this this
[25:38] bill that say cuts taxes and raises
[25:40] spending at the same time uh and sure
[25:43] the the projections that it's going to
[25:45] increase the deficit but they'll say
[25:46] well we'll we'll get so much
[25:48] productivity growth from this bill that
[25:50] the deficit will work itself out right
[25:52] and that that's one of the magic bullets
[25:54] they'll point to and this the stable
[25:56] coins are kind of the modern-day uh
[25:58] thing that some politicians I think
[25:59] point to to say well you know maybe the
[26:02] math doesn't work but if we pursue this
[26:04] we can at least kind of um make the
[26:06] runway go longer. Uh marginally increase
[26:08] the demand for dollars. Um and then by
[26:11] extension treasuries and just kind of
[26:13] it's mostly about that backing ratio
[26:15] shift to the extent that these are able
[26:16] to penetrate into those economies more
[26:19] than physical dollars uh have
[26:21] historically been able to. Yeah. And I
[26:23] think um a lot of it is competing
[26:26] directly with physical dollars. people
[26:29] who use dollars in developing countries,
[26:32] a lot of it used to be physical cash and
[26:34] now they're using USDT and then a lot of
[26:37] it is competing with
[26:39] um u financial uh instruments that are
[26:44] ultimately backed by dollars although at
[26:46] a much lower ratio but still at the end
[26:49] of the day you know the total M0 around
[26:52] the world is only about $15
[26:54] trillion that's total global M0 and the
[26:58] US dollar is only about half of that and
[27:00] then the other the rest of the M0
[27:04] um the rest of the world's monies you
[27:05] know the foreign reserves of the rest of
[27:07] the world are about 60 70% US dollar I
[27:10] think um last I checked it was in the
[27:12] 60s may have dropped recently but still
[27:15] about 60% of global currency reserves
[27:18] are in dollars so there's just not that
[27:21] much uh room for more and more bag
[27:25] holders to come and and I think you're
[27:26] right it's one of these Uh it's one of
[27:29] these uh ideas that just sounds very
[27:32] good when people are desperate to sell
[27:34] them this kind of
[27:35] uh just like you know with tariffs that
[27:38] foreigners are going to pay for
[27:39] everything. We can just uh put 140%
[27:42] tariff and then you know the producer
[27:43] will pay you triple the price of his
[27:46] product for the privilege of having you
[27:48] consume it. Um they'll just eat it right
[27:51] and then we'll have our cake and eat it
[27:53] too.
[27:55] Yeah. We've already seen the narrative
[27:56] shift there. I mean, a lot of those
[27:57] foreign producers, I mean, these these
[27:59] are not software companies, they're
[28:00] hardware companies. They have profit
[28:02] margins that might be 10, 20, 30%. Uh,
[28:05] they can't just absorb a double-digit
[28:07] tariff uh and just kind of take it. Um,
[28:10] and so we've already seen the narrative
[28:12] shift from foreigners are going to pay
[28:13] it to um, you know, politicians saying
[28:16] they're going to make sure that American
[28:17] companies are not raising prices to try
[28:19] to get them to absorb it. And it's like,
[28:20] well, why do we have to do that if the
[28:22] foreigners were going to absorb it? Um
[28:24] and and so yeah, the these things have
[28:26] real costs.
[28:27] Um politics is always about optics
[28:30] games. Um and I think the final point on
[28:33] stable coins is that it it's less I view
[28:36] it less about the number of getting the
[28:37] number of dollars out there. It's
[28:39] partially it it impairs in some ways the
[28:42] exchange rate between the dollar and
[28:43] other other currencies. And kind of the
[28:45] the the the thing that can happen, let's
[28:48] say you have this kind of country with a
[28:49] increasingly impaired currency. It's
[28:51] it's a developing country. It's got say
[28:53] 20% dollar backing for its currency.
[28:55] Early adopters that say previously had
[28:58] trouble getting into dollars due to
[29:00] border restrictions and other things and
[29:01] bank restrictions to the extent the
[29:03] stable coins allow them to get into
[29:06] dollars more uh more than than they
[29:08] previously could. Earlier adopters that
[29:10] do that benefit because as people get
[29:12] out of that local currency and get into
[29:15] a more backed version of the dollar, the
[29:17] other ones potentially are the the ones
[29:20] that are transferring purchasing power
[29:21] to the ones that got into to stable
[29:24] coins earlier. Now, the same is true for
[29:26] Bitcoin. The same is true for any other
[29:28] scarce asset. And it just so happens
[29:30] that currently the biggest two ones, bit
[29:31] Bitcoin and stable coins are ones that
[29:34] give more access to a lot of these
[29:36] countries than other that they
[29:37] previously didn't have. So, a lot of
[29:39] these countries, they they already had
[29:40] access to gold. Many cases, they often
[29:42] use local real estate as a kind of a
[29:45] placeholder for value. Um, something
[29:47] more scarce than the local currency. Um,
[29:50] and Bitcoin and stable coins mainly have
[29:53] the advantage that over a video call or
[29:55] a DM or even transferring value through
[29:58] borders, there's there's greater um
[30:01] density and and ease of access there.
[30:03] And so the the the biggest losers are
[30:05] the ones in those countries that don't
[30:07] transfer over to better monies once it
[30:09] becomes available for them to do so. The

[31:34] coins and not lose them. Go to the
[31:37] bitcoinway.com and start bitcoining more
[31:41] confidently. Yeah. And I think the same
[31:45] dynamic eventually um is going to apply
[31:48] on to Bitcoin. I think we're going to
[31:50] see probably uh a fight to the death
[31:53] between fiat currencies as they one by
[31:56] one continue to sink thanks to their uh
[32:00] inflationary and uh fiscal monetary
[32:03] policies. But uh eventually people are
[32:06] going to start realizing this. I think
[32:09] even though in the 20th century we had a
[32:11] lot of
[32:12] hyperinflations, I think for most people
[32:15] who suffered through these
[32:16] hyperinflations, it was never as
[32:18] transparent as say the current shitcoin
[32:22] market is in that you could just dig up
[32:26] charts very easily and very quickly
[32:28] online at any point in time and see
[32:30] exactly how much you're getting uh
[32:32] rugged. it was a lot more complicated.
[32:35] You know, historically,
[32:37] um, when people go through
[32:38] hyperinflation, generally there's just
[32:40] so much other stuff going on that for
[32:43] them it's uh the hyperinflation itself
[32:45] is almost always um in the background
[32:49] compared to, you know, the prime
[32:51] minister was assassinated or uh
[32:55] the a part of the country broke off or
[32:57] the civil war started or something like
[32:59] that.
[33:00] So they can't really um they they don't
[33:04] really identify the cause and effect
[33:07] between the inflationary monetary policy
[33:10] and the excessive
[33:11] spending by governments and the collapse
[33:14] in the currency. And for most people
[33:17] most of these periods their access to
[33:19] other currencies was relatively limited.
[33:22] There was their currency and then there
[33:23] was the other currency. And so for many
[33:24] of these people at often they think of
[33:28] it not so much as our currency
[33:31] collapsed. It's the dollar shot up you
[33:34] know something happened to the dollar
[33:37] where in our country out of all the
[33:39] world's countries for some reason it
[33:40] became very expensive. This is you'll be
[33:43] surprised but you know people still
[33:45] think of this uh in in these terms until
[33:48] today. But I think the more uh
[33:52] interconnected the world becomes and the
[33:54] more accessible these alternative
[33:56] currencies become, things like Bitcoin
[33:58] and stable coins, the more it becomes
[34:01] easier to just dig up a website and see
[34:06] the performance of one currency against
[34:07] another. And then you'll start really
[34:10] getting what's going on. you'll see that
[34:12] yeah that all these currencies are
[34:14] constantly getting devalued against the
[34:16] dollar and the dollar itself is getting
[34:19] devalued and I think more and more
[34:21] people are going to notice this just
[34:22] because it's going to become more and
[34:23] more obvious and more and more
[34:26] transparent because of you know internet
[34:29] and information and charts and people
[34:31] talking about it on social media all the
[34:34] time I agree yeah the last time that uh
[34:37] even if you go to developed countries
[34:38] last time they went through financial
[34:39] oppression was basically the the 40s and
[34:41] 50s era, information traveled way
[34:43] slower. Uh especially information
[34:46] between people like that wasn't from the
[34:48] top down big big sources. Uh information
[34:51] between people was much slower. Things
[34:53] like physical newsletters and magazines
[34:55] and stuff and now it's it's social
[34:56] media. Now it's websites. Uh and so all
[34:59] this information can flow around way
[35:01] quicker, including including across
[35:02] borders in most cases. Um, and so this
[35:05] is the financial oppression that we can
[35:06] meme about in real time that people
[35:09] couldn't do back in like the 40s. Um,
[35:12] and so while and and it's it's also the
[35:14] case where if you have like a long-term
[35:16] issue that causes something, people uh
[35:19] there's less things that like
[35:20] politicians can point to that are
[35:22] convincing to people. So, for example,
[35:24] in United States history, um the
[35:26] financial repression partially worked
[35:27] because they created this like we're all
[35:29] in this together environment, you know,
[35:31] like buy buy bonds to support, you know,
[35:33] this and we're we're fighting the Nazis
[35:35] and that that kind of environment.
[35:37] Whereas, if the if we're in the same
[35:39] debt situation we are now, uh as we were
[35:42] back then in terms of debt to GDP, but
[35:44] this time it's because of decades of
[35:45] mismanaged entitlement math and stuff
[35:48] like that and and uh foreign wars that
[35:51] trillions of dollars were spent on. and
[35:52] then there's there's no gain from it. Um
[35:55] that type of uh accumulated basically
[35:58] entropy in in the public ledger is way
[36:01] less easier to justify uh way less
[36:03] easier to distract people from. And so
[36:05] the combination of faster information
[36:08] and uh less uh acute reasons for how
[36:11] they got here um has has its effect.
[36:14] It's kind of like how during uh the
[36:16] initial inflation surge people were
[36:17] saying well this is a supply chain
[36:18] issue. Um but then when we kind of fast
[36:22] forward many years, the prices are still
[36:24] elevated. We're still above their
[36:26] inflation targets. Uh prices never go
[36:28] back down for the most part to where
[36:30] they were because it's inherently about
[36:32] the money supply growth, not about the
[36:33] supply chain issue, even though in in
[36:36] the near- term supply chain issues of
[36:37] course matter. Um and people start to
[36:39] notice that information moves quicker.
[36:41] Uh and now people um you know, they have
[36:44] more options to get out of the weakest
[36:46] things and into the strongest things.
[36:48] Yeah.
[36:50] And we know what the strongest thing is.
[36:53] Bitcoin. Exactly. There is no second
[36:56] best. And people are just going to
[36:58] realize it. I mean, there's no escaping
[37:00] it. The Bitcoiners are just not going
[37:02] away. They're going to keep imagining
[37:04] one day this Ponzi is going to crash.
[37:06] But it's not going to happen. It's not
[37:09] going to crash. It's just going to keep
[37:10] going up and eventually you're going to
[37:12] have to adjust your mental model and
[37:15] join the orange train.
[37:18] Yeah. It's um you know it's it's kind of
[37:20] like
[37:22] and I think there's the problem is that
[37:24] there's so many things that people kind
[37:26] of have to get like the hurdles they
[37:27] have to go through to get that one is
[37:29] like can digital things have lasting
[37:31] value that's one of the hurdles people
[37:33] get through another one is okay so if
[37:35] digital things can have value what
[37:37] prevents all of these from having value
[37:39] and and depleting the supply so then
[37:40] they have to kind of see why network
[37:42] effects and
[37:44] self-reinforcing salailability really
[37:46] matter um And then they have Yeah. So
[37:49] there's like a number of steps that
[37:50] people get through. Um I mean that's
[37:52] partially why we both do what we do is
[37:54] to kind of educate uh and share what we
[37:56] research along the way uh to to try to
[37:59] be part of this uh information trend. Um
[38:02] so a as information gets more you know
[38:05] easily out there um it still relies on
[38:08] people doing work doing research and
[38:10] sharing it with others uh to say here's
[38:12] here's what's happening. here's, you
[38:14] know, okay, here's here's arguments I'm
[38:16] seeing. Here's answers to those
[38:18] arguments. Um, and over time, people
[38:20] people get it. And another point that I
[38:22] made is like people can see one or two
[38:25] bubbles and dismiss them. So, if they
[38:27] see kind of Bitcoin rise and collapse,
[38:29] like, oh, the bubble's dead, they don't
[38:31] necessarily go look at the log chart and
[38:33] see that there's been a couple bubbles.
[38:35] They only can really often know the
[38:36] bubbles that they saw. And the first
[38:38] really public bubble was 2017. Uh then
[38:42] there's the whole second bubble, but
[38:43] then people kept like, well, that was
[38:44] that was COVID. That was, you know, that
[38:46] was the money printing thing. So we had
[38:47] we got this kind of second aftershock
[38:50] and people were able to dismiss that,
[38:51] but now it it came up a third time. So
[38:54] this is this is the third quote unquote
[38:56] bubble uh that have that has been in the
[38:59] kind of the public realm with the prior
[39:01] ones, the prior bull markets being kind
[39:03] of subpublic level. Uh and people can't
[39:06] really ignore things more than three
[39:08] times. I think that's kind of the magic
[39:10] number where it's not an accident. It's
[39:12] not a fluke. Uh maybe I should actually
[39:14] pay attention to this thing. Um that's
[39:17] certainly what happened to me just just
[39:19] forwarded a little bit. Like I would see
[39:21] um Bitcoin have a have a cycle uh one of
[39:24] its early cycles and say that's neat,
[39:26] you know, it's it's cool and then I kind
[39:28] of forget about it and then it has like
[39:29] another bigger cycle and I'm like oh
[39:31] that's actually still that's actually
[39:32] still here. And then it kind of goes
[39:33] through a bare market and it goes to the
[39:35] third third cycle. I'm like okay I'm not
[39:36] going to mess this one up. So, uh, I
[39:38] finally figured out and I think that
[39:41] that's that's the important thing is
[39:42] that that's now basically happening in
[39:44] the public realm. We now have three
[39:46] cycles that are all relatively public.
[39:49] Yeah. And it's been um it's been in u I
[39:53] mean there there were all kinds of
[39:55] financial instruments allowing people
[39:57] exposure to Bitcoin even as early as
[40:00] 2017. So, it's been on most people's
[40:03] tickers and Bloomberg terminals since
[40:07] 2017. And here we are, and this is the
[40:09] third pump. And um yeah, I think it's uh
[40:14] it's going to continue to get harder and
[40:16] harder to be a hater. Um but what what
[40:20] are your thoughts on all of this u
[40:22] tariff uh brewhaha that has been uh
[40:26] taking place? Um how do you see this
[40:28] unfolding?
[40:31] uh generally in things gradually backing
[40:34] down. uh it's been a big subject of my
[40:37] macro analysis cuz I I publish reports
[40:39] every two weeks for for clients kind of
[40:41] going you know what's happening what are
[40:43] the risks what are the opportunities uh
[40:45] and that has taken up kind of the the
[40:48] bulk of the macro section um just
[40:50] because um there are really boolean
[40:52] outcomes there um and like I I invest
[40:56] partially in private markets too and
[40:58] like there there are companies that are
[40:59] just frozen in indecision uh because
[41:02] they might have a Chinese supply chain
[41:04] And it's like, well, should we try to
[41:06] retool this and put it in the US and
[41:08] ironically lower the quality? Because
[41:10] they're like, we can't even find US
[41:12] manufacturers that make this uh the same
[41:14] way. Uh so we'd have to like simplify
[41:16] the product in a in a negative way. Um
[41:19] and it's more expensive. And imagine we
[41:22] do all that and then there's some sort
[41:24] of tariff change where the tariffs go
[41:25] away and it's like our competitor that
[41:27] didn't do that and just kept their
[41:28] Chinese supply chain is ahead because
[41:30] they didn't spend money retooling
[41:32] everything. um or if we sit down and do
[41:34] nothing, what if these things don't
[41:36] change? Uh and you know, basically our
[41:39] margins are wiped away and we're kind of
[41:41] operating at a very high level. So
[41:42] there's a lot of companies that are just
[41:45] they're their default is run more
[41:47] conservatively because we don't know
[41:49] what things look like 6 months from now
[41:51] in terms of margins, in terms of our
[41:53] ability to make long-term contracts with
[41:55] our suppliers. uh kind of like how
[41:57] inflation disrupts productivity because
[42:00] it it's hard to make contracts and you
[42:01] have to you have to make shorter term
[42:03] more conservative decisions with things.
[42:05] Um tariffs have essentially the same
[42:08] impact which is you it's harder to make
[42:11] long-term optimal decisions. So
[42:13] everything's shorter and and andor
[42:16] frozen. Um so yeah, I'm pretty negative
[42:18] on that. It's also, you know, people
[42:20] have often asked what can make Bitcoin
[42:23] and the NASDAQ kind of decouple because
[42:25] a lot of people say Bitcoin just like
[42:27] levered NASDAQ basically. They go up,
[42:29] they go up together, they go down
[42:30] together. I I would argue a lot of that
[42:32] has been due to the liquidity
[42:33] correlation. But one of the things that
[42:35] can make them decouple on a more
[42:37] persistent basis, like let's say you
[42:38] have a 5-year period where NASDAQ is
[42:40] chopping along sideways and Bitcoin is
[42:42] is up significantly, would be the margin
[42:45] impact on US corporations. Uh so if you
[42:48] do get kind of an environment where
[42:49] liquidity is pretty good due to
[42:51] monetized fiscal deficits or whatever
[42:53] the case may be um but you have impacted
[42:56] corporate margins that could certainly
[42:58] be an environment where non-corporate
[43:00] assets uh basically monies like Bitcoin
[43:03] or gold or in some cases foreign
[43:05] equities could have a cycle of pretty
[43:08] significant decoupling uh from some of
[43:11] the American counterpart equities uh
[43:13] because they're the ones kind of
[43:15] swimming in these tariffs. So I I view
[43:17] it as highly disruptive. Um one of the
[43:20] kind of the offsets to inflation over
[43:23] the past 30 40 years uh part of what
[43:26] fueled lower interest rates was
[43:28] globalization and globalization is in
[43:30] some ways more fragile but it's more
[43:32] productive. So as long as entities are
[43:35] not arguing with each other that's that
[43:36] tends to be a pretty productive way of
[43:38] doing things. There are winners and
[43:40] losers from that but but on average
[43:42] there are more winners than losers. Uh,
[43:44] and so this is like a trend change where
[43:46] I think we're entering a more
[43:47] protectionist environment. Um, even if
[43:49] some of this gets dialed back, I don't
[43:50] think it's going away entirely. And I
[43:52] think that certain kind of international
[43:54] relationships are are persistently
[43:56] changed now uh because some of these
[43:59] decisions and that again that's good for
[44:01] neutral reserve assets more so than
[44:04] assets that are entirely kind of belong
[44:05] to one country.
[44:08] Yeah. I mean on some level you look at
[44:10] it and you think this is what you would
[44:13] want to do if you wanted to undermine
[44:15] the dollar internationally if you wanted
[44:18] to make the world not use the dollar as
[44:21] the global reserve currency. But at the
[44:23] same time it's being combined with a
[44:25] rhetoric of we want to enforce the
[44:28] dollar, we want to continue to make sure
[44:30] that the world uses the dollar. We're
[44:33] going to stop other countries from
[44:34] switching away from the dollar. So it is
[44:37] uh pretty enigmatic and I've I've come
[44:42] to the uh pretty solid conclusion you
[44:46] know I I mean I could be persuaded
[44:47] otherwise but I'm pretty solidly
[44:50] convinced at this point that uh there is
[44:53] no uh genius um master plan u there is
[44:58] no 4D chess driving this. This is uh as
[45:02] ridiculous as it sounds. you know, you
[45:03] keep trying to think maybe u maybe
[45:07] there's some kind of uh clever play
[45:09] here, but no, I mean, it's just uh had
[45:12] this had the tariffs actually gone
[45:14] through, it would have been massively
[45:15] devastating. Um the fact that they're
[45:18] still hanging there, I mean, I shouldn't
[45:20] say massively devastating, you know, it
[45:22] wouldn't have been as bad as co it would
[45:25] have uh it would have been expensive. It
[45:28] would have cost a lot of people their
[45:29] jobs and ruined their livelihood and
[45:33] raised prices a bit here and there but
[45:34] it wouldn't have been something as bad
[45:36] as co but uh um it's it's not something
[45:40] that is good and I think this kind of um
[45:43] this kind of idea that you can just play
[45:45] with markets and you know crash stocks
[45:49] to prop up bonds and then lower the
[45:52] borrowing costs for the government.
[45:55] This is the stuff of third world banana
[45:58] republic finance ministers and their
[46:02] creative ideas which sound amazing for
[46:04] the first six months before you know
[46:07] they have to flee the Ministry of
[46:10] Finance by
[46:11] helicopter and then catch a private jet
[46:14] somewhere where they can access their
[46:16] Swiss bank accounts. It's one of these
[46:19] it's it's one of these things where
[46:20] people just start thinking too much of
[46:24] the macroeconomy as if it was a private
[46:26] business and thinking of it like a CEO
[46:29] can turn around a company and it's just
[46:31] it's not you're I think the ultimate
[46:34] problem is the from my perspective it's
[46:36] it's from the Austrian perspective it's
[46:39] that
[46:41] the issue of economic calculation can
[46:44] only be done with private property and
[46:46] so The government is in no position to
[46:48] be negotiating on behalf of
[46:51] others who own their own capital. So if
[46:54] the government is deciding for your
[46:55] business that you're going to start
[46:57] paying 140% import tariff on goods from
[47:00] China, they're not performing that
[47:02] calculation from the from the
[47:04] perspective of somebody who's managing
[47:06] your business because they don't own
[47:08] your business. And the notion that they
[47:11] can just make these plans for everybody,
[47:13] I think is highly highly damaging. It
[47:16] might make I I can see how it would
[47:18] appeal to somebody who works as a CEO to
[47:20] think that you could negotiate on behalf
[47:22] of the entire country and then
[47:25] strengthen the negotiating position of
[47:26] everybody in the country. But in
[47:28] reality, it's millions of people
[47:30] negotiating with millions of foreigners
[47:33] and you're not helping by just uh coming
[47:37] in and
[47:39] u scrapping everything that they've
[47:41] agreed to and throwing it in the garbage
[47:43] bin and telling them let's start all
[47:45] over again. I agree. Uh it's been
[47:48] interesting to watch. I mean basically I
[47:49] I was from the beginning I was fading
[47:51] this view but there was this kind of
[47:53] honeymoon period where they kind you
[47:54] know there are a lot of people that are
[47:55] like no maybe they will reduce the
[47:57] deficits or maybe maybe this trade thing
[47:58] will uh you know work out. Um uh uh but
[48:03] I you know I'm embarrassed on that
[48:04] you've been bearish on that concept that
[48:05] it that it's going to be effective. Um
[48:08] if you look at the interesting thing is
[48:10] any administration there's kind of
[48:11] multiple voices within administration
[48:12] like multiple camps that are all trying
[48:14] to basically get the the administration
[48:17] to go in their direction versus the
[48:18] other one. Um the classic example of
[48:20] like a king and then his advisers around
[48:22] him kind of pulling him in one way or
[48:23] another. uh and uh in this
[48:25] administration there's the the the side
[48:28] that kind of laid this out the most
[48:29] articulately if you were to see if
[48:31] there's an attempt at a master plan they
[48:33] kind of spelled out ahead of time which
[48:34] was like basically Steven
[48:37] um uh that's that's Trump's uh chair of
[48:39] the Council of Economic Adviserss they
[48:42] kind of they they he published an
[48:43] academic uh type of paper uh in November
[48:46] 2024 so after after Trump was elected
[48:49] and it kind of said if we were to reset
[48:51] global trade here how would we do it uh
[48:54] and what are the risks associated with
[48:55] it doing it? So, it wasn't like this
[48:57] kind of
[48:57] um political piece. It was kind of this
[49:00] like more more analysis type piece and
[49:02] and it was kind of the steel man version
[49:04] of what they're trying to do. And I
[49:06] think that the the the critique I would
[49:08] give of that paper having read it is
[49:10] that it it kind of made too many
[49:12] generous assumptions about the US's uh
[49:15] leveraging like position in terms of the
[49:17] leverage that they have in these
[49:19] negotiations. The view was, okay, we
[49:21] ramp up tariffs, that'll squeeze many of
[49:23] our, um, trade partners, it'll
[49:25] strengthen the dollar, uh, and then
[49:28] we'll be able to, uh, make trade deals
[49:30] with them that are more favorable to the
[49:32] US than they are now. That was that was
[49:34] like kind of their literally their
[49:36] written plan. Um, and then there are
[49:38] other parts of that paper, too, that
[49:40] were relevant. uh and they kind of said
[49:42] okay well after that kind of first wave
[49:45] of hard negotiation once we do make
[49:46] these trade deals then maybe we can do
[49:49] some sort of like Mara Lago accord to
[49:52] purposely weaken the dollar compared to
[49:53] other major currencies that can allow
[49:55] kind of a global trade boom that can
[49:58] reduce US uh trade deficits uh and they
[50:01] were like okay but here's the problem is
[50:03] that that can be inflationary uh for
[50:05] things in dollar terms um and it can
[50:08] result in higher bond yields so how do
[50:09] we offset that they were like, well, as
[50:11] part of our negotiations, we can try to
[50:13] get foreign countries to uh term out
[50:16] their debt, basically get them to it's
[50:18] basically an analysis of how we can get
[50:19] more bag holders. Um, and they I think
[50:22] they they they overestimated how much
[50:25] bag holders they'd get. They they seem
[50:27] to assume that that a lot of countries
[50:28] would agree to be bag holders um in
[50:31] exchange for one being under the the US
[50:33] military uh umbrella uh and two being
[50:37] able to access the the lucrative
[50:38] American market. I think they
[50:40] overestimated the value of those two
[50:43] things to a lot of especially the major
[50:46] bricks countries. You know, it's easy to
[50:48] push around a country that's got say 50%
[50:50] of his trade with the US and it's like
[50:52] 1% of US GDP. Uh they kind of assume
[50:55] that they have that type of negotiation
[50:57] position with the world. Whereas when
[50:59] you look at the China's, the Brazil's,
[51:01] the Indas, um big uh blocks of of
[51:05] countries that that have a lot of trade
[51:07] uh ties. Um I think they overplayed
[51:09] their hand. Uh and so that's kind of I
[51:11] think the steelman attempt of what they
[51:13] were trying to do. But then even with
[51:15] there are other other parts that were
[51:17] either disagreeing with that or
[51:18] modifying that and the result is is
[51:22] messy.
[51:24] Yeah. No, I agree entirely. I think um
[51:28] driving this is a misconception about
[51:31] the size of the US economy and the size
[51:34] of the Chinese economy. I think um
[51:37] there's still this conception of China
[51:39] as being China in
[51:41] 1995. And I think you know a lot of the
[51:44] um a lot of the rhetoric around China is
[51:46] that it is this totalitarian hell hole
[51:49] that is going to collapse. But
[51:51] ultimately, I mean, look around you. The
[51:55] majority of the most advanced goods in
[51:58] the world are being produced in China.
[52:01] And that's just not something that
[52:03] happens in a uh massively dysfunctional
[52:08] uh society that is on the verge of
[52:10] breakdown. it's not really possible to
[52:13] be at the forefront of technology while
[52:15] also being
[52:17] uh completely uh as weak as I think a
[52:22] lot of these Americans um imagine and at
[52:25] this point even for China I mean the
[52:27] volume of trade that China has with
[52:30] Southeast Asian countries the ASEAN
[52:32] countries which is 10 countries uh with
[52:35] a population of about 700 million people
[52:37] and a significant economy I mean 700
[52:40] million people Their economy is roughly
[52:42] the size of the EU or maybe a little bit
[52:44] larger now. So this is a huge trading
[52:49] block for China. You know, it contains
[52:51] Vietnam and Thailand and Malaysia and
[52:53] Indonesia and the Philippines. And so
[52:57] this is a huge trading block for China.
[52:59] An enormous amount of goods there. And
[53:02] China also trades with Latin America and
[53:04] with Africa. And the US is just about 12
[53:07] 13% of Chinese exports. I mean yes it is
[53:11] the biggest export but if you add up all
[53:13] the ASEAN countries together and it is
[53:15] one free trade zone which I think China
[53:18] negotiates with
[53:19] collectively it's about the same size
[53:22] and 13% is yeah it's not nothing but
[53:25] it's not everything it's it's it's
[53:27] perfectly possible for people to recover
[53:29] from losing 13% of their customer base.
[53:32] um drop your prices a little bit and
[53:35] there'll be plenty of people all over
[53:36] the world who will pick up the uh
[53:39] Americans
[53:40] leftovers. But uh I don't think it'll
[53:43] come to that. I think uh it's far too
[53:45] beneficial for Americans and for Chinese
[53:47] to trade with one another. It's just
[53:50] economic suicide. I mean, it's not
[53:52] suicide. I don't think it'll be
[53:53] catastrophic. I still think nature and
[53:55] markets will find a way. People will
[53:57] smuggle those things. They'll assemble
[53:59] them in Mexico and say that they're made
[54:01] in Mexico and they'll they'll find
[54:04] complicated treaties where, you know,
[54:05] Mexico has a free trade treaty with
[54:07] Thailand and Thailand imports it from
[54:09] China and then Thailand sends it to
[54:12] Mexico and then from Mexico to the US or
[54:13] whatever. They'll nature will find a way
[54:17] to route around those things. It'll be
[54:19] expensive, annoying, and destructive.
[54:23] But uh I I
[54:28] I'm optimistic it won't get too bad. I
[54:30] think they may have learned their
[54:31] lesson.
[54:33] Yeah, I think there there are several
[54:34] parts about China that are often
[54:36] underestimated. Uh because you know
[54:37] there are there are obviously headline
[54:39] things that are critiquable. Um their
[54:41] demographics issue, their real estate
[54:43] bubble and and leverage that was
[54:44] attached to that. Um but then the other
[54:47] factors keep being either misunderstood
[54:49] or just ignore completely. Like one um
[54:53] they're they're by far the biggest
[54:54] electricity producer in the world. um
[54:56] which is relevant for a lot of
[54:58] manufacturing uh and other types of of
[55:00] energy production like this the raw heat
[55:02] needed to make heavy industry like steel
[55:05] um and uh you know you can't just like
[55:08] magically teleport all that
[55:09] infrastructure to other countries or to
[55:11] the US that that that takes many many
[55:13] years to to to move even if there are
[55:16] economic shifts that happen to to that
[55:18] incentivize the movement of that so
[55:20] that's an incredibly valuable asset that
[55:21] they have that that industrial base the
[55:24] energy plus uh the manufacture action
[55:26] capabilities. There's also human
[55:28] capital. Um, so there are certain hubs
[55:30] that are good at things. Um, like say in
[55:32] Silicon Valley, you have the, you know,
[55:35] the the VC environment and then networks
[55:37] of funders that are they're fully ready
[55:39] to fund them. Um, there's all this
[55:41] connective uh tissue there. Same thing
[55:43] in New York with with uh investment
[55:44] finance. Um, uh, parts of China have
[55:47] really strong manufacturing hubs.
[55:49] They're people that know they're they're
[55:50] like masters at supply chains. uh they
[55:53] know all the all the all the connective
[55:54] tissues that's there. Um and they know
[55:56] all the suppliers. Uh it's just one big
[55:59] very efficient hub and that's hard to to
[56:02] move quickly and replicate elsewhere.
[56:04] And then they have people that are just
[56:05] have have years and decades of
[56:07] experience of of running manufacturing
[56:09] facilities uh and all the human capital
[56:11] that comes with that. Um and then
[56:14] China's been moving up the capital
[56:15] stack. So like you said, it's not China
[56:17] of the 90s or the 2000s anymore. It's
[56:19] not the market of plastic toys. Um, they
[56:22] moved up the capital stack. So now China
[56:25] is the biggest auto exporter in the
[56:26] world. Uh, literally in a four-year
[56:29] period from like 2020 to 2024. They
[56:32] leapfrogged all the major um exporters.
[56:34] They leaprogged South Korea, uh, the
[56:36] United States, uh, Germany, and now
[56:39] Japan to be the world's biggest uh, auto
[56:41] exporter. Uh, and that was kind of years
[56:44] in the making. Like a lot of things had
[56:45] to come together. Um, but now they are.
[56:48] Now they're the biggest auto exporter.
[56:49] Uh and it's mostly we don't we don't see
[56:51] those cars in the US. They're almost
[56:52] entirely uh to other countries. Um and
[56:57] uh if we kind of extend that longer, I I
[57:00] think that that could happen with
[57:01] aircraft as well. Uh I think Boeing and
[57:03] Airbus could eventually get um
[57:05] competition from Comarmac. Uh you get
[57:07] the ABCs of competition. And the
[57:09] timeline there is I think they started
[57:11] it and this is all from memory so it
[57:13] could be a year or two off, but they
[57:14] started it in 2008.
[57:16] um you know in the in the like 10 years
[57:19] later or so they were finally doing
[57:21] their first test flight. Uh then uh I
[57:24] think it was 2023 or so they were doing
[57:26] their first like inflight like actually
[57:28] like um deliveries of air of aircraft.
[57:31] Uh and you know give that another five
[57:32] or 10 years. Um that's another sector
[57:36] that a big industrial sector that
[57:38] they're in competition with especially
[57:39] given the problems we've seen in Boeing
[57:41] o over recent years. Um, so I think
[57:43] they're going to continue to move up the
[57:45] capital stack and China's got this like
[57:48] hybrid model where they do make certain
[57:51] top- down decisions. So for example,
[57:53] when um when the US tariff them uh in
[57:56] Trump's first term and when the Biden
[57:58] administration kept a lot of those kind
[58:00] of protections in place, uh China had
[58:03] some top- down decisions that basically
[58:04] was, okay, let's let's divert bubble
[58:07] activity from the real estate sector. uh
[58:09] basically telling banks, look, stop
[58:11] making loans to them. Start making more
[58:13] loans to these other say 10 industries
[58:16] we want to be more self-sufficient at.
[58:18] Uh and that's that's this like top- down
[58:20] funding decision of where credit's being
[58:22] allocated. But then at the level below
[58:24] that, there's like this battle royale
[58:26] free-for-all of competition to see which
[58:28] companies are going to make the best
[58:29] products with those that credit that's
[58:32] been available to that industry. So
[58:33] there is competition between say car
[58:35] manufacturers there even though it's a
[58:37] top- down decision to say make more
[58:40] credit available to the car making
[58:42] industry. Uh and so you at the end of
[58:44] the day you still get that layer of
[58:45] competition that happens. It's just the
[58:47] competition's at a somewhat different
[58:49] level. Yeah, I think it's um it's it's
[58:54] important for people to update their
[58:55] models about what's happening in China.
[58:56] I think cars are a great example because
[58:59] I remember 20 years ago, 15 years ago,
[59:02] um, Chinese cars were the butt of jokes.
[59:05] They were um, they were small, they were
[59:07] tiny, and they even used to make
[59:09] knockoff cars. I remember reading an
[59:10] article in The Economist, and this was
[59:13] so long ago. I used to read The
[59:15] Economist. Um, but they were talking
[59:18] about an entire industry of fake BMWs
[59:21] and Mercedes being made uh, in China.
[59:24] But now a lot of people who have been in
[59:27] Chinese in the new Chinese car tell you
[59:29] that they're so much better than uh than
[59:32] um German and American cars. Electric
[59:36] cars in particular, many people say
[59:38] Chinese ones are much cheaper and much
[59:39] better than Tesla. And in terms of, you
[59:43] know, you see these sort of stability on
[59:45] the road tests, um some of these videos
[59:49] show you that they're ahead of the
[59:51] German cars and some of these things. So
[59:54] it's um you know and the the phone that
[59:57] you're using, the laptop that you're
[59:58] using, a lot of the components that go
[60:00] into it as well. A lot of that is coming
[60:03] from China these days. And most of the
[60:07] most advanced goods in the world have
[60:10] some part of them being produced in
[60:11] China. It's not 1995 anymore. It's a
[60:15] very different world. And I think the
[60:16] world needs China as a trading partner a
[60:19] lot more than it needs the US. You know,
[60:22] China's main imports from the US are
[60:24] soy, corn, and beef. There aren't many
[60:27] other countries that can make soy, corn,
[60:29] and beef. Um, China's main exports are
[60:33] electronics. And these things are much
[60:35] more difficult to make.
[60:37] I agree. I agree. And I see it every
[60:41] every year when I go to Egypt, I see a
[60:43] higher ratio of Chinese cars on the
[60:45] road. Uh I I think some some extent this
[60:47] is also just Americans on average don't
[60:50] travel uh the world as much as maybe
[60:52] they should. Um and they kind of have we
[60:55] kind of had the luxury of existing in a
[60:56] bubble. Um whereas uh many other many
[61:00] other people in the world have to think
[61:01] about the dollar whereas Americans don't
[61:02] have to think about their currency. We
[61:04] we kind of have this bubble. Uh when you
[61:06] travel outside of it you see it more
[61:08] directly. So you see directly Chinese
[61:10] cars taking market share. So in addition
[61:12] to me as a macro analyst seeing this on
[61:13] a chart, I can actually go there and and
[61:16] see what's happening on the ground. And
[61:17] it's going through a similar dynamic
[61:18] that that South Korea went through uh
[61:21] and and like Hyundai uh where they enter
[61:24] the market and they say, "Okay, we're
[61:26] not the best quality, but we're cheap
[61:27] and we're good enough now." Uh and that
[61:30] starts to that matters for the for the
[61:31] lower-end market that that demands cars.
[61:34] In a lot of these countries, uh people
[61:36] still drive motorcycles and and other
[61:38] smaller vehicles. And when a vehicle can
[61:40] come along and be $15,000 or whatever
[61:43] the case may be and be pretty high
[61:44] quality, that's an entry point that
[61:46] people can get into the the auto market
[61:48] for the first time. Uh and it can and it
[61:51] can it can, you know, compete there. Uh
[61:53] and then when you're when you get better
[61:55] at that market for 5 years or 10 years
[61:57] or more, you can move up the quality
[61:59] spectrum to the mid-level and then
[62:01] sometimes the high level. Um, so
[62:02] Japanese automakers did it, South Korean
[62:05] automakers did it. Uh, and now Chinese
[62:07] automakers are are pretty well along.
[62:09] Uh, and in terms of sheer numbers,
[62:11] they're already number one. Um, and I
[62:13] think they can over time take more and
[62:14] more of the high-end as well. Um,
[62:17] they're competing in in industrial
[62:19] equipment, so excavation equipment, um,
[62:22] train technology, uh, and like I said,
[62:25] uh, aircraft technology. Um, and and so
[62:28] I I think that, yeah, they're going to
[62:29] continue to be a force to reckon with.
[62:31] um despite any demographics challenges
[62:34] they have and despite you know other
[62:37] issues they're a big force and and you
[62:39] mentioned uh Azan so association of
[62:42] Southeast Asian nations uh I covered
[62:45] that in a recent report too which is
[62:46] they basically had this announcement it
[62:48] was it was them plus three so plus China
[62:51] uh Japan and South Korea that are not
[62:53] part of that but that are associated
[62:54] with it um they basically got together
[62:57] and said we're a giant trade block still
[62:59] we're reiterating it in the world of
[63:01] tariffs. Uh, and if anything, we're
[63:03] leaning into it more. Um, and that's
[63:06] that's relevant. That's a huge share of
[63:08] the global economy. Uh, and then there's
[63:10] other, you know, there's the Shanghai
[63:12] um, uh, cooperation organization.
[63:14] There's BRICS plus um, there's all these
[63:16] international associations for all these
[63:18] other trade networks to kind of work
[63:21] together to say, okay, well, you have
[63:23] food and energy, we have technology,
[63:24] let's make sure our our trade links are
[63:26] open. Um, and so yeah, I think the US is
[63:30] in a weaker position going into this
[63:32] than, uh, some of the, you know, the the
[63:35] the hawkish takes were. Uh, and and
[63:38] there's always a disadvantage when you
[63:39] when, you know, it's better to like
[63:42] sometimes I'll say this and people are
[63:44] like, aren't you pro America? Like,
[63:45] shouldn't you? And it's like, well, even
[63:47] yes, I'm pro America, but part of being
[63:49] pro America is like understanding the
[63:52] other side properly. The worst thing you
[63:53] can do is underestimate a so-called
[63:55] opponent. Um, now whether they're even
[63:57] opponents is another like matter, but
[64:00] let's say they are. That's that's even
[64:02] worse than underestimating them is
[64:04] thinking they're an opponent when
[64:05] they're not. When they're not. Yeah. And
[64:06] then two, it's like, okay, let's take
[64:07] their framing and say they are. Well,
[64:09] the first step you do is don't don't
[64:11] underestimate them. Know all their
[64:12] strengths and then see if your plans
[64:14] still make sense. So that's that's the
[64:17] world. Yeah. I mean, there's this uh
[64:20] extremely compelling meme that keeps
[64:22] doing the rounds um of U Chinese Premier
[64:26] Gi Jinp
[64:27] uh sitting there and the meme says does
[64:30] nothing wins and it seems to be playing
[64:33] out at this point. They really don't
[64:35] have to do anything. Um the US is just
[64:39] uh it seems to be adamant uh on shooting
[64:43] itself in the foot and into pretending
[64:45] that it is in some kind of giant fight
[64:47] with China when China um is just out
[64:51] there trading. Um they're not
[64:55] they're they're really being a lot more
[64:58] cooperative internationally than the US.
[65:00] I mean they haven't fired a bullet
[65:02] abroad in 40 years.
[65:05] They've not intervened militarily
[65:08] anywhere. And the US on the other hand
[65:10] has just been fighting war after war
[65:12] after war all over the world and somehow
[65:17] is trying to now convince itself in the
[65:19] world that uh China is a massive threat
[65:22] to it like all the other threats.
[65:26] Yeah. And I think um it's funny cuz that
[65:28] that do nothing meme uh I think that one
[65:31] of the advantages of planning ahead is
[65:33] that by doing things early it makes it
[65:35] seem like you're doing nothing later. So
[65:37] they they did have a flurry of decisions
[65:39] they made back you know nearly a decade
[65:42] ago. Now when the US got increasingly
[65:44] protectionist against them the first
[65:45] time they basically did an analysis and
[65:48] said where where are we vulnerable?
[65:50] Let's invest heavily in those areas for
[65:51] the next x years. Uh and they did pretty
[65:54] aggressively. And so as we then
[65:56] accelerate the protectionism, they've
[65:58] got the the fruits of prior investments
[66:01] now, you know, that they they said,
[66:03] "Okay, well, if we get cut off from key
[66:05] semiconductors, uh to what extent can we
[66:07] replicate them here? If we get cut off
[66:09] from uh you know, XYZ and and how can we
[66:13] make them here and just shoring up
[66:15] defenses as much as possible to avoid
[66:17] kind of asymmetric issues?" Uh and so
[66:19] because they did a lot of that, now it's
[66:21] able to look like they're they're not
[66:22] doing much because at the current time
[66:24] they're not. they're just kind of
[66:25] reestablishing their existing um
[66:28] communications.
[66:29] So yeah, I think we're in a different
[66:31] world than we were 10 years ago, 20
[66:33] years ago. Um and trade is going to keep
[66:37] flowing. Uh and the US can kind of
[66:39] choose how much frictions it builds
[66:41] around itself. Um and and and part of it
[66:45] I think is education because people can
[66:47] you know if a lot of people get
[66:48] convinced of something then it can go in
[66:51] that direction even if it doesn't make
[66:52] sense. Um, and and so one thing I try to
[66:55] do is just my little part of just
[66:57] putting out research is say, "Hey, you
[66:59] know, here here's how I see things." Um,
[67:02] consider this before you get rallied up
[67:03] on something.
[67:05] Um, you know, to to to the extent that
[67:08] one person can can impact anything.
[67:11] Well, that's also why I do it as well.
[67:14] So, I guess there's more than one of us
[67:17] out there. I mean hopefully yeah
[67:19] ultimately
[67:21] uh stressing about all of these things
[67:23] is nowhere near as productive as just
[67:26] getting into Bitcoin joining the orange
[67:29] revolution stacking SAS and building the
[67:33] new world that you want and I think this
[67:35] is uh ultimately what's going to make a
[67:37] difference in the world. I agree and
[67:40] it's open source so people can jump in
[67:42] and build uh without permission in most
[67:44] cases. Um, so basically that we we've
[67:47] exist in a world of kind of centralized
[67:48] money. We need permission to even build
[67:51] on top of it. Uh, and now we have open-
[67:53] source money that people can
[67:55] permissionlessly build on. Uh, and if
[67:57] their jurisdiction doesn't let them, in
[67:59] many cases, they can move to another
[68:01] jurisdiction and build on it. Uh, and
[68:03] we've got these really strong building
[68:04] blocks to to route around a lot of these
[68:07] frictions.
[68:09] Absolutely. All right. Well, Lyn, I want
[68:11] to thank you so much for your time and
[68:14] insight. Always a pleasure. Thank you so
[68:16] much for joining us. Thanks for having
[68:18] me back on. All right. Take care.
