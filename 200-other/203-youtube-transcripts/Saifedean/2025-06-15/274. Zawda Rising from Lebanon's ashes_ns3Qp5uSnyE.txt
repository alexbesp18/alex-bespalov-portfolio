[00:05] Hello, welcome to the Bitcoin Statup
[00:06] podcast. Our guest today is Odai Kamal.
[00:08] Odai is the founder of Zoda, a Bitcoin
[00:11] startup for the Middle East region that
[00:13] offers collaborative custody and
[00:15] Bitcoinbacked loans. Zoda is part of the
[00:18] first cohort of the Bitcoin focused Wolf
[00:20] Accelerator and received additional
[00:21] backing from Axium Capital. Ardai
[00:24] started Zoda from his own ordeal in 2019
[00:27] when the Lebanese banking crisis hit and
[00:30] capital controls uh hit as well and they
[00:34] lost something like 75% of his life
[00:36] savings forcing him to start thinking
[00:38] about Bitcoin seriously. So I thought it
[00:40] would be a great idea to host day and
[00:42] see how out of this uh out of the fire
[00:46] of the Lebanese catastrophe emerged the
[00:49] phoenix of his startup day. Thank you
[00:53] for joining us. Good to be here safe and
[00:56] good to see you.
[00:58] Likewise. So I guess let's uh before we
[01:00] discuss the details of Zelda, let's
[01:02] begin with the backstory. Tell us about
[01:05] how fiat u ruined you and how you got
[01:09] radicalized into this
[01:11] uh bitcoin world. Uh right. So uh I had
[01:16] known about bitcoin for since 2012. My
[01:19] uh flatmate in grad school was somebody
[01:22] called Johnny Leaven. He's now the CEO
[01:24] of Ch analysis. But I remember very
[01:27] distinctly when we were joining kind of
[01:30] grad school. He had told me that he was
[01:32] working on a thesis for something called
[01:34] like this digital money thing. That's
[01:36] October 2012 and just didn't even think
[01:39] twice about it. Uh that was the very
[01:42] first time I heard about Bitcoin. And
[01:44] then over the years different topics and
[01:46] through the cycles I heard about it. But
[01:48] it wasn't until 2019 when the experience
[01:53] that I went through in Lebanon, which I
[01:55] can unpack, that's where I really had to
[01:57] ask myself like what does it take for
[01:59] you to not only preserve your wealth,
[02:01] but to become this sovereign individual
[02:02] that can uh control money, that can
[02:05] preserve the value of your money, that
[02:07] can transport it across uh both time and
[02:09] space. Uh, and it was really about three
[02:13] or four months after the crisis in
[02:14] Lebanon happened in October 2019 that I
[02:17] decided to withdraw whatever I could at
[02:19] the time and deployed it into Bitcoin
[02:22] because the stock market for me just
[02:24] stopped to make sense with all the
[02:27] capital that was coming in. So, it felt
[02:28] and that's that was my initial kind of
[02:30] like investment into it and I started
[02:31] dollar cost averaging every day during
[02:34] that was when in 2019.
[02:38] Yeah, October 2019 was when the crisis
[02:41] in Lebanon happened. U later that month
[02:43] like we couldn't like the banks were
[02:45] closed. There was protest on the
[02:46] streets. Uh people were trying to like
[02:49] there was a there's there was a run on
[02:50] the banks like you'd sit down. I had
[02:52] just moved to Egypt. Uh I had just been
[02:54] married. But my parents uh like my
[02:57] extended family would just go and sit in
[02:59] long lines waiting to withdraw $200 from
[03:01] their account. That was the allowed cap.
[03:04] At the same time, and we're finding out
[03:05] more now, you had this controlling class
[03:08] of the banks that were wiring all this
[03:09] money abroad about something like nine
[03:12] billion dollars that just like left the
[03:14] system uh during that period. So, it was
[03:16] a very interesting contrast. We were
[03:17] seeing it while the uprising was
[03:19] happening. And as I did all all these
[03:21] trips up until COVID hit in March,
[03:23] Lebanon, uh I would just go and sit and
[03:26] try to withdraw as much money as I
[03:28] could. And for me, like even like the
[03:30] small amount that we take, you'd had
[03:32] exchanges convert it to SDT, put it on
[03:34] Binance, and buy Bitcoin with it. But
[03:35] how how much could you get out at that
[03:37] point?
[03:40] The initially like the the biggest loss
[03:42] happened very quickly because the LRA
[03:44] went from uh $1 worth 1500 liters to
[03:47] 3,000 within the first 10 days of the
[03:49] uprising. That's a 50% loss. No, I
[03:52] remember I went there in January 2020
[03:54] and it was still at around
[03:56] 2,2,500. It hadn't even hit 50% yet.
[04:01] Probably the first three months. Yeah.
[04:03] Right now feel like a blur. But I would
[04:06] say like the 50% loss happened very
[04:08] quickly and then what from 3,000 it just
[04:11] kept increasing over time. So for me it
[04:14] was uh trying to withdraw initially the
[04:17] $300 but then you had something called
[04:20] the sheke bonare or the the banker's
[04:22] check that would be validated by the
[04:24] central bank saying let's say a has
[04:26] $50,000 in his uh uh bank balance. You
[04:31] would take these and you could kind of
[04:32] like barter with them. They became kind
[04:33] of what they call their lul and we would
[04:37] would just use these as whatever value
[04:39] the market would give you. So maybe you
[04:41] had $50,000 in your bank account and the
[04:44] check would say it was $50,000, but the
[04:46] actual value of that money at the time,
[04:48] let's say was in January $35,000 or
[04:51] $38,000 and that value kept decreasing.
[04:54] So I uh was initially just like taking
[04:57] money out of the ATM or from the uh the
[04:59] cashier but started issuing these
[05:01] bankers check in 2020 and trading them
[05:04] on the black market, exchanging them
[05:06] with other Lebanese traders and then
[05:08] they give you cash for that amount and
[05:09] then you can exchange that cash. So I
[05:10] had liquidated most of my uh accounts by
[05:14] June 2020. Okay. And so overall, how
[05:16] much do you think you lost compared to
[05:18] the face value in June 2019?
[05:23] uh 75% easily. Really that's interesting
[05:26] because I remember I think initially at
[05:29] that point you could withdraw all the
[05:31] money if you would take it in the
[05:33] official exchange rate. In other words,
[05:35] if you would accept that your dollar
[05:38] sorry not the official Yeah, you would
[05:40] Yes, you're right at 1.5. Yeah, you'd
[05:43] get it at 1,500. So if you had say
[05:45] $10,000, you could get 15 million
[05:49] Lebanese la, which on the black market
[05:52] would get you significantly less than
[05:53] the
[05:55] $10,000, but still that was better than
[05:58] what was going what you would be able to
[06:00] get for it the next week and the next
[06:01] month and the next year. So I remember,
[06:03] you know, this was the time when I quit
[06:04] my university job and then I got my uh
[06:08] end of uh service payment in January
[06:11] 2020. So, I went to Lebanon to pick it
[06:13] up and uh then well, I couldn't pick it
[06:16] up at that time. It needed more time.
[06:18] Then I had my sister-in-law and one of
[06:19] my friends go pick up the check, deposit
[06:22] it in my bank account, and then
[06:24] immediately withdraw it in cash at the
[06:26] face value of the cash. So, the bank
[06:29] essentially gave us the Lebanese lra uh
[06:33] equivalent of the dollars, but then so
[06:35] that was effectively a 40% loss at that
[06:37] time. I remember it. So, I took a 40%
[06:40] loss on it, but then I bought Bitcoin
[06:41] with it and the 40% basically came back
[06:43] in a couple of weeks and then, you know,
[06:46] January 2020, uh, that point I think
[06:49] Bitcoin was around 8,000. So, it's up
[06:52] 10x since then, which is, uh, you know,
[06:56] more than made up for all of the, uh,
[06:58] problems. But by you know by January and
[07:01] this is the reason why I think I mean
[07:03] you can't obviously it's horrible what
[07:05] has happened and it's terrible but at
[07:07] some level you can't feel too sorry
[07:09] about the people who lost their money in
[07:10] a sense because you know you first of
[07:14] all if you had money at that point
[07:17] you've likely earned a lot of it from
[07:19] interest. So anybody who had a million
[07:21] dollars in July 2019, many of them, you
[07:24] know, may have maybe half of that money
[07:26] was just interest accumulated over the
[07:28] last 5 years. So you started with a
[07:30] small sum, but people were earning 10
[07:32] and 15% interest. So, you know, if you
[07:36] put in $100,000, you waited 10 years and
[07:38] then it was half a million dollars and
[07:40] then you could withdraw it from the bank
[07:43] taking a 10, 20, 30% haircut, I think
[07:46] you'd be pretty unreasonable and greedy
[07:49] not to do that. Like, you've already
[07:50] increased your dollars significantly.
[07:53] You can withdraw them with a little bit
[07:54] of a loss and um you'd still come out
[07:58] ahead. I I'd say maybe for most people
[08:02] they could still come out ahead up until
[08:03] a few months into
[08:05] this. But everybody was just uh when you
[08:09] try and tell that to people, everybody's
[08:10] just so insisting that no, no, no, no,
[08:12] they're going to come back. They're
[08:13] going to find a way. They're going to
[08:16] Everybody had this insane belief in the
[08:18] idea that there are politicians out
[08:20] there that have a magic solution for
[08:22] this and all that needs to happen is
[08:24] just that they need to sit down and
[08:26] figure it out and then all the money
[08:28] will come back because they don't really
[08:30] see that it's just a big giant uh Ponzi
[08:33] fake money and there's no bringing it
[08:36] back. Yeah. Yeah. I got the gist of it
[08:37] and I heard the last five seconds. So um
[08:40] the first part when you were talking
[08:42] about the different people who got all
[08:44] their money over the years if you had
[08:46] like a million dollars and you were
[08:48] earning like let's say somewhere between
[08:50] in the in the later years like five to
[08:52] six to 7% interest but if you had put
[08:54] that money there like since the early
[08:55] 2000s I think the interest rates were
[08:57] crazy crazy on the dollar even after the
[08:59] civil war. I think there was that class
[09:01] of people and there were people who were
[09:03] kind of like really abusing that system.
[09:05] Uh I really think it's but it's hard to
[09:08] kind of like just put that as a u
[09:11] blanket kind of like sin because it it
[09:13] is a society so societal banking
[09:15] collapse that we're talking about. It's
[09:17] you're talking about a nation of let's
[09:19] say like 5 million people and I'll I'll
[09:22] start with like my example and then we
[09:23] can expand from there. Like I am
[09:25] Lebanese born in Lebanon. uh like any
[09:27] typical Lebanese diaspora, I had lived
[09:29] abroad and uh would send my money back
[09:32] home both to kind of help family or just
[09:34] to kind of put it in savings. And at the
[09:36] back of my head, the biggest fear that I
[09:38] had, I was very riskaverse the whole
[09:39] time. Not very financially literate, but
[09:41] very riskaverse. The whole point for me
[09:43] was like, hey, I just made some money.
[09:45] Now I have some measure of value with
[09:47] me. How do I preserve that? And when
[09:49] you're working kind of abroad in
[09:51] different countries, the biggest fear
[09:52] that I would have is that, oh, I'm going
[09:54] to lose my residency. I'm going to be
[09:55] fired from that job and I lose access to
[09:57] all these services in the country. I've
[09:59] worked in US, in the UK, uh in
[10:02] Australia, in the UAE, in the Gulf. For
[10:04] me, I was like, let's just put this back
[10:07] in, uh, in Lebanon, and me thinking I'm
[10:09] being smart, let's just put them in
[10:10] different bank accounts, keep them in US
[10:12] dollars, and not invest them. That was
[10:14] that was my thinking around it. what
[10:17] ended up happening and and I think a lot
[10:19] of other people that were part of that
[10:20] diaspora that were expats that were
[10:22] sending money back home were were doing
[10:24] some of that. It wasn't necessarily the
[10:27] interest rate that was driving it. For
[10:28] me it was mostly kind of like a risk
[10:30] that to say like hey it's it's going to
[10:31] be safe there. What you kind of like
[10:33] miss out on is just like reading between
[10:35] the lines like what does fiat do and
[10:37] how's that money sitting there because
[10:39] like you know very well the money in the
[10:41] bank is not yours. The minute you
[10:43] deposit money in those Lebanese banks,
[10:45] they probably like leveraged it or sold
[10:46] it. And what was happening was that a
[10:48] huge Ponty scheme that kept escalating
[10:51] and building up over 25 years. People
[10:53] would transfer money, they use those as
[10:55] money to pay out the interest for the
[10:56] people that have those six to seven
[10:58] figure balances and then uh they keep
[11:01] waiting on and they keep raising the
[11:02] interest rate to attract more and more
[11:04] funding. I think the whole pile just
[11:06] came falling down when they announced
[11:07] that with SAP tax in uh October. but
[11:11] really think like there was different
[11:12] cases and different individuals that had
[11:14] to deal with it. The Bitcoin Standard

[12:18] brought to you by the Daylight Computer.
[12:20] I love to work early in the morning and
[12:21] late at night or in the sun outdoors,
[12:23] but regular computer screens are
[12:25] terrible at these times and they strain
[12:27] your eyes. For years, I've wanted a
[12:29] paper-like electronic screen on a simple
[12:31] computer I could use to write. I tried
[12:34] several models, but none were very good.
[12:36] Now, finally, Daylight have delivered a
[12:39] fantastic full function tablet with a
[12:41] paper-like screen that's easy on your
[12:44] eyes and great for outdoor use. I've
[12:46] been using the Daylight computer to
[12:48] write my next book, and it is absolutely
[12:50] fantastic, and it has led me to invest
[12:52] in this company myself. Check out my
[12:55] interview with Anjan Kata in episode
[12:57] 249.
[12:59] Yeah, I I I obviously agree. I mean,
[13:01] this is um it's still terrible and a lot
[13:04] of people weren't doing this because of
[13:06] u you know looking to earn a lot of
[13:08] money on interest but still they could
[13:11] have gotten their money out up until
[13:13] maybe the first 6 months of this crisis.
[13:15] Yeah. I mean remember in it was in July
[13:18] that there was that there was started to
[13:20] be a black market exchange rate. In July
[13:24] 2019 the LRA broke the peg that it had
[13:28] been fixed to for about 28 years or so
[13:32] where it was 1,500 L and then it's there
[13:34] was a black market rate initially was
[13:36] 1550 then 1570 and then it just kept
[13:39] going up and for me that was the sign
[13:41] that you should have just got announced.
[13:42] You you shouldn't have been trusting any
[13:44] of the banks. But um it's remarkable how
[13:47] few people wanted to do that because
[13:49] they gotten so addicted to having their
[13:51] money in the bank and to this uh the
[13:53] incredible Ponzi. I mean it's it really
[13:55] is like a Ponzi. And when you speak to
[13:57] Lebanese people who had their money in
[13:59] the banks, a lot of them they sound like
[14:01] the shitcoiners. you know, they when the
[14:03]  corners tell you about, oh, but uh
[14:05] my corner has announced a road map
[14:07] and they're going to implement the
[14:09] surge, merge, splurge, whatever the hell
[14:11] they call it, and they're going to do
[14:13] this and this and that, and it's going
[14:14] to pump my bags. And there's just this
[14:16] incredible faith in the ability of the
[14:20] masters of their money to make them
[14:22] whole. And it's just for me, this is
[14:26] this is how they get you. You know, this
[14:27] is
[14:28] uh the the the the mouse gets caught in
[14:32] the mousetrap because it thinks the
[14:33] cheese is free and you fall for the
[14:35] shitcoins and you fall for the banking
[14:37] system and you fall for the fiat scams
[14:39] because you think that you are going to
[14:41] use these scams to your own advantage.
[14:43] So you think, okay, this shitcoin is
[14:44] silly, but I can buy it cheap and I can
[14:47] sell it before it crashes or I can get
[14:50] my money in the bank and I can get it
[14:52] out before it crashes. And then people
[14:54] just become so wedded. I think this is
[14:56] an interesting part of the psychology
[14:57] that they even though they might think
[14:59] that okay I get that this is a scam I
[15:02] get that this is sustainable but they
[15:04] get so wedded to the gains that they
[15:06] make from it that they can't imagine uh
[15:09] stopping. It's like telling an addict to
[15:11] stop taking their drug. There's always
[15:13] just okay maybe I should stop but you
[15:15] know not now. Now I need the next hit.
[15:17] Now I need the next hit. And it's always
[15:20] now and there's always a next hit that
[15:21] you need to take. So it's um it's it's
[15:25] it's it's very sad and uh I mean it's
[15:28] it's also I think there is the there's
[15:30] the analogy of the the powerful
[15:32] narrative here of individual and again
[15:34] when you don't have the transparency
[15:36] when you don't have the accountability
[15:37] when you don't have the rule of law look
[15:39] at this I mean you can you can talk
[15:40] about it in a uh kind of bitcoin
[15:43] shitcoin kind of analogy talk about it
[15:45] in terms of like the political order of
[15:47] how like Lebanon crumbled with that. If
[15:49] you talk about it in like previous
[15:51] financial collapses like Enron being the
[15:53] classical case, uh it's the idea of like
[15:55] you have those people in those positions
[15:57] of authority that we're sitting there
[15:59] the case of Lebanon, the governor of the
[16:01] central bank had this famous phrase that
[16:04] says the LRA is going to be
[16:07] okay. And for both most people like
[16:09] that's good enough. If the governor of
[16:11] the central bank of the country that I
[16:12] live in who's independent from the uh
[16:18] from the rest of the ministers and the
[16:19] rest of the government and has his own
[16:20] like if that's supposedly going to give
[16:22] me that peace of mind then all right
[16:24] I'll I'll trust whatever this guy's
[16:25] saying even the government itself being
[16:27] too slow to act or having like the
[16:28] banking
[16:29] association coming there and just
[16:31] reinforcing that message. It's really
[16:33] hard if you're not someone who can see
[16:35] through the matrix and who can
[16:36] understand that to really take that
[16:37] decision because you have those
[16:39] individuals who are in positions of
[16:41] power who do control the the uh the
[16:45] gates and who are pretty much preventing
[16:47] you from accessing the funds but they're
[16:49] just communicating a very wrong message
[16:51] for you. So up until you can either be a
[16:53] critical thinker or kind of see through
[16:55] that
[16:56] see through those cracks, that's like
[16:58] what 90 95% of people are going to like
[17:01] end up listening to them. Yeah. One of
[17:04] my one of the saddest moments for me
[17:06] about the whole Lebanese debacle was I
[17:08] think it was in
[17:09] 2021. So this was already maybe two
[17:11] years into this. The leader had already
[17:13] been destroyed and I was invited to give
[17:15] a talk over Zoom. This was
[17:17] uh COVID days. So not a lot of uh
[17:21] in-person talks happening. So I was
[17:23] invited to give a talk over Zoom and I
[17:25] spoke to a group of Lebanese people at
[17:27] some Lebanese
[17:28] organization. And one of the ladies that
[17:31] was attending her question after I sat
[17:33] there and explained Bitcoin explained
[17:35] the reasons why it works and the supply
[17:37] is fixed and there's no way that anybody
[17:39] can change the supply and the central
[17:41] banks are always printing money and you
[17:42] can see that as it happens in Lebanon.
[17:45] And the question she asked me truly blew
[17:47] my mind. And I thought it was just an ex
[17:49] an an an extreme example of why these
[17:52] disasters happen. After everything I
[17:54] said, after everything she'd went
[17:55] through, she said, "But without a
[17:57] central bank, who can guarantee the
[17:59] value of
[18:00] Bitcoin?" And how do you answer that?
[18:03] You have a central bank. And there you
[18:05] go. Look what happened. The central bank
[18:06] has destroyed the value of your currency
[18:08] by
[18:09] 90%. And during that time, Bitcoin is up
[18:11] 10fold. And here we are four years
[18:14] later. The Lebanese leader is down
[18:17] another 90% or maybe another 70% in 97 I
[18:21] think total is the final tally so far.
[18:25] And Bitcoin is up another 10x or
[18:26] something maybe or another 5x. Yeah. And
[18:30] it just keeps going up without a central
[18:32] bank. And the ones and all the
[18:34] currencies that have central banks keep
[18:35] going down. Yet, it's incredible that
[18:38] the brainwashed matrix mind simply
[18:41] cannot fathom the idea that this
[18:44] currency can work without Ariad Salami
[18:46] in charge. You know, there needs to be a
[18:47] central bank governor. He needs to get
[18:49] on TV and he needs to tell
[18:50] us everything's going to be all right.
[18:53] And then when he says everything's going
[18:54] to be all right, we can rest assured
[18:56] that it's going to be all right. So,
[18:58] even when you're presenting them with an
[18:59] alternative that doesn't have Salami,
[19:01] they still can't get it. In their mind,
[19:03] it needs to have a central bank
[19:04] governor. There needs to be a Ben
[19:05] Bernani there. There needs to be a Jay
[19:07] Powell. There needs to be somebody in
[19:09] charge to make me feel like there's
[19:11] someone that I can count on. And it's
[19:15] just such a such an incredible mental
[19:18] jump to be able to realize, oh, wait,
[19:22] those guys aren't actually in charge.
[19:24] They can't help me. They're not coming
[19:26] to save me, and I need to look out for
[19:28] myself. It's the first step you need to
[19:30] take, but most people are simply
[19:31] incapable of taking it. And it's so sad.
[19:34] Yeah. And um I think uh the idea that we
[19:38] need to have someone there just assuring
[19:41] us there's a a very similar question and
[19:44] luckily like humanity doesn't depend on
[19:45] the individual experience. Humanity and
[19:47] Bitcoin will just keep advancing
[19:49] regardless of all of our individual
[19:50] experiences long after we're gone. uh
[19:52] but there was a very similar to debacle
[19:54] that I remember reading it in a book in
[19:56] the early 1990s when the internet was uh
[20:01] starting to kind of become more widely
[20:03] adopted and there was someone who was
[20:06] saying that story who said he went to a
[20:08] conference in France and he was about he
[20:10] was a software engineer so he came up on
[20:13] stage and did this presentation what is
[20:15] the internet how does it work how does
[20:16] it give you access to all these
[20:18] different resources and then the first
[20:19] question he gets from the audience was
[20:22] who is the CEO of the
[20:24] internet? Can I go find that person?
[20:26] Like I need to tell him like oh bring
[20:27] the internet to France or bring the
[20:29] internet to Europe. Like there is that
[20:31] idea. Probably it's evolutionary.
[20:33] Probably it's biases or brainwashing a
[20:35] combination. We need someone that we can
[20:38] hold accountable that can appease our
[20:40] minds and tell us no guys don't worry.
[20:43] Like I'm someone who knows better than
[20:44] you. I'm someone who can inform you. I'm
[20:47] someone who can like put you at ease.
[20:48] because it's uh it helps kind of like
[20:51] calm the mind a bit to know that I'm the
[20:53] one who doesn't understand something and
[20:55] someone else is coming and telling me
[20:56] like they can they can do that. That
[20:57] that kind of removes the responsibility
[20:59] on me.
[21:01] Yeah. And this is also a problem for me
[21:03] as a Bitcoiner because people don't get
[21:05] the idea that when I'm trying to tell
[21:06] them about Bitcoin, they can't grasp the
[21:08] idea that I'm not the CEO of Bitcoin or
[21:10] that I don't work for the CEO of Bitcoin
[21:12] that I'm not selling you my bitcoins
[21:14] that this isn't my own thing and I'm not
[21:16] guaranteeing it for you and you don't
[21:18] need to trust me for it to work. You
[21:19] need to go and understand how the actual
[21:21] thing works and it's completely
[21:22] independent of me. If I die tomorrow,
[21:24] Bitcoin is going to continue to take
[21:26] along. But people are just that they
[21:30] need someone in charge. They need to
[21:32] have somebody in charge and they need to
[21:34] attribute everything to somebody. It
[21:36] just so much easier psychologically, I
[21:39] think. But it's very depressing because
[21:40] it makes you very very gullible and very
[21:44] ripe for scamming. Oh yes. Yeah. The
[21:47] best narrative wins. And I think it's
[21:49] been across like history. We've seen it
[21:51] time and again in different iterations.
[21:53] Um Bitcoin kind of being one of them.
[21:56] Yeah, but the good thing about Bitcoin,
[21:58] of course, is that we don't need to
[21:59] convince these people. They just
[22:01] continue to suffer and the people who
[22:04] choose Bitcoin continue to thrive. And
[22:06] it's just it's so amazing because it's
[22:08] really freeing when you don't need to
[22:09] convince people about something because
[22:12] that's it. This is the reality. Bitcoin
[22:14] is going to win not because it's going
[22:15] to win a popularity context, not because
[22:18] we're going to have a an an election and
[22:19] then the voter is the voters are going
[22:21] to decide we want to implement the
[22:23] Bitcoin system. It's going to win
[22:25] because people who choose Bitcoin are
[22:26] going to grow their wealth and people
[22:28] who don't choose Bitcoin are going to
[22:29] lose their wealth. You keep playing that
[22:31] out long enough. Yeah. The the best
[22:34] indicator for me when we're close to a
[22:36] market top is when I start getting
[22:37] messages again of like what how much
[22:39] money should I buy into Bitcoin or into
[22:42] like once those messages there's always
[22:44] kind of an uptick that happens before
[22:45] some kind of a market peak. And that for
[22:48] me that's that's when I say like okay
[22:49] like it seems like everyone's interested
[22:51] in it again. So, um, I've always kind of
[22:54] had the same answer for the past, let's
[22:56] say, six years, which is invest as much
[22:58] as you're willing to not lose sleep
[22:59] over. Like that's I think where they
[23:02] should internally put that benchmark for
[23:03] them because I don't want to be the one
[23:05] who they come to and say like, "Hey,
[23:07] I've lost like 5% uh on Bitcoin you told
[23:09] me about two months ago." Like I just
[23:11] say put as much and forget about it.
[23:13] Just like leave it and put enough that
[23:16] you don't that you won't lose sleep over
[23:18] it because at the end of the day like we
[23:19] all have different risk appetites. Some
[23:21] people are willing to tolerate those
[23:22] like swings. Some people are just saying
[23:24] like, "Hey, I'm putting this as a spec,
[23:26] I still consider this a speculative
[23:27] asset. The rest like putting stuff for
[23:29] me, not in Egyptian pounds, not in euros
[23:31] and dollars, that's good enough. Putting
[23:33] stuff to gold, that's good enough. So
[23:34] for me, Bitcoin is just kind of an
[23:36] asset, a small like asset that I'm going
[23:39] to bet on on the side. And to each their
[23:41] own.
[23:42] Yeah. I say something similar, which is
[23:44] buy whatever you think you can hold for
[23:46] five years and just keep adding to it.
[23:48] all the money that you don't need in the
[23:50] next 5 years that you won't have to sell
[23:53] over the next few months or few years.
[23:56] Yes, that's money you can keep in
[23:58] Bitcoin and then just keep adding to it.
[24:00] Um, but if you want to be aggressive,
[24:03] uh, you know, I
[24:04] recommend increasing your income as much
[24:06] as you can, decreasing your income as
[24:08] much as you can, putting everything in
[24:10] Bitcoin and waiting five years and just
[24:12] being very convicted about it to the
[24:15] point where doesn't matter what's going
[24:16] to happen, you're going to
[24:18] As long as you're cash flow positive,
[24:20] you can afford that conviction. As long
[24:22] as you spend less than you earn, then
[24:24] you can just keep living, you know, on
[24:27] living on the bare minimum for 5 years.
[24:29] I think you could really change your
[24:30] life if you do that. I if you run the
[24:32] numbers on pretty much any any kind of
[24:34] income or any kind of wealth if you do
[24:36] this, you know, five year hodling and or
[24:39] five year
[24:40] stacking, it ends up being pretty uh
[24:43] pretty serious and significant
[24:45] life-changing money. But that actually
[24:48] was one of the first lessons we learned
[24:49] with Zelda. Um the whole idea of like
[24:52] how much money you preserve and how to
[24:53] keep it. And we can like also why we're
[24:55] doing the bit like the multi-year
[24:58] Bitcoin back loans. But it's this idea
[24:59] of having a low time
[25:02] preference with Zoda which is the
[25:04] company that like founded three years
[25:06] ago when we decided to do something
[25:08] about increasing Bitcoin adoption in the
[25:11] region. The first idea that came was
[25:13] like okay I managed to take my money out
[25:15] now. Let's see how and I've helped like
[25:17] some family and friends do the same
[25:19] thing. How does this turn into a
[25:20] business or how can I help others do it?
[25:22] The very very first idea was let's do
[25:25] something like the lightning network in
[25:26] the region. So you can facilitate
[25:27] transactions and transfers from one part
[25:30] of the country or or across the Middle
[25:32] East more easily for businesses kind of
[25:33] like a western union but on the
[25:35] lightning network. The lesson learned
[25:37] there was that before you use something
[25:38] as a medium of exchange people need to
[25:40] believe it as a store of value. So the
[25:42] conversation with clients are like okay
[25:43] before I start transferring SATs I need
[25:45] to like buy Bitcoin. So you got to like
[25:47] bring them on board what is Bitcoin and
[25:49] let me buy Bitcoin before I can transfer
[25:50] it uh as a medium of exchange. Uh the
[25:54] the thing we ended up going with when we
[25:56] got into the accelerator in New York was
[25:59] a bitcoin savings plan. I think you and
[26:02] I when we first met that was the idea
[26:04] that we had demoed uh in in the US and
[26:08] now we were going to like go and find
[26:10] clients for it. What you notice is that
[26:13] again there's the US, there's Europe and
[26:15] there's the rest of the world. Uh you
[26:17] have all these different level all these
[26:18] different economies. One of the
[26:20] conversations we were having is if I
[26:22] want to convince you to put part of your
[26:23] savings into Bitcoin, it makes sense
[26:26] when some you're a middle- class fellow,
[26:28] you're earning a stable salary, you're
[26:30] able to put somewhere between like one
[26:34] 10 20% of your salary away every month
[26:36] into something like Bitcoin and have and
[26:38] and still kind of live a good life. the
[26:41] the conversations we were having with
[26:42] clients and with users here was that
[26:44] hey, I'm earning $500 in local currency
[26:47] that's devaluating and that's barely
[26:49] enough for me to be able to feed my
[26:51] family, send my kids to school, uh pay
[26:53] my rent, pay my mortgage. So, the kind
[26:56] of like the fact that you're asking me
[26:58] to put on top of that another 5% just to
[27:00] invest him on the side was was kind of
[27:02] like very lost on them because maybe in
[27:05] uh uh the US the average salary might be
[27:07] somewhere between let's say 15 $25,000.
[27:10] not sure today after inflation uh here
[27:13] in the in Egypt where I live it's more
[27:15] close to like 500 $4 to
[27:17] $500 in uh other parts of the Middle
[27:20] East you can find that as well. So how
[27:22] do you start finding ways for people to
[27:25] believe in that asset class and how do
[27:27] you start bringing them on board which
[27:28] is why we went through those different
[27:30] iterations to come to the model that we
[27:31] have today. The Bitcoin Standard podcast

[28:57] bitcoinway.com and start bitcoining more
[29:01] confidently. Yeah. So, what was well-
[29:05] Before I get I should say yeah I
[29:07] definitely agree. I think this is this
[29:09] explains so much of the failures of so
[29:12] many of the business models that a lot
[29:13] of Bitcoin companies have had which
[29:16] basically think of Bitcoin as being a
[29:18] replacement for credit cards and Visa
[29:20] and Mastercard and Western Union. And
[29:23] the idea here is well you can move
[29:25] Bitcoin quickly. So therefore people who
[29:27] are having trouble moving money around
[29:29] then they can just move use Bitcoin. And
[29:31] of course there's a first problem which
[29:33] is that onchain Bitcoin is not that fast
[29:35] actually there's 10 minutes at least
[29:37] what not at least but usually there's an
[29:39] average of 10 minutes to get one
[29:40] confirmation and it can take much longer
[29:42] sometimes so it's not very conducive for
[29:45] consumer payments but I think the even
[29:46] if you do solve for that and lightning
[29:48] does solve for that you have a massive
[29:51] problem which is if the um pair and the
[29:55] receiver both don't hold Bitcoin then
[29:59] all you're doing is just adding uh
[30:01] enormous amount of exchange uh rate
[30:04] slippage in both transactions. So, if I
[30:06] need to send you
[30:07] $1,000 and your business operates on
[30:10] dollars and your cash balance is in
[30:12] dollars and my cash balance is in
[30:14] dollars, then I need to convert my
[30:16] dollars to Bitcoin and then you need to
[30:17] convert the Bitcoin to dollars. In those
[30:20] two transfers, we've likely eaten up all
[30:22] of the benefits from
[30:24] um whatever savings Bitcoin allows us to
[30:27] do. It ends up being the case in most of
[30:29] these cases that even for international
[30:32] uh
[30:33] remittances, usually international
[30:35] remittances are being handled by Western
[30:38] Union offices or things like that that
[30:40] handle them at scale. And so they're
[30:42] able to give you a pretty decent u
[30:46] markup when they send you the money
[30:48] across borders because you're not the
[30:50] only one. There are a lot of people in
[30:52] your country uh selling sending to the
[30:54] other country and a lot of people in the
[30:55] other country sending here. So all of
[30:57] these get tallied and netted out by the
[31:00] Western Union and then each office
[31:02] receives or gets paid a little bit of
[31:04] money and so it ends up being a lot more
[31:07] economical because you don't have to go
[31:09] through two foreign exchange
[31:10] transactions at the front end and the
[31:13] back end of the transaction. So what
[31:15] needs to happen for people to be using
[31:16] the transactions in Bitcoin is not some
[31:19] technical thing that needs to be added
[31:20] to Bitcoin because Lightning already
[31:22] works. It's for more people to be
[31:24] holding cash balances in Bitcoin. If you
[31:26] and I both have Bitcoin, then I can send
[31:29] you some of my Bitcoin and you can add
[31:31] to your Bitcoin stash. And then in that
[31:33] case, we don't need to convert in and
[31:35] out of dollars. And so therefore, then
[31:37] Bitcoin becomes a truly compelling way
[31:39] of sending money abroad or of sending
[31:42] money or or of paying for your coffee,
[31:44] paying for a sandwich, whatever it is,
[31:47] then it becomes possible. Then you see
[31:49] how powerful lightning is because it's
[31:51] going to be a few cents or less than a
[31:53] cent even for me to move sums of money
[31:56] from me to you and you keep them in
[31:58] Bitcoin. I keep them in Bitcoin and the
[32:01] transaction fees are in are very tiny.
[32:04] And this angers a lot of people who um
[32:07] it's it's such a horrible example of
[32:09] what Mises calls the anti- capitalist
[32:11] mentality where they can't understand
[32:13] this point because they don't understand
[32:14] economics. They don't understand money.
[32:16] They think of money as being a
[32:18] government uh toy that government
[32:21] invents to allow us to play with one
[32:23] another. They don't understand that
[32:24] money emerges out of people holding it
[32:26] as cash balance and that whatever has
[32:28] the hard the most cash cash balances
[32:31] ends up being money by default. And so
[32:33] they think of this as oh you just want
[32:36] Bitcoin to get rich. People just you
[32:38] just want Bitcoin people to hold Bitcoin
[32:39] so that they could get rich. As if a
[32:43] it's my call to decide what people can
[32:45] and cannot do with Bitcoin and B as if
[32:48] being rich is a bad thing. like, oh no,
[32:50] he wants all Bitcoin users to stop being
[32:52] poor. How awful. What happens if there
[32:56] are no poor people left? You know, how
[32:58] are we going to grift as leftists and
[33:01] socialists and Marxists who want to live
[33:03] off of pretending to be
[33:06] we're terrible at forecasting as humans.
[33:08] We're terrible at predicting what's
[33:10] going to come next. I mean, look at look
[33:12] at Blade Runner the when it was done in
[33:14] 1982. It was set in 2019.
[33:17] And in 2019, the way it was showing you
[33:19] like these futuristic skyscrapers and
[33:21] what it was supposed to look like uh but
[33:23] then you still had these old devices
[33:25] like they hadn't they they overshot on
[33:27] one side but they on the hardware on the
[33:29] hardware side but they undersshot on the
[33:30] software side which I have to credit
[33:32] like that was from Lyn Alden's last
[33:34] newsletter. She was like using that
[33:35] analogy but I think it works very well
[33:38] because you uh you can really see that
[33:40] we can kind of like put like the Jetsons
[33:42] when they were like done and how they
[33:43] they kind of looked at the year60. Same
[33:46] thing can be said with like Bitcoin like
[33:48] hardcore Bitcoiners where want to say
[33:49] like oh like we need to make Bitcoin as
[33:51] the only store of value and medium of
[33:53] exchange that people use as well. There
[33:54] needs to be this adoption scurve and we
[33:58] are kind of like a mighty force and we
[34:00] are growing every day but still we're in
[34:03] the still store of value scurve once
[34:05] we've kind of completed through that and
[34:06] once we've kind of gone through this and
[34:07] there's enough nation states and
[34:09] institutions holding it as a store of
[34:10] value then and like people start uh
[34:13] denominating stuff in bitcoin then you
[34:15] can say all right let's exchange like uh
[34:17] I need to like get a coaching session
[34:20] from you and like how much is it in sats
[34:22] and we can start having that baring and
[34:24] exchange system. But up until then, we
[34:26] just got to like wait for this to
[34:27] happen. Neither you and I can predict
[34:29] exactly when, but it will happen one
[34:31] day.
[34:33] Yeah. And you know, uh to to show how it
[34:37] actually is happening, I you know, all
[34:39] of these people who can be critical of
[34:41] me for emphasizing the role of Bitcoin
[34:43] as a way to stop getting poor and
[34:46] selfish uh the selfish use case of
[34:49] Bitcoin. I don't think any of them has u
[34:53] conducted as many commerce transactions
[34:54] in Bitcoin than I do. My website accepts
[34:57] Bitcoin and I get about a third of my
[34:59] revenue I think from Bitcoin roughly
[35:01] speaking. I don't have updated data but
[35:03] somewhere in that range. So about a
[35:05] third of the money that comes into my
[35:06] website comes in Bitcoin and then all of
[35:08] the salaries that I pay everybody who
[35:10] works for me gets paid in Bitcoin. I
[35:11] don't pay anybody in anything else. So
[35:13] every month I'm
[35:14] conducting hundreds of transactions
[35:17] basically receiving and sending uh
[35:19] bitcoin but I only do that because I
[35:22] have developed a bitcoin cash balance.
[35:25] My cash balance is primarily bitcoin and
[35:27] because of that I'm able to take the
[35:29] foreign exchange risk of the changing in
[35:33] value of bitcoin because it doesn't
[35:35] matter to me because my money is in
[35:36] bitcoin anyway. If I didn't have
[35:38] bitcoin, if bitcoin was less than 1% of
[35:40] my portfolio, this wouldn't make sense.
[35:41] the business wouldn't work. It wouldn't
[35:43] shut down. I'd always be having to sell
[35:46] uh I'd always find myself having to sell
[35:48] dollars in order to buy Bitcoin in order
[35:50] to pay people or having to sell Bitcoin
[35:53] uh to make dollars to pay um to to to
[35:57] pay bills or something like that. But
[35:58] only when you develop a cash balance and
[36:00] then I hire people only who have Bitcoin
[36:02] because they want to get because I don't
[36:04] want to have to deal with fiat payments.
[36:06] Then you know I all everybody who works
[36:07] with me uses Bitcoin as well. So,
[36:10] everybody's got Bitcoin cash balances
[36:11] and that makes life easy. So, if you
[36:14] want Bitcoin payments adoption, you want
[36:16] more Bitcoin cash balances. Sorry,
[36:20] there's no escaping it. Yeah, that's how
[36:22] people have to do it. U and I think up
[36:24] until that comes, we'll have to wait.
[36:27] Yeah, we keep stacking cheap sats
[36:28] basically and that's the opportunity.
[36:31] It's I think also a lot of the uh
[36:33] bitterness on this issue sadly comes
[36:36] from the fact that it's not just an
[36:38] ideological or intellectual mistake that
[36:41] you make and then oh maybe I realized I
[36:44] was wrong. But if you've approached
[36:45] Bitcoin as a masterard replacement and
[36:48] you spent the last 5 years or 10 years
[36:50] as in some cases talking about the need
[36:52] for Bitcoin to be a masterard
[36:55] replacement,
[36:57] well, you likely didn't buy a lot of
[37:00] Bitcoin. And so that we have a lot of
[37:02] people who spend a lot of time working
[37:04] on Bitcoin adoption, Bitcoin technology
[37:06] or programming solutions for Bitcoin
[37:09] because they think of Bitcoin as this
[37:10] kind of uh payment network, but they
[37:12] don't think of it as an asset. And so
[37:14] they never accumulated assets. Yeah. And
[37:18] that turns out to be a very expensive
[37:19] mistake because if you had driven an
[37:21] Uber during those 10 years instead of
[37:24] trying to evangelize Bitcoin and then
[37:27] stacked SATs, you'd probably be in a
[37:29] much better place today. Both in terms
[37:32] of financial wealth, but also perhaps
[37:35] more importantly, both in terms of your
[37:37] ability to spread Bitcoin payments. If
[37:39] you wanted to spread Bitcoin payments,
[37:41] you should have stacked SATs so that you
[37:42] would have a big cash balance in Bitcoin
[37:45] and then you can buy things with Bitcoin
[37:46] and then you can hire people for Bitcoin
[37:48] and then you can sell things for
[37:49] Bitcoin. That's how you would actually
[37:51] do it. But staying broke and staying in
[37:54] fiat and holding your cash balance in
[37:56] fiat is hurting you and hurting Bitcoin
[37:59] payments adoption. Yeah. And uh I think
[38:02] let launching a startup in this space in
[38:04] that part of the world like that's
[38:05] that's a whole like different experience
[38:06] trying to just convince people about
[38:10] what this is again like there's the
[38:12] narrative of like there's Bitcoin and
[38:13] there's the others shitcoins there is
[38:16] kind of like digital assets as a space
[38:18] there's startups as an like you just got
[38:20] to go through all like you got to peel
[38:22] the layer of the onion and you really
[38:23] kind of got to look for your early
[38:26] adopters and right now really the early
[38:28] adopters are the ones that have cash
[38:30] balances in Bitcoin. for us. They're the
[38:32] ones who because me like I we we even at
[38:35] one point we were trying to get a
[38:36] license in Egypt. We knew someone in the
[38:38] central bank and we sat down with them
[38:41] that was in December
[38:43] 2023. So Egypt was, if you remember,
[38:46] going through a massive kind of like FX
[38:49] crisis. The uh official rate of the
[38:52] Egyptian pound was 30. On the black
[38:54] market, it was it went up to 75.
[38:57] And I remember I was like loving this
[38:58] because I was just exchanging my uh
[39:00] bitcoins doing it at 75 a dollar to to
[39:03] 75 pounds and then getting that getting
[39:05] that arbitrage opportunity. But we sat
[39:08] down and we said we have a solution. We
[39:09] can try to help kind of like let Egypt
[39:12] solve this FX crisis by either mining
[39:15] Bitcoin by adopting Bitcoin making it
[39:17] legal tender like we can just help you
[39:18] eliminate that black market. And we are
[39:20] showing them some numbers and doing some
[39:22] simulations for them which allowed them
[39:23] if they invested part of their treasury,
[39:25] they could be generating something like
[39:26] $30 million from mining Bitcoin uh per
[39:29] month uh in Egypt. And Egypt kind of has
[39:31] like a lot of sunshine, a lot of like
[39:33] strong wind, so they can use like
[39:34] renewable energy to mine Bitcoin there.
[39:36] I had no idea at the same time they were
[39:39] having these parallel discussions to
[39:40] sell this piece of land in the north for
[39:42] $ 35 billion. Like this is this is what
[39:44] they were talking about and this is how
[39:45] big of a hole they had to plug. So we're
[39:48] very like politely pushed away and said
[39:50] like this is not a priority for us now.
[39:52] We're just going to sell up big piece of
[39:54] land from the country or give it away to
[39:56] the Emiratis and then get $35 billion
[39:58] for it. So I think like that that just
[40:01] shows you like where different
[40:03] institutions where different governments
[40:04] are when it comes to that. Uh and we
[40:07] ended up just kind of switching to
[40:08] Bahrain where we're getting our license
[40:11] right now. They're the ones who have
[40:13] actual like uh regulation and compliance
[40:15] and also they were the first one in the
[40:16] region to to do it. So we got a good
[40:19] intro to someone at the central bank
[40:20] there and we've been working with them
[40:22] to get that license.
[40:24] Yeah.
[40:26] So h how did you um how did you evolve
[40:30] with the business? You you moved to
[40:32] Egypt but the business business has not
[40:33] been based in Egypt, right? You're based
[40:35] in Dubai, right? Our clients are uh
[40:38] Egyptians at this stage like but they
[40:39] have accounts in Dubai. So we were kind
[40:41] of like the use case was how can we help
[40:43] people that already hold Bitcoin custody
[40:45] it is that the
[40:48] current the current solution or the
[40:50] current uh product that we offer is
[40:53] anyone who owns at least the equivalent
[40:55] of 100k Bitcoin or one Bitcoin is is
[40:59] kind of a potential client for us. The
[41:01] reason that is is we're trying to create
[41:02] a middle ground between self custody and
[41:05] putting on exchanges. If you have a
[41:07] small amount of your net worth on
[41:08] exchanges, classical exchanges, not the
[41:10] ones that like pull you, I think you're
[41:13] relatively okay pending some kind of a
[41:14] black swan event, you take your own risk
[41:16] if you're on Binance and other exchanges
[41:18] of that size. Uh if you're in self-
[41:21] custody, you're also kind of like
[41:22] responsible, you're technically savvy,
[41:24] you know how to do it with what we're
[41:26] trying to offer is the classical multiix
[41:28] setup that you see with a lot of other
[41:30] uh companies in this space. And it's the
[41:33] idea here is just eliminate the single
[41:34] point of failure. If uh I'm uh
[41:37] self-custodying and someone comes to me
[41:38] today or or I die in like an accident
[41:41] and I haven't kind of put in the right
[41:42] measures in place or my family doesn't
[41:45] know how to access that bitcoin, it's
[41:46] gone forever. With multi-stick custody,
[41:49] we're trying to put in several solutions
[41:50] that allow to make the bitcoin
[41:52] recoverable because the biggest issue
[41:54] you kind of like care about is like it's
[41:56] if it's digital money like how do I get
[41:58] it? How do I know it exists? How can I
[42:00] access it and know that it's going to be
[42:01] there? if uh if your company goes under
[42:04] what happens if uh if I like lose access
[42:06] to the internet what happens so the
[42:08] whole idea is like on one side we're
[42:10] being compliant and following the
[42:12] regulations of a central bank in the
[42:14] region whatever they tell us and
[42:15] whatever they want us to do like we're
[42:17] we're being compliant with that on the
[42:18] other we're trying to build these
[42:20] redundancies so you don't have to go
[42:21] through what I personally went through
[42:23] through what every Lebanese went through
[42:25] what other people in the region are
[42:26] experiencing as well from Turkey to
[42:27] Egypt to other count to other countries
[42:30] just become come in control of your
[42:32] funds and understand that if Bitcoin is
[42:35] going to be that store of value for you,
[42:36] you don't have to take the risks that
[42:38] come with uh for example putting on an
[42:40] exchange and exchange going down or not
[42:42] being technically savvy enough to do
[42:44] self- custody.
[42:47] Uhhuh. And how's how's the uptake been
[42:50] so far or how do you find the uh appeal
[42:54] among people in this region?
[42:57] Slow. Uh it's it's a bit different u
[43:01] selling here than it is selling to
[43:03] countries that have probably a more
[43:07] established or stable fiat currency. For
[43:10] us, it's right now if anyone wants to
[43:12] invest something outside of the local
[43:14] currency in most countries in the
[43:16] region, you're looking at three to four
[43:18] major asset classes. You're looking at
[43:20] real estate, you're looking at gold,
[43:22] you're looking at the US dollar, uh and
[43:24] you're looking potentially at equities.
[43:27] And all of these usually track the kind
[43:28] of debasement of those local currencies.
[43:30] So uh in the case of uh Egypt for
[43:33] example, the real estate market has like
[43:35] quintupled almost since the devaluation
[43:37] of the pound. Uh in Lebanon, you had
[43:40] this whole flight to uh different asset
[43:42] classes like people were buying luxury
[43:44] cars, they were buying boats, like
[43:45] anything just to not put it in local
[43:47] currency or the dollars that are stuck
[43:49] in the bank. for us kind of like we're
[43:51] just trying to say, okay, the first user
[43:54] or the early adopter for us is someone
[43:55] who already holds Bitcoin, someone who
[43:57] already believes in the value of
[43:58] Bitcoin. That's a very small market to
[44:00] start with and because we kind of like
[44:02] pegged it at like one bitcoin or 100k
[44:04] because if you have like less than 100k,
[44:06] it's not worth paying the fees for us.
[44:07] Just put it on an exchange. If you know
[44:08] how to do self custody, just do it. The
[44:11] benefit we have is that as Bitcoin's
[44:12] value increase, our market keeps
[44:14] expanding. So when like one bitcoin now
[44:16] is 100k, in 10 years time, how much is
[44:18] one bitcoin going to be worth? or how
[44:20] much is like 0.1 bitcoin if it goes by
[44:21] 10x then anyone who owns 0.1 bitcoin
[44:23] will be a good uh part of our target
[44:26] markets but this is where we're starting
[44:28] at and this is the kind of benchmark
[44:29] that we're building the thing that we're
[44:31] and and that's not going to
[44:33] be large enough to build a uh a business
[44:36] with or a scalable business for the
[44:39] region which is why we've added the
[44:40] second layer to it after kind of again
[44:43] having those conversations which is you
[44:45] have your bitcoin so has been holding
[44:47] bitcoin for five years uh Uh, and that
[44:49] Bitcoin has 10xed. I feel very excited.
[44:52] I feel I want to go spend it on
[44:53] something and deposit on a house. I want
[44:55] to do something with it because I feel
[44:57] like I've earned the return now and I
[44:59] can cash some of it out. I feel both now
[45:03] for individuals and businesses. There is
[45:05] this other ideas like keep your
[45:07] bitcoins. If you really believe in it
[45:08] and you buy into the philosophy, we're
[45:10] here to offer you a loan at a
[45:13] competitive rate that will allow you
[45:16] just to use the fiat liquidity to do
[45:19] what you need. And we're only doing that
[45:21] now for businesses rather than
[45:22] individuals because with businesses the
[45:24] kind of like emotional angle like the
[45:25] emotional volatility is less. With an
[45:27] individual you can say I want to buy
[45:29] that and I it's my money I'll go and do
[45:30] it. with a business when you've put it
[45:32] as part of your treasury, you need to
[45:34] have like more uh bal like you need to
[45:36] have checks and balances about when you
[45:38] want to sell that bitcoin. So the idea
[45:39] for us is that as a business, you've put
[45:41] Bitcoin on your balance sheet, part of
[45:43] your treasury now. It's increased in
[45:45] value. You have business expenses. You
[45:48] need some liquidity for it. We could
[45:50] facilitate that for you. Again, we're
[45:52] starting very small. We're doing
[45:54] somewhere between$10 to $20,000 in loan.
[45:57] But our target market here is not the
[45:59] asset managers, not the oil companies.
[46:01] It's the 20 or so million small
[46:03] businesses in the region that have no
[46:04] access to capital. So, it's a way of
[46:07] incentivizing them, saying like as a
[46:08] business, whatever you earn, put it in
[46:10] Bitcoin, build a Bitcoin stash from
[46:11] there, take a loan against it, and we
[46:13] will structure these loans in a way that
[46:15] doesn't put you
[46:17] uh doesn't put us in a way that we're
[46:19] cannibalizing it. We're not going to be
[46:20] charging you 18% on those loans. This is
[46:22] not a way for you to save on capital
[46:24] gains tax. Uh this is a way for you to
[46:26] just be able to follow through on your
[46:29] business. We want to encourage like
[46:30] entrepreneurship. We want to support the
[46:31] small business but also to preserve your
[46:33] Bitcoin purchasing power. Healthcare is
[46:36] one of the biggest problems in fiat
[46:37] world and health insurance in
[46:38] particular. In my work and on this
[46:40] podcast, we've discussed at length the
[46:43] many ways in which modern medicine and
[46:44] insurance fail. And I'm very proud to be
[46:47] presenting my listeners with an
[46:48] excellent Bitcoin-based alternative.

[47:37] safe s a
[47:40] f. Yeah, I think the case is pretty
[47:42] compelling from a financial perspective.
[47:44] as Michael Seder puts it, ultimately
[47:46] Bitcoin appreciates higher per year than
[47:50] the vast majority of interest rates that
[47:52] you can get.
[47:54] So if you're going to borrow, it's, you
[47:58] know, you look at the interest rates
[47:59] that you could have been offered over
[48:00] the last 10 years and you compare them
[48:01] to the appreciation of Bitcoin and you
[48:04] find that you would have come out ahead
[48:05] no matter what interest rate you would
[48:07] have gotten pretty much as long as you
[48:10] had the ability to withstand a 12 to
[48:15] 18month brutal bare market. If you're
[48:18] still cash flow positive to be
[48:19] continuing to make payments during that
[48:21] period, then you know you just stick it
[48:24] out through that period and you come out
[48:25] ahead on top uh on the other end because
[48:29] the appreciation bitcoin is just too
[48:31] large and this is the case against
[48:33] selling bitcoin. But of course there are
[48:37] other u counter arguments primarily the
[48:40] idea that uh you're uh risking your
[48:44] bitcoin now you know when you sell it
[48:46] all right it's gone you have the money
[48:47] that you can spend on other things but
[48:50] uh when you lend it you're paying an
[48:53] interest and then there's the risk that
[48:55] the lender defaults
[48:57] uh the borrower defaults and then you
[49:00] are in trouble. Um, so what are your uh
[49:04] what are your thoughts on that and how
[49:05] do you guys try and keep clients
[49:07] bitcoins safe? What do you do with the
[49:09] bitcoins?
[49:11] So it builds on the multi setup. So it's
[49:14] two out of three which means that you
[49:15] need two signatures to access the
[49:17] bitcoin and when you want to move into
[49:19] uh bitcoin back loans you have a third
[49:21] party that comes in. So the third party
[49:23] has one of the keys, zoda has the key
[49:25] and the borrower has one of the keys.
[49:27] You need two to unlock the funds. That's
[49:29] number one. So there the keys are
[49:31] spread. Number two is we're setting a
[49:34] low LTV loan to value
[49:36] ratio. We've looked at kind of like the
[49:39] fluctuation volatility of Bitcoin over
[49:41] the past 3 to four years. And if you put
[49:45] an LTV of 40% what we what you can say
[49:48] is that when was the last time that
[49:50] Bitcoin dipped 60%. And over how long?
[49:53] Because that's what's usually going to
[49:54] lead to liquidation and margin call. it
[49:56] is you can say a kind of leverage but
[49:58] like when you lower the LTV it's a bit
[50:01] different so when did bitcoin move from
[50:03] like 100 to 40k and how fast that
[50:06] happened and the last instance you can
[50:08] look at that was the the dip that
[50:10] happened between when Luna uh crashed
[50:13] and when FTX crashed that was about a
[50:16] period of like five months when bitcoin
[50:17] like really went that 60% decrease in
[50:20] value so you have enough time what I'm
[50:23] trying to say is to replenish your
[50:26] collateral to add to it. And that that's
[50:28] what's going to help us prevent a margin
[50:30] call is that like if it get if it kind
[50:31] of dips, let's say to 75%, if it dips to
[50:34] 60%, 55, you're going to be getting
[50:36] notifications. And if those things are
[50:38] happening concurrently, we know that
[50:40] you'll you'll have enough time based on
[50:42] Bitcoin's price history to be able to
[50:44] replenish that collateral. Uh that's
[50:46] number two. Uh number three is I think
[50:49] the grace period between when you want
[50:50] to pay back those uh the interest. So
[50:52] the interest usually is fixed. So we uh
[50:55] do it like for 12 months and then you
[50:57] can renew your loan. It's not you're not
[50:59] like kind
[51:00] of an Islamic law like you're not just
[51:02] charging interest on the time. You're
[51:04] just saying if you want to take out a
[51:05] loan uh for $10,000 with your Bitcoin
[51:08] with like $20,000 of Bitcoin and we're
[51:11] going to charge you 8% on it. So 10.8
[51:13] it's going to be 10.8 for that year. It
[51:15] doesn't matter like how much time goes.
[51:17] And then you can replenish that alone
[51:18] and add more uh time to it if you want
[51:21] to take it over several years. So for
[51:24] us, we just kind of like try to keep it
[51:25] fixed like that and then you'll have
[51:27] about three days to pay back the
[51:28] interest on your loan every month. That
[51:31] gives you kind of a bit of a wiggle
[51:32] room. But yeah, we're learning from it.
[51:34] We're launching it and uh we're
[51:36] collaborating with different partners
[51:37] that have done that. I know that this
[51:40] model has worked well in the US with
[51:42] Unchained. They've uh done Bitcoin back
[51:45] loans. I know that Leen is doing it in
[51:47] Canada. There the use case is very
[51:50] different. there. It's kind of like a
[51:52] tax advantage for us. It's like let's
[51:54] charge a lower interest rate in the US
[51:56] and give it to you in US dollars and
[51:58] then we can help you uh get liquidity
[52:00] and convert that convert that liquidity
[52:02] into a local currency that can help you
[52:05] sustain your business.
[52:08] Fantastic. And do you see yourself
[52:10] expanding into other kinds of products
[52:11] in the region or do you just focus on
[52:13] these for now?
[52:15] want to see like again like with any
[52:17] startup we want to just be focused uh up
[52:20] until we don't see enough traction. So
[52:21] we've had some let's say pre- product
[52:24] market fit traction on that it's not
[52:26] kind of like we're not having the phone
[52:27] ring every day on it but because it's uh
[52:31] because of the nature of like who I am
[52:33] of how I'm running the business uh
[52:35] because of the nature of Bitcoin like we
[52:36] want to honor low time preference. So
[52:37] for us it's not like let's grow as fast
[52:39] as possible at any cost. The idea here
[52:41] is like let's grow sustainably with the
[52:43] right partners. And that's why I told at
[52:45] the beginning like the very first people
[52:46] we want to start with are not people
[52:47] that own like shitcoins. We want people
[52:49] that own bitcoin that believe in the
[52:50] value of bitcoin. It's a small market
[52:52] but it's a it's a market that keeps
[52:54] expanding every day as bitcoin's value
[52:55] appreciates. So we will just keep
[52:57] growing with that market. Now if the
[53:00] loans start accelerating like we're only
[53:03] doing only $50,000 in loan now. If you
[53:06] can start 10xing that and 100xing that,
[53:09] this is where I think the business can
[53:10] have show a lot of problems. And this is
[53:12] where we're getting most of the kind of
[53:13] interest from small businesses to say
[53:14] like, "All right, I'm interested in that
[53:17] potential option and the the interest
[53:18] rate that you're charging because if I'm
[53:20] going to be paying 26% in the local
[53:22] currency and you're charging me 8% in US
[53:24] dollars, that to me sounds like both too
[53:27] good to be true, but also it's it's
[53:28] something I'm willing to explore." So we
[53:30] would be kind of going and working with
[53:32] those businesses up until we found we
[53:34] find no traction or uh bad feedback from
[53:38] the from the users. This is when we can
[53:39] say let's explore something else. But
[53:41] for now this is the one that's from our
[53:43] third pivot that's working the most.
[53:47] And uh where do you see your operations
[53:50] um in the Middle East? Um any particular
[53:53] countries you're keen to expand on or
[53:55] any countries you can't expand
[53:58] into? Again, we want to get the license
[54:00] from Bahin as soon as possible. It's
[54:02] something we've been working on for the
[54:03] past 9 months. This gives us an onore
[54:06] license. An onore license allows you to
[54:08] onboard anyone from around the world.
[54:10] Our focus is obviously going to be on
[54:12] the region, but with the onore license,
[54:13] as long as you complete your KYC, your
[54:16] KYB, you'll be able to become a user of
[54:19] Zelda. Our priority is kind of you can
[54:21] divide the Middle East in two. You have
[54:23] the Gulf and you have the Levant and
[54:25] North Africa. So with the Gulf, our
[54:28] focus there is going to be working with
[54:30] Bitcoin holders and small businesses
[54:32] around custodying in Bitcoin and taking
[54:34] loans against it. There you have more
[54:36] stable local currencies. You have a lot
[54:38] of funding. You have a lot of potential
[54:40] for growth. So the small businesses
[54:42] there have the support from their
[54:44] government to be able to advance and we
[54:46] want to be there and partner with local
[54:47] banks uh people that have a lending
[54:49] license to be able to do that. This is
[54:51] kind of how we would enter that market.
[54:53] uh for the for North Africa and the
[54:54] Levant is a very different use case
[54:56] where you don't necessarily have the
[54:57] regulations and the framework. So we're
[54:59] working theres through friends and
[55:01] family connections and network to able
[55:03] to help them uh access Bitcoin. So they
[55:06] have like a lot of local currency that
[55:08] they want to convert to Bitcoin. So
[55:09] we're helping kind of like onramp them
[55:11] into that, but also we're giving them
[55:12] the chance to just take out loans and
[55:14] use it in the local market. So Egypt
[55:16] being a big enough market, that's kind
[55:17] of where we're focusing. But I think
[55:19] we're just going to have this
[55:20] two-pronged approach for now between the
[55:22] two and see where it takes us over the
[55:24] next six months. Fantastic. Do you have
[55:27] any thoughts on um uh government
[55:29] adoption of Bitcoin in the region? Have
[55:31] you heard of any uh rumors or any uh
[55:35] alpha you can share with us? I know for
[55:37] I remember a couple of months ago
[55:39] Mubadala, which is one of the largest
[55:40] sovereign wealth funds in the world, Abu
[55:42] Dhabi, one of Abu Dhabi's sovereign
[55:44] wealth funds. They announced that
[55:45] they're buying uh Bitcoin ETFs. I also
[55:48] know that this hasn't been announced
[55:50] publicly, but I know it from people who
[55:51] work in the bank in the sovereign wealth
[55:54] fund, ADQ, which is another one of the
[55:56] Abu Dhabi sovereign wealth funds.
[55:58] They've been mining Bitcoin since
[56:00] perfect timing since November 2022. It's
[56:04] around Bitcoin was at the bottom bottom
[56:07] at around 16,000 and they've mined all
[56:10] the way up until where we are now. So,
[56:13] that's clearly worked out very well for
[56:14] them. But, you know, it was a uh it was
[56:19] a way to monetize stranded energy and to
[56:21] get rid of all the excess gas. It wasn't
[56:23] specifically a Bitcoin play. So, we're
[56:26] not sure how I'm not sure how much
[56:28] they're going to be holding from that or
[56:29] if they're just going to be selling it.
[56:31] But, at least uh you know, I think uh I
[56:33] think if you mine it and you make money
[56:35] and then you see how much is it
[56:36] appreciates, that'll help you understand
[56:38] that uh hodddling is the real uh money
[56:41] here. I think even if you make money
[56:43] with mining, you make money in fiat
[56:45] terms, most miners, you'd be better off
[56:47] just buying the Bitcoin straight ahead
[56:49] and not worrying about the operation of
[56:51] the mining business. So hopefully this
[56:54] uh you know they run the numbers and
[56:55] they figure out yeah maybe we should
[56:57] have just held they're doing it at a
[56:58] small enough scale. I know for like uh
[56:59] Abu Dhabi it's like you can see it
[57:01] because Marathon Digital Assets is um
[57:03] the company they're working with. So you
[57:04] can see it on their dashboard how much
[57:06] uh the hash rate that's being done in
[57:09] Abu Dhabi. Uh the other country that I
[57:12] know has uh publicly done it but I don't
[57:14] know how I don't know details. They
[57:16] probably just created facilitated the
[57:18] framework for bitcoin adoption mining is
[57:20] because they have a lot of like natural
[57:22] energy. So they've been encouraging a
[57:24] lot of miners to come and set up shop
[57:26] there. But uh I actually can say you
[57:29] something here like we are working on a
[57:32] collaboration with uh a partner in
[57:35] Lebanon to try to get again it's a we're
[57:38] overshooting here but we're trying to
[57:40] convince the central bank to uh invest
[57:43] part of it treasury in Bitcoin. The way
[57:46] we're doing this is we're using the
[57:47] analogy of gold. So Lebanon has one of
[57:49] the largest per capita gold reserves in
[57:51] the world. Uh it's one of the top 20 uh
[57:54] countries. So that's like for a country
[57:56] that tiny and that poor to have that
[57:58] much gold reserves that's all uh stuck
[58:01] somewhere between London and New York
[58:02] and there's a lot of and Switzerland and
[58:04] there's a lot of laws about how you can
[58:05] extract it which is good because that
[58:07] meant like they couldn't liquidate all
[58:08] of that during the crisis in 2019 but
[58:11] basically that gold was bought through
[58:12] some foresight by the central bank in
[58:14] the 1960s and they kept accumulating it
[58:17] to the point where now it's worth
[58:19] something like 30 or 36 billion.
[58:23] uh the central bank's balance sheet
[58:25] today is $10 billion. Our proposal is if
[58:28] you take from that $10 billion, let's
[58:30] say 10 to 15%, so one to one to 1.5
[58:33] billion any invested in Bitcoin today,
[58:36] we based on Bitcoin's past price can
[58:39] tell you that within five to six years,
[58:41] you'd be able to make all the depositors
[58:43] that have less than $100,000 stuck in
[58:45] their account whole. So that could be
[58:47] kind of a good PR strategy or it's a
[58:48] good strategy by the central bank, by
[58:50] the new government, by the by the new
[58:52] administration to say here's a solution
[58:55] within a time frame that is reasonable
[58:58] to give back the small depositors their
[59:00] money back. If that happens, I think
[59:02] that would be kind of like I'd be very
[59:04] happy to kind of have brought value back
[59:06] and help kind of like the country just
[59:08] recover some of its assets. Obviously,
[59:10] it's very political and obviously
[59:12] sometimes these countries have bigger
[59:13] fish to fry, but we're pushing and if
[59:15] that happens, I'm sure I'll let you
[59:16] know.
[59:18] Yeah. Excellent. Um, anything else you
[59:21] want to share with us? Uh, nothing. I
[59:24] think we're going to be on zoda.me so
[59:27] anyone can subscribe. We are waiting for
[59:29] our license from Bahin, but we'll be uh
[59:33] publishing a lot more in the coming
[59:34] weeks. So, just keep an eye out. Thank
[59:36] you.
[59:38] Awesome. Well, I wish you best of luck,
[59:40] O. It's uh it's an important job. We
[59:42] need to orange pill this region, and I'm
[59:44] glad you're uh getting your hands dirty
[59:45] doing it. Thank you. Thank you. Safe.
[59:48] It's been a pleasure being with you.
[59:50] All right. Take care. Take care. Bye.
