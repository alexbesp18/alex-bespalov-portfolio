[00:00] All
[00:05] right, safe. I thought a great place to
[00:06] start this conversation is uh everyone
[00:08] knows that there's economic uncertainty
[00:10] and chaos going on in the market right
[00:11] now. Um but there's this really
[00:12] interesting idea of the US dollar being
[00:14] the leader, the king of the world. It's
[00:16] the global reserve currency. Uh you
[00:18] wrote the Bitcoin standard, kind of this
[00:19] idea that we would move from a
[00:21] dollar-based standard to a Bitcoin based
[00:22] standard. Uh, are we on the precipice of
[00:25] this happening and Bitcoin is starting
[00:26] the ascension to become that new global
[00:28] reserve currency or is it still kind of
[00:30] a ways away and we've got some time
[00:32] before you think that actually happens?
[00:34] It's a difficult question to answer
[00:35] because timing these things is very
[00:37] difficult. Um, you could say it's all
[00:39] going to look like the precipice in a
[00:41] couple hundred years. Um, but looking at
[00:45] it from here, it could take a while. So,
[00:46] it could be a while before we see this
[00:48] happen. But it is happening in a sense.
[00:50] I mean I wrote the book uh actually
[00:52] today is the yeah today's the seventh
[00:56] anniversary of the publication of the
[00:57] book realize yeah thanks so seven years
[00:59] ago I wrote the book and the price at
[01:01] that time was around $7,000 I think when
[01:03] I wrote it and now here we are it's
[01:05] $93,000 today so it's already up about
[01:07] 12 13fold in only 7 years so this I
[01:12] would say probably exceeds the
[01:14] expectations for pretty much most people
[01:16] back then most people weren't Bitcoiners
[01:18] and most people if you told them Bitcoin
[01:19] was to perform this well over the next
[01:22] seven years, they wouldn't have believed
[01:24] you. They'd have that they'd have
[01:25] thought this is insane. But here we are.
[01:28] It's going up. And I think, you know,
[01:30] it's still early days in the sense of
[01:32] just numbers because I think it's uh,
[01:35] you know, it's not it's it's not a
[01:36] matter of uh consumer adoption. It's not
[01:38] a matter of how many people download the
[01:41] uh iPhone, how many people download a
[01:43] Bitcoin app. For me, it's about the size
[01:45] of the cash balances more than the
[01:47] number of people. And so you can look at
[01:50] the size of cash balances that are in
[01:52] dollars. There are or dollars or dollar
[01:55] based currencies which are all other
[01:56] fiat currencies in the world. You've got
[01:58] around hundred trillion in fiat
[02:00] currencies. You have another hundred
[02:01] trillion in bonds and you have something
[02:04] like another 30 2030 trillion in gold
[02:07] and some other uh assets maybe real
[02:10] estate and stocks. Some of that you
[02:12] could think of as being a cash
[02:14] substitute um which Bitcoin is competing
[02:17] with. So I would say the total market
[02:19] for a monetary asset is about $300
[02:21] trillion. Bitcoin is already at 2
[02:24] trillion which is I mean impressive
[02:26] because in 15 years going from 0 to2
[02:28] trillion is the fastest that we've ever
[02:31] seen. We've never had an asset anything
[02:33] go grow this fast. So it is quite
[02:36] impressive but still got a long way to
[02:37] go. And I would say you could you you
[02:40] could say that Bitcoin is the monetary
[02:42] standard of the world when it is the
[02:46] largest of these assets probably around
[02:48] something in the range of 100 trillion
[02:50] or so. So still a while away but with
[02:54] Bitcoin you never really know how long
[02:55] it could take. You know that could be
[02:57] another few months because we've seen
[02:59] these crazy pumps in Bitcoin. But most
[03:03] likely it's not going to be a few
[03:04] months. most likely it's going to be
[03:06] several years and that's fine. I think
[03:08] uh it's it's it's a process that needs
[03:10] time. People need to accumulate cash
[03:12] balances. People need to uh become more
[03:14] familiar with how to use Bitcoin and I
[03:16] think over time it's just inevitable
[03:18] because the people who accumulate
[03:19] Bitcoin will witness the value of their
[03:20] cash balances increase whereas the
[03:22] people who don't accumulate Bitcoin will
[03:23] witness their cash balances decrease in
[03:25] value. How does the introduction of
[03:28] stable coins and their rise in
[03:29] popularity kind of change the evaluation
[03:31] in that you know Bitcoin electronic
[03:33] peer-to-peer cash? Uh I think that
[03:34] there's plenty of people who do use it
[03:35] as cash. Uh but there's more and more
[03:38] people I think that are using it as a
[03:39] store of value. And now all of a sudden
[03:40] I get the kind of digital rails, but I
[03:42] get to use the dollar. And so I think
[03:44] the United States government rightfully
[03:46] so is saying the stable coins are
[03:47] pushing US dollar global adoption. This
[03:50] is good for the dollar. Uh it'll extend
[03:52] kind of the hedgeimonyy like you know
[03:53] all the things we hear people saying.
[03:55] Does that slow down bitcoin becoming the
[03:57] global reserve currency? or actually
[03:59] because of all the global uncertainty
[04:00] and kind of geopolitical posturing,
[04:02] maybe actually people don't care whether
[04:04] it's an electronic or digital dollar,
[04:05] they're going to just abandon it and go
[04:07] for something like Bitcoin. Yeah, I I I
[04:08] can see the case uh for it strengthening
[04:12] dollar dominance for sure because it's
[04:14] allowing a lot of more people to access
[04:15] dollars and access dollars directly.
[04:17] Essentially, you buy Tether, you're
[04:19] buying an asset backed close to 100% by
[04:24] US dollar treasuries. So that's good for
[04:26] the US dollar treasuries uh because it's
[04:29] more market for them and let's face it,
[04:30] it's also good for people all over the
[04:32] world who are using that rather than
[04:34] their local currencies which are a much
[04:36] crappier um version of money backed by
[04:40] treasuries because they're getting it
[04:42] from their central bank. Their central
[04:43] bank holds treasuries, but there's a lot
[04:46] less treasury covering their central
[04:48] bank and the central bank is a lot more
[04:49] inflationary. I think a good way of
[04:50] thinking of it is just compare Tether,
[04:53] which is likely the most efficient
[04:55] company in human history. They've got
[04:57] less than 100 people working for them
[04:59] and they're making what was it 13 13
[05:01] billion I think. Yeah. Yeah. 13 billion
[05:02] from last year just profit. Yeah. For
[05:04] 100 people which is just insane. There's
[05:06] never been anything like this ever. So
[05:09] um compare that where you you're running
[05:12] they've got 150 trill billion dollars
[05:15] of stable coins around the world. Now
[05:19] compare that to the average government
[05:21] that has $150 billion of treasuries and
[05:25] or $150 billion of currency out in
[05:27] circulation. And think about their
[05:29] overhead. If you want to compare to the
[05:30] 100 people that are in Tether, you've
[05:33] got a central bank, you've got a
[05:34] government, you've got a military,
[05:35] you've got a police force, you've got
[05:37] all kinds of corruption, you've got all
[05:38] kinds of horrible things that
[05:39] governments are doing. So you're having
[05:41] to basically pay for that as a user of
[05:43] these third world currencies rather than
[05:46] um the just paying for 100 staff members
[05:49] of Tether. So it's clearly a much more
[05:51] efficient way for getting people onto
[05:52] the dollar than the rest of the world's
[05:55] currencies. And yes, it will lead to
[05:57] more demand for the dollar, but I think
[05:59] there's a case to be made that that's
[06:00] likely a little bit overstated because
[06:03] first of all, it's not really competing
[06:05] with Bitcoin. It's competing with other
[06:07] currencies that are already backed by
[06:09] the dollar. And so people say in Turkey
[06:11] or in Brazil or in um Egypt might be
[06:15] using those stable coins rather than
[06:17] using their local currency, but their
[06:18] local currency is backed by dollars. Now
[06:20] they're moving to something that's more
[06:22] efficiently and um more backed by the
[06:24] dollar. So yes, it's more demand for the
[06:27] dollar, but it's not that much demand
[06:28] for the dollar extra. And secondly, the
[06:31] dollar already has an enormous
[06:32] capitalization. The dollar is already
[06:34] the largest currency in the world. And
[06:36] so there's just not that much more for
[06:39] it to grow. So even if you think about
[06:43] the most bullish case for Tether over
[06:46] the next 10 years, you know, it grows uh
[06:49] 10x in size, it eats all of the world's
[06:53] other central banks. Even if you do
[06:55] something like that, you're still
[06:56] talking about maybe a 2x increase in
[06:59] demand for the dollar, which over 10
[07:01] years or so is not that much. I mean
[07:05] you're that's about 7% increase per year
[07:07] over 10 years and that's probably close
[07:11] to the rate of monetary inflation
[07:13] anyway. So yeah, buys the dollar some
[07:16] time, but it doesn't really change much
[07:17] of the dynamic ultimately because the
[07:20] dollar is already very big and the
[07:22] dollar the market for the dollar dollar
[07:24] is already pretty saturated and
[07:27] ultimately it doesn't change the fact
[07:28] that the inflationary forces in the US
[07:31] are likely going to eat up whatever
[07:33] extra demand there is. So the more
[07:35] people are going to buy the dollars, the
[07:36] more demand there is for treasuries,
[07:38] that's not going to reflect in more um
[07:42] appreciation in the dollar. that's going
[07:43] to reflect in more government spending,
[07:45] more US dollar spending. So therefore, I
[07:48] don't think it's that bullish for the
[07:50] dollar and I don't think it
[07:51] fundamentally alters the thesis for
[07:53] bitcoin because uh ultimately bitcoin's
[07:56] value proposition is that it continues
[07:58] to appreciate as a form of money whereas
[08:00] the dollar does not and I don't see that
[08:02] changing because of tether. It's not
[08:04] going to people are not going to be
[08:05] buying the dollar for the appreciation
[08:07] because they expect other people to be
[08:08] buying it. So ultimately I think on the
[08:11] contrary when people start using tether
[08:14] start you know when you upgrade from the
[08:16] Brazilian or Argentinian or Turkish
[08:18] currency to the um USDT backed by
[08:22] dollars it's going to make you more
[08:25] familiar with digital money make you
[08:26] more familiar with using private keys
[08:28] and public keys and then that's going to
[08:30] make you more likely to uh appreciate
[08:32] and understand the upgrade from dollars
[08:35] to Bitcoin. So, as with everything in
[08:37] this world, it's also good for Bitcoin,
[08:39] I would say. Um, what about the US
[08:42] government starting to uh hold Bitcoin
[08:44] when they say they're going to buy more.
[08:45] Um, but it does feel like when, uh, El
[08:47] Salvador, Bhutan, you some of these
[08:49] other countries, uh, I think Bitcoiners
[08:51] like, hey, that's a big deal. It's the
[08:52] first country or it's, you know, another
[08:53] country, whatever. Um, even Russia, I
[08:55] would argue, you know, they're openly
[08:56] talking about this now. Uh, but the
[08:58] United States is the United States,
[08:59] right? It feels like that was like kind
[09:00] of a big shot heard around the world.
[09:01] Um, do you think that that actually
[09:04] accelerates, you know, Bitcoin as a
[09:05] global reserve currency and it hurts the
[09:07] dollar or do you think that they've done
[09:09] it in a way where uh it definitely helps
[09:11] Bitcoin but it isn't necessarily hurting
[09:13] the dollar and people aren't losing
[09:14] faith in the dollar even though the US
[09:15] is holding Bitcoin? Yeah, it's difficult
[09:18] to tell. I mean, initially if you told
[09:20] me this a year ago, a year ago, nobody
[09:23] had expected any of this stuff in April.
[09:24] Uh, Trump was not talking about it. I
[09:26] would have thought that if at this point
[09:29] um they'd followed through with this
[09:30] strategy. would have thought it would
[09:32] have been a bigger deal. But similarly,
[09:34] you know, we we expected that the first
[09:36] corporation to buy Bitcoin was going to
[09:38] cause uh a run among corporations. We
[09:41] thought that the first government that
[09:42] buys Bitcoin was going to do that. And
[09:44] yet, you know, it's worked out well for
[09:46] El Salvador. It's worked out well for
[09:47] Micro Strategy, but there haven't been a
[09:50] lot of copycats. And I think it's um
[09:53] it's it's just the way that Bitcoin is.
[09:55] People need to take their time to really
[09:57] get it. So I'm kind of u underwhelmed by
[10:00] the response in a sense. You would have
[10:02] imagined that more countries would have
[10:03] started paying attention given that
[10:05] Trump has been uh doing this. But in a
[10:10] sense, yeah, there was a lot of talk
[10:11] about Bitcoin strategic reser reserve
[10:14] purchasing Bitcoin and so on. But
[10:16] ultimately all that has really happened
[10:17] is that they've just kept the bitcoins
[10:19] that they've had, which isn't very
[10:21] different from the policy that was being
[10:22] adopted previously cuz previously it was
[10:24] ambiguous. It wasn't clear whether they
[10:26] were going to keep them or sell them.
[10:27] And they were selling them unannounced.
[10:30] Now it's clear that they're going to
[10:31] keep them, which I think is just on a
[10:33] very simple market dynamic level is
[10:35] bullish for the price because you're not
[10:37] going to be getting a dump of 10,000
[10:39] coins on a random Tuesday morning
[10:41] without anybody finding out. Um, so I I
[10:44] I believe it's likely going to be
[10:46] bullish in the long term, but it's it's
[10:50] not clear that the administration is
[10:52] really um is really convinced of the
[10:56] idea of using Bitcoin as a strategic
[10:58] reserve or as a replacement for the
[11:00] dollar. This is the thing. So they're
[11:01] continuously saying we're going to use
[11:02] Bitcoin to enforce dollar hedgeimonyy.
[11:06] So that message has not really the
[11:09] message of dollar of bitcoin as an
[11:10] alternative is not really being pushed
[11:12] and it's um I don't particularly find
[11:15] that very convincing. I don't think you
[11:17] can use the dollar to you can use
[11:18] bitcoin to bolster the dollar. I think
[11:21] they're uh competing. It's a zero sum
[11:24] game and there is no prize for second
[11:27] place. What about gold? And gold uh did
[11:30] pretty well last year. Bitcoin did
[11:32] better. Uh but to start 2025 gold has
[11:35] done very very well. It's up like 30%
[11:36] 31%. Uh Bitcoin is uh kind of sideways
[11:40] for the most part. Um how do you look at
[11:43] that playing into the equation? I'm
[11:45] skeptical that gold can continue its
[11:47] rally significantly for a long time. I
[11:50] think the fundamental u dynamics of the
[11:53] gold market have been broken by the fact
[11:55] that gold is just not used as money in a
[11:59] practical sense. So yeah, you can hold
[12:01] it, you can buy it, you can put it under
[12:03] your mattress, you can store it in a
[12:05] financial institution, but you can't
[12:07] make payments with gold. You can't there
[12:10] are no gold banks. And so therefore,
[12:12] it's always going to be separate from
[12:14] your cash balance. It's always going to
[12:16] be separate from the money that you can
[12:17] use for settling trade. And that for me
[12:21] prevents it from appreciating
[12:22] significantly, prevents it from
[12:24] accumulating enough monetary premium.
[12:27] And I think that's why it's been used a
[12:30] lot more during the last century in
[12:31] industry. And a lot of the gold bugs
[12:34] will tell you that um you know gold it's
[12:38] good for gold that it's used in
[12:40] electronics that it's used in jewelry. I
[12:42] think that's actually very bearish for
[12:44] gold from a monetary perspective. As I
[12:46] discussed in the Bitcoin standard what
[12:47] made gold money was the fact that it has
[12:50] a very large stockpile compared to its
[12:53] uh annual production. And so this idea
[12:56] that annual production is always a small
[12:58] fraction of existing liquid stockpiles
[13:01] that are used as money is what makes it
[13:03] a great money because then if the people
[13:06] start using it more as a store of value,
[13:09] the gold miners can't increase the
[13:10] supply significantly. But if you start
[13:13] taking the liquid stockpile out, the
[13:15] gold out of the liquid stockpile and
[13:16] putting it into um industrial uses,
[13:20] you're effectively reducing the size of
[13:21] the stockpile. And therefore, the new
[13:24] production is a more significant part of
[13:26] these stock piles. And so therefore, it
[13:29] becomes more inflationary as a monetary
[13:31] asset. And that's what's been happening
[13:32] over the last century. As gold been
[13:34] demonetized, the more you see it used in
[13:36] non-monetary uses, the less of a money
[13:39] it is in a sense. and the more of an
[13:41] industrial metal it is. And that's how
[13:43] silver was demonetized. That's how
[13:44] copper and iron before that were
[13:46] demonetized. So I think this is still
[13:48] the case with gold. Even with this
[13:50] appreciation, if you look in the long
[13:52] term, I think it's not really caught up
[13:55] to dollar inflation. I don't think gold
[13:57] has held its value well compared to the
[14:00] amount of devaluation of the dollar. So
[14:01] if you were to measure the price of real
[14:03] estate in terms of gold, it's still gone
[14:05] up. Real estate has gone up in terms of
[14:07] gold in most places. And that's because
[14:10] gold has not really managed to keep up
[14:12] because it's not been acrewing monetary
[14:14] premium over time. So I'd be skeptical
[14:16] of its ability to continue to hold on to
[14:19] value for a long time as long as it's
[14:22] not possible to use gold as money. And
[14:24] it doesn't look like that's going to
[14:26] change. We don't see it happening in the
[14:28] US. We don't see it happening in any of
[14:29] the other countries that could be um
[14:32] working on an alternative monetary
[14:35] system. I you know you don't hear about
[14:38] China or India or Russia setting up gold
[14:42] payment networks, gold settlement um
[14:46] infrastructure places for settling gold
[14:48] amongst each other. The global gold
[14:51] market still relies on the London uh
[14:54] boolean association which is very
[14:57] centralized and u very shady as well. So
[15:00] there are a lot of shenanigans going on
[15:01] in the gold market. You can't verify
[15:03] gold like you can with Bitcoin. You
[15:06] can't run your own gold full node. And
[15:09] so you're always um you're always at the
[15:12] mercy of central for centralized forces.
[15:15] So I don't necessarily think that that
[15:18] has changed much. And I think this
[15:21] recent bull run, you know, it's um it's
[15:24] good for the gold bugs who have suffered
[15:28] a lot over the past couple of decades
[15:30] with uh watching pretty much everything
[15:32] go up except gold and silver. So that's
[15:35] encouraging for them, but I don't see it
[15:38] I don't see it being sustained for a
[15:40] very long time. What has to change for
[15:41] the central banks that are buying gold
[15:43] right now to start buying Bitcoin? Do
[15:45] you think I think um what they need to
[15:48] do is they if they start thinking about
[15:51] moving to a gold standard and then start
[15:54] operationally working on making gold
[15:58] trade work on an international level
[16:01] then they'll start thinking about the
[16:03] real cost of making these things happen
[16:06] and then the value proposition of
[16:07] Bitcoin will become apparent for them.
[16:09] So you actually think that the central
[16:11] banks may become more interested in
[16:12] Bitcoin by going away from fiat thinking
[16:15] about gold realizing hey this would be
[16:17] really hard and therefore we need
[16:18] something that has gold like properties
[16:20] but can be used for transactions. Yeah,
[16:22] I think if you start thinking about it
[16:24] operationally, you know, if say Russia
[16:26] and China decide that they want to start
[16:27] trading gold directly now, they need
[16:31] giant facilities for verifying it. Yeah.
[16:34] Trucks and airplanes. Then most
[16:36] importantly, I think the most the
[16:38] trickiest part of it is if you really
[16:39] want to trade gold trustlessly, there's
[16:41] no way to figure out whether this these
[16:43] giant gold bars, which are about 400
[16:45] ounces, 12 1/2 kg, there's no way to of
[16:48] knowing whether they're 100% pure gold
[16:50] or not, except melting the whole thing
[16:52] down and recasting it again. So that's
[16:55] really expensive. Every time you want to
[16:56] trade that across borders, you're going
[16:59] to have to recast it. It's a lot cheaper
[17:01] to just verify with a Bitcoin node. So I
[17:05] think, you know, the number go up
[17:06] technology in Bitcoin, the fact that
[17:07] Bitcoin appreciates a lot faster than
[17:09] gold and a lot more than gold, and the
[17:11] fact that it's a lot easier to verify.
[17:13] Those are the two things that people
[17:14] need to get. But I just uh unfortunately
[17:17] doesn't look like many people get them,
[17:18] which, you know, fortunately for you and
[17:20] me means we can stack more sets. Um the
[17:23] ETFs have come out, have been wildly
[17:25] popular, number one, you know, financial
[17:27] product ever launched on Wall Street. Um
[17:29] there seems to be more of a
[17:30] financialization of Bitcoin in the
[17:32] industry in general. Uh I always joke
[17:34] that Larry Fing from Black Rockck is now
[17:36] uh Bitcoin CMO like doing a fantastic
[17:38] job. He goes out, you know, flight to
[17:40] safety, what whatever fight to quality.
[17:42] Um isn't that positive? Like do do you
[17:45] think even though I think like the
[17:46] hardcore Bitcoiner mentality is
[17:48] self-custody, run your full node, you
[17:49] know, all the things that are kind of
[17:51] like anti-Wall Street, frankly, um but
[17:54] do we still think that they've been a
[17:55] net positive to Bitcoin in the industry?
[17:57] I think so. I'd say that they are a net
[17:59] positive. It's just more demand for
[18:01] Bitcoin, more liquidity. Ultimately,
[18:03] money is a game for cash balances and
[18:05] the bigger the cash balance, the bigger
[18:07] the liquidity and the more uh the more
[18:11] that something can function as money.
[18:12] So, you want more people to be holding
[18:15] uh Bitcoin. Yes, I would prefer if
[18:17] everybody held their own Bitcoin with
[18:19] their own private keys, but I think
[18:21] people uh you know, my fellow hardcore
[18:23] Bitcoiners, we need to recognize that
[18:25] Bitcoin is permissionless. And that
[18:26] means that you can't stop people from
[18:28] selling their u from selling IUS for
[18:32] their Bitcoin. There's no way on the
[18:34] protocol level that you could force
[18:36] people to hold their own private keys.
[18:38] They can hold their own private keys and
[18:40] then sell access to the Bitcoin without
[18:43] selling the private key. And that's just
[18:45] the way it is. So we can't stop Black
[18:48] Rockck from buying Bitcoin. We can't
[18:49] stop anybody from buying Bitcoin from
[18:51] for other people. It's inevitable and in
[18:54] and and it's just the way that the
[18:57] network scales. Let's face it, there's
[18:58] not enough room for everybody to be
[19:01] transacting on chain on Bitcoin. So,
[19:03] this is inevitable. And uh you know,
[19:05] it's it's it's important for Bitcoin
[19:08] security that it be decentralized, but
[19:11] we don't need it to be
[19:13] decentralized to the point where
[19:15] everybody's coffee transaction is
[19:17] registered on chain. We needed to be
[19:19] decentralized to the point where nobody
[19:21] can change the supply, nobody can censor
[19:23] transactions. And that's a huge
[19:26] difference. So we don't need to have uh
[19:28] a couple of trillion transactions on
[19:30] chain every day. We can do with half a
[19:34] million transactions, the most important
[19:35] half million transactions or 1 million
[19:37] transactions on chain. And that would be
[19:40] likely enough to maintain its security
[19:42] model. And ultimately, you know, all of
[19:44] the stuff about it threatening Bitcoin,
[19:47] I I don't really see it as being a very
[19:49] credible threat for the very uh simple
[19:51] reason, which is that these people
[19:52] become invested in Bitcoin. They have an
[19:54] interest in maintaining it. So,
[19:56] compromising the network is going to
[19:58] compromise their investment. So, it's
[20:01] you don't have to like Larry Frink. You
[20:02] don't have to think that he has the best
[20:04] intentions in the world, but he is out
[20:08] there looking for looking out for his
[20:10] bags. And now his bags are Bitcoin. So,
[20:12] he's going to be looking out for
[20:13] Bitcoin. Do you think that Black Rockck
[20:15] or Strategy or any of these companies
[20:18] can have too much Bitcoin?
[20:21] I don't think anybody can have too much
[20:22] Bitcoin. There's always uh everybody's
[20:24] always looking to have more. Um, you
[20:27] know, from their perspective. From their
[20:28] perspective. Yeah. Exactly. But like
[20:29] from a network standpoint, is there a
[20:31] threshold where forget who the player
[20:33] is, right? But just like if somebody had
[20:35] 10 million of the 21 million Bitcoin,
[20:37] would we be like, "Hey, that's bad that
[20:38] there's a risk there." Or doesn't matter
[20:40] how many you own, you get no
[20:41] preferential treatment in the network.
[20:43] Yeah. I mean, uh, ultimately I don't see
[20:46] how it would threaten the protocol in a
[20:49] serious sense. If you, if Michael Sailor
[20:52] ends up with 10 million bitcoins, um,
[20:54] what's he going to do? He's likely going
[20:56] to just leverage them to buy more
[20:57] Bitcoin. uh but you know that he's not
[21:01] going to wake up one day and decide all
[21:02] right let's make uh let's try and hard
[21:04] fork this so that we can add another 5
[21:07] million bitcoin to the supply so that I
[21:08] could have 15 I think if he does
[21:11] something like that would he'd be the
[21:13] biggest loser cuz his 10 million bitcoin
[21:15] would lose value so it's you know from a
[21:19] from from an egalitarian perspective it
[21:22] doesn't look nice if everybody else got
[21:25] to play um on in this game and rather
[21:29] than Michael Sailor monopolizing them
[21:31] all. But again, it's permissionless and
[21:33] um I generally have learned to try and
[21:36] not get angry at things that I can't
[21:38] control and rather focus on growing my
[21:40] own stack rather than uh looking uh at
[21:43] other people's stacks and I encourage
[21:44] everybody to have that attitude. Do you
[21:46] think that there's a net impact like a
[21:48] net negative impact by whether it's
[21:50] black I mean black rockck has more than
[21:52] strategy right and I think the ar the
[21:54] maybe the counterargument is always uh
[21:56] strategy is a company with shareholders
[21:58] technically it's like the shareholders
[21:59] bitcoin um the ETFs are made up of
[22:02] shareholders it's like their bitcoin you
[22:04] know so it's not like black rockck has
[22:05] it on their balance sheet it's only
[22:06] black rocks bitcoin but um do you think
[22:09] that there are downsides to this or do
[22:12] you just look at it as like hey there's
[22:14] some threshold that you Uh it'd be nice
[22:16] if there was more available, but at the
[22:18] end of the day, um it is just buying
[22:20] demand and that drives the price and
[22:22] that's positive. Yeah, I mean it would
[22:24] be nice. I know a lot of people uh from
[22:26] my personal life and a lot of people um
[22:29] that would just benefit from having
[22:31] bought more Bitcoin. I wrote a book
[22:33] about it. I wrote a podcast about it.
[22:35] I'm doing my best to tell all of these
[22:37] people to buy. They choose to laugh at
[22:39] me. They choose to call Bitcoin a stupid
[22:41] Ponzi scheme. And then Michael Sailor
[22:43] chooses to buy his coins. So um you know
[22:47] what ends up happening is fair because
[22:49] that's what everybody decides. Everybody
[22:51] from day one, you know, from Satoshi's
[22:53] Genesis block, everybody has had the
[22:54] same opportunity to mine or buy Bitcoin
[22:58] at the same market price or mine it at
[23:00] the same difficulty. So it's been an
[23:02] equal playing field for everybody
[23:04] everywhere from day one. And I don't
[23:07] think anybody has any grounds for
[23:08] complaint in that sense. So yeah, it
[23:11] would be nicer. Of course, it was a
[23:13] little bit more equal, but some people
[23:16] got this opportunity early on and
[23:17] figured out how to capitalize on it. But
[23:19] yeah, ultimately, as you said, um
[23:21] whether it's strategy or it's uh Black
[23:24] Rockck, it's not like Michael Slater
[23:26] himself or Larry Frink himself owns all
[23:28] of those bitcoins. They have
[23:30] shareholders who own those bitcoin or
[23:32] EDF holders who hold those bitcoins. And
[23:36] to the extent that Black Rockck and
[23:38] Strategy hold those, they hold them
[23:40] because they are doing their fiduciary
[23:42] duty to their shareholders and to the
[23:43] ETF holders in a satisfactory way. The
[23:46] moment that they start running this in a
[23:48] way that's not good for the
[23:49] shareholders, the moment that they start
[23:51] abusing that position is the moment that
[23:52] all those people sell their ETFs and go
[23:54] buy ETFs from somebody other than Black
[23:56] Rockck or they sell their Micro Strategy
[23:58] stock and they buy similar stock or they
[24:00] sell their Micro Strategy stock and buy
[24:02] Bitcoin stock. Ultimately, all of this
[24:04] stuff happens above the protocol level.
[24:07] We don't see it happening on the
[24:08] protocol level. And as you've seen
[24:11] Bitcoin kind of continue to rise up
[24:13] here, uh, one of the aspects that maybe
[24:15] I'm most fascinated by is, uh, everyone
[24:18] wanting to take the innovations from the
[24:19] altcoin market and bring it to Bitcoin.
[24:21] So, uh, things like payments, obviously,
[24:23] lightning network, very popular, uh, but
[24:25] then there's NFTTS and, you know, all
[24:27] this other stuff where it's like, hey,
[24:29] Bitcoin is going to be this layer one.
[24:30] How do you look at the Bitcoin market?
[24:32] Maybe the layer twos are side chains and
[24:34] then like the altcoin market. Are you
[24:35] still of the belief altcoins are all
[24:37] zeros? Bitcoin stuff is not really going
[24:40] to be that valuable other than just the
[24:41] layer 1 or or what? The Bitcoin Standard

[25:45] brought to you by the Daylight Computer.
[25:47] I love to work early in the morning and
[25:49] late at night or in the sun outdoors,
[25:51] but regular computer screens are
[25:52] terrible at these times, and they strain
[25:54] your eyes. For years, I've wanted a
[25:57] paper-like electronic screen on a simple
[25:59] computer I could use to write. I tried
[26:01] several models, but none were very good.
[26:04] Now, finally, Daylight have delivered a
[26:07] fantastic full function tablet with a
[26:09] paper-like screen that's easy on your
[26:11] eyes and great for outdoor use. I've
[26:14] been using the daylight computer to
[26:15] write my next book and it is absolutely
[26:18] fantastic and it has led me to invest in
[26:20] this company myself. Check out my
[26:22] interview with Andran Kata in episode
[26:26] 249. Yeah, pretty much. I think all of
[26:28] the other things that people mention uh
[26:31] are not even a rounding error because
[26:34] ultimately money is a $300 trillion
[26:38] total addressable market. This is by far
[26:40] the largest market in the world. Nothing
[26:42] comes close. Nothing. Nothing else is,
[26:45] you know, the total value of I think the
[26:47] NASDAQ is, I think, around $40 trillion.
[26:50] So the S&P 500, the 500 companies that
[26:53] make up the S&P combined are also, I
[26:55] think, around $40 trillion. So the total
[26:59] addressable market for just money is
[27:02] five or six or seven times larger than
[27:05] all of the S&P 500 companies combined.
[27:08] So that's just such an enormous
[27:12] magnitude that all of these other use
[27:14] cases, I mean, I'm skeptical that they
[27:16] going to have any kind of demand. I
[27:18] think they've been mainly used just to
[27:20] pump tokens. But even if we go along
[27:22] with all of those narratives, you know,
[27:24] um real estate on the blockchain and
[27:26] blackjack on the blockchain and um
[27:28] collectibles on the blockchain and
[27:31] Pokemon cards on the blockchain, even if
[27:33] you're going to give them all their most
[27:35] bullish scenario possible, it's still a
[27:39] rounding error next to the total
[27:40] addressable market for Bitcoin. It's for
[27:43] me it's as inconsequential as somebody
[27:45] saying, "I'm going to start painting on
[27:48] dollar bills and I'm going to start
[27:49] selling my dollar bills for more
[27:50] than$1." And so, yeah, maybe you do
[27:53] that. You know, maybe some artist in New
[27:54] York City manages to pull this off and
[27:56] start selling dollar bills for $2
[27:58] because he paints something nice on
[28:00] them. It's completely unutterly
[28:02] inconsequential to the dollar and the
[28:04] market for the dollar. It's just a a
[28:07] very very tiny little thing. And yeah,
[28:09] with altcoins, I also think it's um it
[28:12] it's it's really been a couple of rough
[28:15] years for altcoins, and I think it's
[28:17] going to continue that way. I don't see
[28:19] a compelling value acral narrative for
[28:21] any of the altcoins. um their narratives
[28:24] are um novelty, flash in the pan, short
[28:28] term, and you can get marketing behind
[28:31] it for a while, but after a while, you
[28:34] know, the supply keeps going up and
[28:36] eventually the demand can't keep up and
[28:39] then the tokens crash. And you know,
[28:42] we've got more than I think 30 million
[28:44] tokens at this point. And at least 99.9%
[28:48] of them have gone to zero already
[28:50] against Bitcoin. So, it won't be long
[28:53] before the rest go to zero as well. You
[28:55] don't think fartcoin is the future?
[28:58] I, you know, I don't make trading
[28:59] investment advice, but no.
[29:03] All right. You uh you live outside the
[29:04] United States. I think you are very well
[29:06] verssed uh in global economy, in
[29:09] monetary policy, kind of all the things
[29:10] that have made you, I think, a very
[29:12] unique voice looking at Bitcoin. Um the
[29:15] United States, we elect Donald Trump, he
[29:17] shows up, he's going to switch up this
[29:19] whole world order. Um, and I actually
[29:22] think it's important that people voted
[29:23] for that, right? People, hey, the
[29:24] America first agenda, all all of uh kind
[29:26] of what he said he was going to do, he
[29:29] is doing in theory or maybe in spirit. I
[29:32] think there's a lot of questions even
[29:33] from people who voted for him as to
[29:34] whether the way he's doing it, the way
[29:36] he's messaging it, is that the right
[29:37] path to pursue these things. Um, and
[29:39] some of it is like the actions, some of
[29:41] it's the messaging, and then some of it
[29:42] is actually like the speed, right? You
[29:45] know, I've seen people online who are
[29:46] like, "Hey, I'm cool with what you're
[29:47] doing, but just like give me six months
[29:48] to prepare my business rather than just
[29:50] do it, you know, tomorrow." Yeah. Um,
[29:52] just talk through like what is the
[29:53] perspective from outside the United
[29:55] States of what people, you know, kind of
[29:57] think is happening or or see is
[29:59] happening. Well, outside the United
[30:00] States is a very big place. So, I I I
[30:03] don't claim to be speaking for uh all uh
[30:06] 7.7 billion non-Americans out there. Uh
[30:10] but I do speak for myself and you know
[30:12] I've got plenty of perspectives to
[30:15] share. So um I mean I think the uh the u
[30:21] I personally was pretty excited about
[30:23] the whole Doge agenda initially. I
[30:25] thought that would be fun and I thought
[30:27] if Elon would bring his uh private
[30:30] sector uh razor to the government that
[30:34] would be pretty cool and I think you
[30:36] know the more drastic and the more
[30:37] painful it is the better it would be but
[30:40] I've been massively disappointed by it.
[30:42] So at the on the campaign trail, I
[30:44] remember Musk saying something like $2
[30:46] trillion reduction in government
[30:48] spending and then kept coming down and
[30:50] now we're at I think 70 billion which is
[30:53] essentially a rounding error. So um do
[30:57] you think that it is because there's not
[30:59] things to cut or like they got neutered?
[31:02] Like I was having this conversation with
[31:03] a friend, right, of um every candidate
[31:06] through my entire life has always been
[31:08] like I'm going to do and they say
[31:09] something and everyone's like yes and
[31:10] then like you got to imagine they like
[31:12] walk in the Oval Office, they get tap on
[31:13] the shoulder, they're like you're not
[31:14] going to do that, right? You know
[31:15] whether it's release some file or you
[31:17] know they get told some story or
[31:19] whatever. Like do you think that's part
[31:20] of it of like uh okay that's not good on
[31:22] the campaign trail but like you can't
[31:24] touch that group or you can't touch this
[31:26] thing. Yeah, I think I mean it's it's
[31:29] it's difficult to tell what it was in
[31:31] this case. And I thought with somebody
[31:32] like Musk, you know, he's kind of
[31:35] doesn't care. Kind of doesn't care. And
[31:36] you know what's the worst that can
[31:37] happen? He loses $50 billion. You know,
[31:39] he spent $40 billion on buying uh a meme
[31:42] website for shits and giggles. So, you
[31:45] could have imagined he would have had
[31:47] the fortitude to go along with that. And
[31:49] the fact that he hasn't is quite
[31:51] depressing, but it just confirms what,
[31:53] you know, Lynn Alden always likes to
[31:55] say, nothing stops this train. And I
[31:57] think this is uh this was an incredible
[32:00] turnaround because an enormous amount of
[32:02] expectation was placed on this and then
[32:05] it didn't quite materialize. So I'm not
[32:08] uh I'm I'm not sure, you know, behind
[32:11] the scenes how this has played out. I'm
[32:12] not sure what kind of uh uh what what
[32:16] kind of pressures came to bear but I
[32:19] think initially there was a there was a
[32:21] um initially the rhetoric was the
[32:25] government is wasteful it was very
[32:27] libertarian it was almost roughbian you
[32:29] know let's get rid of this and get rid
[32:30] of that but then it's you know it's it
[32:34] it gets watered down and now we're
[32:35] talking about individual cases of social
[32:37] security fraud and stuff like that which
[32:39] is again you know rounding errors So
[32:42] that unfortunately doesn't seem to have
[32:44] panned out. It would have been nice
[32:46] because I think you know the United
[32:47] States government is massively massively
[32:49] oversized. I think you could cut 90% of
[32:51] the United States government budget and
[32:53] you would improve pretty much everything
[32:55] particularly defense. I mean if if if
[32:58] you want to cut something you could
[32:59] bring back all US soldiers outside the
[33:02] US borders bring them into the US and
[33:05] you would actually improve US security.
[33:06] Americans would be a lot safer if that
[33:08] were the case because I think the vast
[33:10] majority of military presence abroad is
[33:13] actually making the US less safe,
[33:16] gaining more enemies for the US. So that
[33:18] would be an easy thing to cut. But of
[33:19] course, that's the one thing that not
[33:21] even Musk had even mentioned suggesting.
[33:24] And of course, you know, uh we we
[33:25] probably should have seen the writing on
[33:26] the wall. I mean, Musk himself gets a
[33:28] lot of his business contracts from
[33:31] governance. I think Twitter might be the
[33:32] least government dependent of his
[33:34] businesses, but you know, Tesla relies a
[33:36] lot on government subsidies and tax
[33:37] breaks. Starlink gets a lot of its uh
[33:41] contracts from governments. So, um if
[33:44] you really wanted to cut, you know,
[33:46] there's you you may think going to Mars
[33:48] is a great thing, but um you should be
[33:51] able to finance that with your own
[33:52] money. There's no reason that taxpayers
[33:54] and dollar holders should be financing
[33:56] that. So, that doesn't seem to have
[33:58] worked out. Then the tariffs, I think
[34:00] that was that was I believe it was a
[34:03] catastrophic mistake and I still think
[34:05] it is. I and I don't think that was an
[34:08] on the agenda. I I think if Trump had
[34:10] run with the agenda of we're going to
[34:12] put these enormous tariffs that they
[34:14] announced a couple of weeks ago, I don't
[34:16] think people would have voted for that
[34:18] on a practical sense, people would have
[34:19] just looked at their own balance sheets
[34:20] and would have said, "Oh, wow. You know,
[34:22] my laptop would have become so much more
[34:25] expensive. my um the equipment that I
[34:27] need for my business would have become
[34:28] more expensive and I think it just
[34:30] throws a lot of business models u down
[34:33] the toilet and that would didn't have
[34:35] appealed to people. I don't quite
[34:38] understand how they came along with it
[34:40] but I'm still very skeptical of it. Um
[34:43] and I think it's you know it was very
[34:46] clear the market reaction was
[34:47] devastating on the stock market but also
[34:49] on the bond market. I didn't think that
[34:50] was the big one because it seems pretty
[34:52] clear that what they thought was we're
[34:54] going to do this. it's going to be bad
[34:56] for the stocks, but if it's bad for
[34:58] stocks, that it's going to mean it's
[34:59] going to be good for bonds. And if it's
[35:01] good for bonds, that means that we can
[35:03] refinance the debt at a lower interest
[35:04] rate. Well, that didn't work out because
[35:06] the bonds went up. And I think that's u
[35:09] there was no reason to presume that that
[35:10] would be the case. Um just because
[35:13] there's generally a correlation between
[35:15] uh stocks and bonds doesn't mean that
[35:17] everything that's good that's bad for
[35:19] stocks is going to necessarily be good
[35:20] for bonds. So because of that we saw the
[35:24] bond yields rose beyond 4.5 which I
[35:27] think was the red line and when it hit
[35:29] 4.5 they backed down they give a 90 the
[35:32] day pause and then it became all about
[35:35] China and and about trying to fight with
[35:38] China some dominance play with China I
[35:41] don't think this is in any way
[35:43] productive I don't think this is good
[35:44] for the US for the American people I
[35:48] think it's u it's very wrongheaded in
[35:51] the way that they are that they're
[35:52] looking at the issue of trade as a zero-
[35:55] sum game. And it's very wrong-headed
[35:57] because they're looking at the trade
[35:58] deficit as being the fault of China when
[36:02] really China is powerless to affect the
[36:05] US trade deficit. It's exactly like you
[36:08] blaming the uh supermarket for taking
[36:12] your son's money when you gave your son
[36:14] a credit card and he goes to the
[36:15] supermarket, he goes to the mall, he
[36:17] goes to the nightclubs, he spends all of
[36:19] his money. Well, you know, these are
[36:21] just businesses. They've got price tags.
[36:23] Anybody's welcome to come and spend. And
[36:24] they can't look at your balance sheet to
[36:26] decide whether it is a responsible thing
[36:28] for you to be spending this or that.
[36:30] There are millions of Chinese businesses
[36:33] selling to Americans. And they're just
[36:35] looking at their own business. You know,
[36:37] you're selling tables to an American
[36:39] consumer. You're every single one of
[36:41] those people is just looking at their
[36:43] own business. And I'm going to sell this
[36:44] table for $500. I'm going to get $500 in
[36:47] return. They're not thinking of it in an
[36:49] aggregate sense of oh there's too many
[36:53] of us selling things that is causing the
[36:55] trade deficit. So trying to address the
[36:57] trade deficit with tariffs I believe is
[37:00] counterproductive because what's making
[37:02] the trade deficit uh grow is the fact
[37:05] that the US government can print money.
[37:08] So yes and no. I agree with you. Right.
[37:11] On one hand yes I grew from that Chinese
[37:13] business. They're just going to sell to
[37:14] whoever's going to buy. Right. It's how
[37:15] business works. The economic incentive
[37:16] is there. um if you don't agree with
[37:19] that then like you don't understand how
[37:20] you know uh kind of economics work. So I
[37:22] I agree with that point but I do think
[37:24] that there are very well doumented
[37:26] examples where um a business in China
[37:30] can sell unfettered to the US consumer
[37:33] but when the US business wants to sell
[37:35] back to China they are manipulating the
[37:38] currency they are uh hitting with
[37:40] tariffs. You know there's there's all
[37:41] kinds of things that aren't true free
[37:43] trade. And so I guess the question
[37:44] becomes um if your goal is to get back
[37:48] towards free trade where you're taking
[37:49] down those blocks you know that uh a
[37:51] foreign country has put on your
[37:53] businesses um do you agree that the
[37:56] tariffs if that's the end state are
[37:57] worth doing that uh or do you see it as
[38:01] uh it doesn't matter what they're doing
[38:03] taking the approach of the tariffs just
[38:04] doesn't make sense and you know find a
[38:06] different way to kind of address the
[38:07] issue. Yeah, definitely the second. So I
[38:10] think tariffs are essentially uh uh
[38:13] they're a punishment by the government
[38:15] to its own people primarily. So if the
[38:18] US imposes tariffs on Chinese goods, the
[38:21] main people that are hurt are the
[38:22] American consumers who rely on those
[38:24] Chinese goods and foreign goods. And the
[38:27] second uh order effect is to hurt the
[38:29] Chinese businesses. the Chinese
[38:30] businesses are hurt less than American
[38:33] consumers because Chinese businesses
[38:35] still have the entire rest of the world
[38:37] to sell to and the US is only 4% of the
[38:39] world's population and um you know they
[38:42] buy a lot of stuff though they do buy a
[38:44] lot of stuff but still uh it's no what
[38:46] is it 10% 15% of the world's it's 12% of
[38:50] China's exports which is you know it's
[38:52] the biggest importer from the from China
[38:56] but it's there's still 88% that's not
[38:59] how how much of the consumer behavior do
[39:00] you think shifts? Right? So, let's say
[39:02] uh there's a widget that's made in
[39:03] China, sold to the United States, we put
[39:05] a let's not go to 150% but you know 20%
[39:08] tariff or whatever. Um do you think that
[39:11] consumer shift and they say well if
[39:12] there's an Americanmade uh product that
[39:15] maybe is the same price or slightly
[39:16] cheaper uh that that actually can help
[39:19] the consumer but not I'm sorry hurt the
[39:21] Chinese business and help the American
[39:23] consumer. I don't think that's really
[39:25] the case. In most cases, the um the the
[39:28] the economics aren't going to be
[39:30] affected by a small little marginal
[39:32] tariff because the you know the with a
[39:37] lot of those things they're not even
[39:38] being made in the US. And ultimately the
[39:41] uh I I think the thing that is missed
[39:42] and that the econ textbook the econ
[39:44] textbook on trade does a terrible job of
[39:46] teaching trade because it oversimplifies
[39:48] it in a way that doesn't really capture
[39:50] the complexity of the real world. I
[39:53] think the uh the key thing to keep in
[39:55] mind is that the the the tariffs also
[39:59] hurt the domestic producers because they
[40:01] need to buy the imports that go into the
[40:04] produ production process. So yes, we're
[40:07] they're source materials. Yeah. The
[40:08] source materials and these things
[40:12] it's it's a very um it's a very ancient
[40:16] mentality to imagine that you can just
[40:17] have self-sufficiency. Today's supply
[40:20] chains are just so complex. I mean,
[40:22] there there's there was that meme going
[40:24] around of these I can't remember what
[40:27] fruit it was that was um grown in
[40:30] Thailand, packaged in Argentina, and
[40:33] then consumed in the US. And it sounds
[40:35] like it's insane and it sounds like it's
[40:37] wasteful, but it just ends up working
[40:39] because that's how the supply chains
[40:41] work. They've got a massive facility for
[40:44] processing these things that does them
[40:45] really well in that country and that
[40:47] facility can produce so much with their
[40:50] local product and then they realize hey
[40:53] we can start sourcing some material from
[40:54] abroad and then they sourc it and it
[40:56] makes sense and then the consumer buys
[40:58] it and even though it it might seem
[40:59] inefficient the market shows us that it
[41:01] is the most efficient way and that's
[41:03] just a very simple example of a fruit
[41:04] but of course when you get into the
[41:05] complex products TVs and electronics and
[41:08] so on you're talking about extremely
[41:10] sophisticated supply chains where it's
[41:13] very difficult for one person to be able
[41:15] to figure out how these things are made.
[41:17] So, you know, the the people at Samsung,
[41:20] they don't even know how the supply
[41:21] chain for their own TVs looks like. They
[41:24] know that they get the chips from this
[41:26] place and they get the silicon from that
[41:27] place and they get this from that, but
[41:29] they don't know how the supply chain for
[41:31] the chip that they bought was made in
[41:33] Taiwan or China or the US. And they
[41:35] can't know that. And so, every single
[41:37] person involved is involved with a tiny
[41:39] little aspect of this. And so the more
[41:42] trade barriers there are, the more
[41:45] complex this process becomes, the more
[41:47] uh expensive it becomes, and then the
[41:49] more difficult it is to compete. And so
[41:52] any country that has lowered trade
[41:54] barriers ends up having an enormous
[41:56] advantage over countries that don't
[41:58] because they are at every step in this
[42:01] production process. They can take their
[42:03] pick from all of the world's suppliers.
[42:06] So, and you can get the cheapest copper,
[42:09] the cheapest silicone, the cheapest
[42:11] anything. And when you start imposing
[42:13] those tariffs, you're basically hand um
[42:17] you're placing a handicap on the local
[42:19] producers because you're making it so
[42:20] that all right, well, we can't get the
[42:22] Chinese steel and we can't get the uh
[42:24] Canadian um maple syrup or whatever it
[42:28] is, but um you know, you can't get all
[42:32] of these different supply supplies into
[42:34] the production process. And so it makes
[42:35] it very difficult to make it
[42:37] competitively. So what you would want
[42:39] really for your own sake I think is to
[42:41] just have as little tariffs as possible.
[42:43] And I think you know the historical
[42:44] record shows this to be the case. I
[42:46] think you know people look at China and
[42:47] they say well China has some trade
[42:49] barriers. It does have some trade
[42:50] barriers now but they're a lot lower
[42:53] than what they were 40 years ago. And
[42:55] that's why China's advanced so much in
[42:57] those 40 years. And I think if they
[42:58] reduce their trade barriers further they
[43:01] would do even better. And I think this
[43:03] is this this is this is the kind of very
[43:06] destructive mentality that governments
[43:08] get into once they start thinking of
[43:09] trade as being an adversarial game that
[43:12] we're going to impoverish our people in
[43:15] order to show the Americans or we're
[43:16] going to impoverish our people in order
[43:18] to show the Chinese. It's the two
[43:20] governments essentially holding their
[43:21] own populations hostage, ruining the
[43:24] profitability of their businesses,
[43:26] increasing costs for their customers in
[43:28] order to play a game of dominance
[43:30] against each other, which is very
[43:32] dangerous because it's, you know, it's
[43:33] hurting both populations, but it's even
[43:35] more dangerous because it escalates. It
[43:37] escalates from trade tensions into
[43:39] political tensions and it can escalate
[43:41] into military tensions. And this is how
[43:44] World War II escalated. This was a big
[43:46] part of the u of the leadup to World War
[43:50] II that all these governments became a
[43:52] lot more status, a lot more centralized.
[43:55] Trade barriers went up enormously in the
[43:56] 1930s and that helped militate
[44:00] governments against each other that
[44:01] helped make people hate each other and
[44:03] prepared people for war. So, I think
[44:04] it's a very dangerous game to play. But
[44:07] um overall, I think there's nothing
[44:09] better for people in any country,
[44:11] wherever it is, to just have the option
[44:13] of being able to buy and sell from the
[44:15] rest of the world at the lowest cost
[44:17] possible. When you see these tariffs
[44:19] getting put in place, um it seems like
[44:22] that has kicked off some of the gold
[44:24] buying, that has kicked off some of the
[44:27] uh maybe conversations from foreign
[44:29] countries saying, "Okay, is the US
[44:31] trying to isolate China? Is China trying
[44:32] to isolate the US? Whose side am I on?
[44:35] is there bricks coming together and they
[44:37] want to create a currency. You know,
[44:38] there there's it almost kind of feels
[44:40] like uh there was already a lot of
[44:41] conversations and and in my opinion, a
[44:43] lot of it started with the US
[44:45] sanctioning Russia and you know, kind of
[44:48] uh showing that maybe the way that we're
[44:50] going to handle some of these situations
[44:51] is not what the global world thought and
[44:54] now tariffs are accelerating some of
[44:56] that conversation. Now, I would argue
[44:59] we're just accelerating the people to
[45:00] which side of the fight they would be on
[45:02] already, right? So people who are going
[45:03] to be allies of the US or come running
[45:04] and they say hey let's be partners we
[45:06] you know we Taiwan's a perfect example
[45:08] they need the US they want the US they
[45:09] you know want to keep doing business
[45:10] with the US their trade offer out of the
[45:13] gate very strong and it basically is
[45:15] what you're saying there's no trade
[45:16] barriers there's no any of this stuff
[45:17] like let's just be friends right but
[45:18] there's a lot of other countries that
[45:20] are saying well hold on a second uh I
[45:21] was already leaning towards you know
[45:23] China or kind of a a by um bilateral
[45:26] kind of component here and so they're
[45:28] like running towards that and so are the
[45:30] tariffs actually just like accelerating
[45:31] us more towards this world of like who's
[45:33] on whose side and and that world order,
[45:36] that capital stack getting more
[45:37] decentralized. The Bitcoin Standard

[47:03] bitcoinway.com and start bitcoining more
[47:07] confidently. I think so. And I think
[47:09] it's uh I think people in this
[47:12] administration have likely vastly
[47:14] miscalculated the um amount of economic
[47:18] influence that China has. I think a lot
[47:20] of people in the Republican party are
[47:22] influenced by um anti-Chinese sentiment.
[47:25] You know, there's an author called
[47:27] Gordon Chang who's quite influential. He
[47:29] wrote a book in 2001 talking about the
[47:31] impending collapse of the Chinese
[47:33] government and the Chinese Communist
[47:34] Party. And he said within 10 years by
[47:37] 2011 this is going to be gone. And I you
[47:40] know as a Bitcoiner I think that we
[47:42] should we we should we should notice the
[47:44] parallels here because people have been
[47:46] saying China is about to collapse for
[47:48] all of my life. You know all my life I'm
[47:50] hearing people saying China is an
[47:51] authoritarian repressive communist
[47:53] regime and it's all smoke and mirrors.
[47:56] All of their statistics are cooked up
[47:58] and it's all going to collapse. And on
[48:01] the contrary just like with Bitcoin you
[48:03] know it's not just that it hasn't
[48:04] collapsed. It's also gone up enormously.
[48:07] So you look at pictures of Shanghai
[48:08] today versus Shanghai 30 years ago. It's
[48:12] the exact opposite of a collapse. And
[48:14] you look at the pictures of small little
[48:16] towns that used to be very poor towns in
[48:18] China and now they've become industrial
[48:20] superpowers with incredible
[48:22] infrastructure. China is the world's
[48:24] leading producer of steel. It produces
[48:26] more than half of the world's steel. Its
[48:28] steel production is more than 10 times
[48:30] larger than the second largest steel
[48:32] producer which is India.
[48:34] uh China is already the prime trade
[48:36] partner for 120 countries in the world.
[48:38] So 20 years ago, the US was the prime
[48:40] trade partner for most of the world.
[48:42] Today, it's already China. And that was
[48:44] all before Trump got into office. This
[48:46] has just been the case for a while. And
[48:47] that's been the case because of China's
[48:49] growing industrialization and the US's
[48:52] de-industrialization which is driven by
[48:54] the fact that the US has a money printer
[48:56] that makes it not so um useful to get
[49:01] real productive business in the US
[49:03] because you could just go to the money
[49:04] printer. So that's why all the smart
[49:06] kids in the US want to go into
[49:07] investment and investment banking and
[49:09] hedge funds and so on. And um you know
[49:13] ultimately in a place where there's a
[49:15] big money printer, if you're good at
[49:17] your job as an engineer or as a doctor
[49:19] or as a um as an industrialist, if
[49:22] you're good at that job, but you don't
[49:25] know how to manage your investments,
[49:26] then that's pointless. It doesn't
[49:28] matter. If you get a good salary, you
[49:29] make good money, but then you don't know
[49:31] how and then you put it in a bank
[49:32] account and then you lose 7% per year,
[49:35] then it's pointless to have been a good
[49:37] engineer. So, you need to figure out how
[49:40] to play the fiat casino in order to keep
[49:42] your wealth. But if you know how to play
[49:43] the fiat casino, then it's pointless
[49:45] being an engineer also. Why would you
[49:47] want to go to engineering school, work a
[49:49] real job, go into a real factory, deal
[49:52] with actual workers when you could just
[49:54] sit in an air conditioned room and pick
[49:56] stocks and um figure out how to play the
[49:59] fiat uh market. So, naturally, everybody
[50:03] gravitates towards the fiat market. I
[50:04] think this is the fundamental driver of
[50:06] the de-industrialization in the US. It's
[50:08] the fiat money printer. And so this
[50:11] trend is um is accelerating as with the
[50:15] acceleration of the use of the fiat
[50:16] money printer. And so when the Trump
[50:18] administration says we want to increase
[50:21] dollar hegemony, we want to spread the
[50:23] dollar further. We want to use stable
[50:25] coins to make the dollar stronger as a
[50:27] global reserve currency. that is in
[50:29] direct contradiction to the goal of
[50:31] bringing back industrializ industry to
[50:34] the US. So I think the um this notion
[50:39] that China is this paper tiger that's
[50:41] going to crumble if the US places
[50:42] tariffs is vastly misplaced. I think
[50:45] China can handle uh US tariffs a lot
[50:47] better than the US can handle its own
[50:49] tariffs. And I don't even think that
[50:51] China needed to retaliate. I think if I
[50:54] was in China's place, I would have just
[50:55] completely ignored all of these tariffs
[50:57] and wouldn't have imposed anything
[50:58] myself. And I think the the u you know
[51:01] the the the people have been talking
[51:04] about this as being sort of this genius
[51:06] negotiating tactic, but you're really
[51:08] pushing people away from you as a
[51:11] negotiator if you're just willing to
[51:14] break away all those deals. I mean, this
[51:16] is the sort of thing that makes
[51:18] countries inhospitable for business.
[51:20] This is why people don't invest in uh
[51:23] basketcase countries because you know
[51:25] you you
[51:26] you can expect that whatever agreement
[51:29] you've got going with the government
[51:31] will be thrown in the dust bin once the
[51:35] next regime comes in. And so when
[51:37] there's an election in these countries
[51:39] and the president is removed the new
[51:41] president comes in everything is thrown
[51:43] out. These countries don't attract
[51:44] capital. these countries don't
[51:46] attract a lot of interest in money
[51:50] because people want stability. And so I
[51:53] think the long run impact of this tariff
[51:56] thing, whatever it happens now, whether
[51:57] they keep them, remove them, um keep
[52:00] them on some countries or whatever it
[52:01] is, the uncertainty of it all is just
[52:04] going to push everybody to try and
[52:06] reduce their dependence on the US. I
[52:08] think I think I actually think the
[52:09] uncertainty and the lack of clear
[52:11] messaging is much more of a fair
[52:13] critique than the tariffs themselves.
[52:15] Um, and if you were to critique the
[52:17] tariffs, uh, I think that the severity
[52:20] of them is something to critique. So
[52:22] it's like I've been saying from day one
[52:24] if we ended up with 5 to 10% blanket
[52:26] tariff and then we remove tariffs for
[52:28] things we want. So computers, you know,
[52:30] all all the like advanced things that we
[52:32] uh either would struggle to make in the
[52:34] United States or we already get
[52:35] elsewhere and we want to continue to
[52:36] keep those products imported into the
[52:38] US. You remove the tariffs, you turn
[52:39] tariffs into an incentive system versus
[52:41] like a punitive type system. Um I think
[52:43] that one you would accomplish the goal
[52:45] of you get more government revenue. Uh,
[52:47] two, because you're incentivizing
[52:48] certain products, you keep the things
[52:50] you want and the things that you don't
[52:51] want. People still want to sell, then
[52:53] there there's the barrier, but you it's
[52:55] kind of like you don't care about those
[52:56] things as much. Um, and then I also
[52:58] think that you can use that as an
[52:59] incentive to help some reshoring. Uh, I
[53:02] think most people agree like I saw a
[53:05] stat 75% of Americans think America's
[53:07] better off if we reshorted
[53:09] manufacturing, but only 25% of Americans
[53:11] say say they'd be better off if they
[53:13] worked in a factory. Like Americans
[53:15] don't want to go and stitch sneaker, you
[53:16] know, play do all that stuff, right?
[53:17] They want to work in high-tech advanced
[53:19] manufacturing. Like that that's good
[53:21] job, right? They want that stuff. It's
[53:22] high paying, it's high skilled, it's
[53:23] high status, whatever. Um, but I don't
[53:25] think we're going to like move back the,
[53:27] you know, uh, we're going to sew
[53:28] together t-shirts from Vietnam type
[53:30] stuff, right? Yeah. So, when I look at
[53:32] this, I say to myself, um, okay, if you
[53:35] just came out and you said, here's the
[53:36] plan. 6 months from now, it goes into
[53:39] effect, uh, and we're going to
[53:41] incentivize, we're going to do all, you
[53:42] know, blah, blah, blah, whatever. I
[53:43] think there's still some people who
[53:44] would say, "Hey, I don't like this plan.
[53:45] I don't think we should use tariffs,
[53:46] whatever." But like, okay, I got it.
[53:48] It's the it's on, it's off, it's on,
[53:50] it's off. That uncertainty has upset a
[53:54] lot of people. I think it's really uh
[53:56] showing up in the market, as you said,
[53:57] in both stocks and bonds. Um, but then
[53:59] on top of that, it's the like 150% on
[54:01] China, right? I mean, just like it it's
[54:03] not even a 20 30 40% which still would
[54:05] be incredibly high. It's like to the
[54:08] point where if I said to you, hey, we
[54:09] have 150%, you know, tariff on China,
[54:11] and they also are like ratcheting it up
[54:13] over 100%. You'd be like, stop. Like
[54:14] they you can't almost couldn't fathom
[54:16] that two years ago. Yeah. And it's just
[54:19] I mean, you know, people keep saying the
[54:21] art of the deal. The art of the deal.
[54:23] this I I'm no master negotiator myself,
[54:25] but this seems to be like the worst way
[54:28] to go about a negotiation where you
[54:30] staked out a completely unsustainable
[54:32] position, which anybody can tell that
[54:34] there's no way that you could sustain
[54:35] that and the markets called the bluff
[54:37] and the markets um started to collapse
[54:40] and forced them to back up to back down
[54:43] from this. So that shows that you're not
[54:45] very serious about this. And then if you
[54:47] started off by showing that you know you
[54:50] are that this is my pain point and I
[54:52] can't really maintain this and this is
[54:54] not a credible threat then you've really
[54:57] undermined your ability to negotiate.
[55:00] But I think more generally I mean I'll
[55:03] agree with you on this. I'll disagree
[55:04] with you that this would have been a
[55:06] preferable I I agree with you that it
[55:08] would have been preferable if this was
[55:09] done predictably but it still wouldn't
[55:11] have been good. I think it would be
[55:13] better to just get rid of all tariffs
[55:14] even the existing tariffs. that would
[55:16] have been much better for American
[55:18] industrialization. But um I I I would
[55:21] still say the um this whole idea of
[55:26] trying to use these tariffs as a way to
[55:30] negotiate for the well-being of the
[55:32] country. I just simply reject this
[55:35] overall because I think Trump is
[55:37] applying his playbook from negotiating
[55:40] for real estate deals in companies that
[55:42] he owns to negotiating for a
[55:46] government on behalf of millions of
[55:48] people's own
[55:50] businesses. And these people's positions
[55:53] are not uh all identical to each other.
[55:56] And so he's in no position to be
[55:58] determining what every single business
[56:01] needs to do. And so and and this is
[56:03] impossible for him to do that. Exactly.
[56:04] And this is this is basically from my
[56:06] perspective as an Austrian economist.
[56:08] This is what Mises calls the calculation
[56:10] problem. The reason that economic
[56:12] central planning doesn't work is that
[56:13] because you don't have property rights,
[56:16] the central planner is unable to figure
[56:18] out the correct allocation of resources
[56:21] because he has no possibility of um
[56:24] allocating things rationally because
[56:27] there are no prices. If the government
[56:28] owns all of the factors of production,
[56:30] then the government, think about, you
[56:32] know, the example of steel going into
[56:34] trains and cars. So if the government
[56:36] owns the steel mills and the raw iron
[56:40] ore uh mines and it owns the car factory
[56:44] and it owns the train factory and it
[56:46] allocates the trains and it allocates
[56:48] the cars to people and it decides how
[56:49] many people get trains and car. There's
[56:52] no way of figuring out the rational
[56:53] allocation of where should the iron go
[56:55] to which steel mill and where should the
[56:58] steel go to the cars or the trains
[57:00] because as long as it's not the consumer
[57:01] who's making the choice and then the
[57:04] entrepreneurs getting responding to
[57:06] these signals based on private property
[57:10] there's no economic calculation without
[57:11] economic calculation economic production
[57:13] falls apart that's the most important
[57:15] insight of per of perhaps the Austrian
[57:18] school and it's something that most
[57:20] people don't uh know when when people
[57:23] think about the problem of socialism
[57:24] they think of the problem of incentives
[57:26] you know people aren't going to rich in
[57:27] a so aren't going to get rich in a
[57:29] socialist system and so that's why the
[57:30] thing falls apart and that's uh
[57:33] completely separate from the mises and
[57:36] Austrian critique of socialism which is
[57:38] about property rights it's not about
[57:40] incentives the Soviet Union solved the
[57:42] problem of incentives if you didn't work
[57:43] you went to the goolag not going to the
[57:46] goolag is a stronger incentive than
[57:47] getting rich for most people so people
[57:49] had an incentive to work in the Soviet
[57:51] Union and absenteeism was not why uh the
[57:55] Soviet Union collapsed. People were
[57:57] showing up to the factories. It's just
[57:58] that the factories weren't running
[58:00] because they were missing value u
[58:02] essential inputs and those inputs were
[58:04] missing because they couldn't calculate
[58:06] the allocation of resources in in a
[58:08] rational way. So, in a sense, this is
[58:10] what trade policy is. uh it's it's less
[58:14] severe than full-on socialism because
[58:17] people still own their capital, but
[58:19] ultimately, you know, when you're
[58:20] placing 150% tariff or 20% tariff or 50%
[58:23] tariff on these businesses, you are
[58:26] completely obliterating whatever
[58:27] business model they have, everything
[58:29] changes. you know, their inputs become
[58:30] more expensive, their exports become
[58:31] more expensive, and now instead of
[58:33] focusing on their business, these people
[58:35] are having to speculate on um policy
[58:38] decisions and on market actions. So, I
[58:43] would say this is really the ultimate uh
[58:45] thing. And and I think I would say if as
[58:47] a businessman you wanted to really do
[58:49] what's better for the US, you'd let
[58:51] people have the freedom to make their
[58:53] own calculations. Mhm. when you look at
[58:56] um moving forward, if you were Trump,
[58:59] what would you do to balance, you want
[59:02] to solve these problems that he's
[59:03] outlined, um you got the tariffs already
[59:05] in place. Uh I think there's something
[59:07] about like saving face uh if you are to
[59:09] back down in any shape or form. I think
[59:11] China and many other countries have the
[59:13] same thing who've kind of ratcheted it
[59:15] up in response. Uh so you've got like a
[59:16] geopolitical, you know, kind of uh
[59:18] negotiation, if you will. Um, and then
[59:20] you also have what I would consider uh
[59:23] like the financial inputs. You got to be
[59:25] careful of the market and and kind of
[59:26] what happens there. Do you just rip the
[59:29] band-aid off in your opinion and just
[59:30] remove everything and say just kidding
[59:33] and the market rips and you don't care
[59:35] what anyone thinks about you or or what?
[59:37] Yeah, I mean I think well you know
[59:39] saving face and doing what's best for
[59:41] the market are at this point
[59:43] contradictory goals. So, um, if you if
[59:49] the concern was what's better for the
[59:50] American people, I would just get rid of
[59:52] all of these tariffs that were imposed
[59:53] in the last couple of months and just
[59:55] say, "Yeah, we're just kidding." Or just
[59:57] call it a win or, you know, find a way.
[59:59] Trust me, they will call it a win for
[60:00] sure. Yeah, for sure. I mean, just frame
[60:01] it as a sort of, yeah, we were uh we
[60:03] were just trying to show the world how
[60:04] much they need us and now we've got
[60:07] delivered the message, but uh just
[60:09] kidding. Um, we're going back to tariffs
[60:11] as they were before. that what I think
[60:13] would be best. I think well that would
[60:16] be good. What would be even better is to
[60:18] get rid of the tariffs that already
[60:20] exist to reduce tariffs even further.
[60:22] Now, if you wanted to think about the
[60:23] problem of the trade deficit, and I
[60:24] agree, the trade deficit is a problem,
[60:26] and it is a problem because it's
[60:28] sustainable for a very long time, but
[60:30] you can't sustain a trade deficit for a
[60:32] long time without going bankrupt unless
[60:35] you've got a money printer, which
[60:36] effectively, uh, which is basically why
[60:39] they have the money printer is because
[60:40] they know that they have this problem.
[60:41] And so, uh, people kind of forget they
[60:44] invented the money printer. Exactly. So,
[60:46] you know, you can't it's it's it's
[60:49] having your cake and eating it, too. We
[60:51] want to print money so that we can have
[60:53] all of the money in the world to buy all
[60:55] the things we want. But somehow we want
[60:57] to run a trade surplus. Why would you
[60:59] need a money printer if you want a trade
[61:01] surplus? A trade surplus means you're
[61:03] earning more than you're spending.
[61:06] What's the point of having a money
[61:07] printer? Like if you had a money printer
[61:08] in your basement, it would be weird for
[61:12] you to run a trade surplus, right?
[61:14] Because a trade surplus means that you
[61:15] are working in order to generate the
[61:18] money that you can print for free. It
[61:20] would be like writing books and selling
[61:22] them in exchange for pieces of paper
[61:24] that have my signature on them. But I
[61:27] can make pieces of paper with my
[61:28] signature on them for free. So it
[61:30] doesn't make sense when you've got a
[61:31] money printer. The only reason you want
[61:34] to have it is this so that you could get
[61:35] free stuff. Now getting free stuff is
[61:37] not a good thing because it's destroying
[61:39] the industrial capacity of the country.
[61:41] It's destroying the ability of people to
[61:42] work. It's destroying all the in well
[61:45] not all but it is it's not conducive to
[61:47] the growth of industry in the US. So you
[61:48] do want to fix that. And so the way to
[61:51] fix that for me is to get rid of the
[61:52] money printer. The way to fix that goes
[61:54] back to Bitcoin. So I was going to ask
[61:56] is the solution then uh go back on an
[61:58] old standard or create like a Bitcoin
[62:00] standard where you still have dollars
[62:02] backed by Bitcoin or is the only
[62:03] solution Bitcoin itself? Yeah, dollars
[62:06] backed by Bitcoin or Bitcoin is the same
[62:07] thing. I think the um you know if the US
[62:10] government wants to run a uh on a
[62:13] Bitcoin standard, I mean likely they're
[62:15] going to do it with a currency that's
[62:16] backed by Bitcoin. it's going to be like
[62:18] a second layer on Bitcoin. So, I think
[62:20] the way to do that would be to just keep
[62:21] buying Bitcoin until the value of the
[62:25] Bitcoin held by the US government is
[62:27] equal to the outstanding money supply
[62:28] and then you're able to redeem all the
[62:30] outstanding dollars for Bitcoin. So,
[62:32] currently, what's M2 at these days? I
[62:34] think 30 trillion or something like
[62:36] that. Yeah, close. Yeah. And Bitcoin is
[62:37] about $2 trillion. So, you need a 15x in
[62:41] uh Bitcoin. Oh, but no, actually, well,
[62:43] this $30 trillion, the US has about
[62:45] 200,000
[62:47] bitcoins. So, 200,000 bitcoins to $30
[62:50] trillion, you know, they keep buying. As
[62:52] they keep buying, the number of bitcoin
[62:53] that the US government holds goes up,
[62:55] but also the price of bitcoin goes up in
[62:57] dollar terms. There comes a point,
[63:00] likely it won't take long. I I presume
[63:02] in 6 months or so, if they keep buying
[63:04] eventually, there's going to be enough
[63:06] Bitcoin on the US government balance
[63:07] sheet to redeem every single dollar
[63:09] outstanding. So once that's the case,
[63:11] you back the dollar with Bitcoin and now
[63:14] the US government is on a Bitcoin
[63:15] standard and now the US government can't
[63:17] print money. So now the US government
[63:18] has to run a balanced budget and now the
[63:21] trade has to be balanced. Now there's no
[63:22] more trade deficits. You can't run trade
[63:24] deficits and you could run uh trade
[63:26] deficits for a year or two or so on, but
[63:28] it can't be held something that drags on
[63:31] sustainably for decades. Mhm. In that
[63:35] Bitcoin standard that there are dollars
[63:37] outstanding. Um what's the reason for
[63:40] the dollar? Just a just another layer of
[63:44] Bitcoin. And it's like the dollar when
[63:46] it was backed by gold. Um yeah, better
[63:50] off just getting rid of it and just
[63:51] everyone use Bitcoin.
[63:53] Yeah, you could. But I mean that would
[63:55] just mean that all of the dollar assets
[63:57] that are out there would get wiped out.
[63:59] So they'd go to zero. But I don't I
[64:03] think it would be it would make more
[64:04] sense to just just back it. Just back it
[64:06] because you know all of the financial
[64:08] institutions and all of the liabilities
[64:10] and assets that exist in dollar terms.
[64:12] Mhm. Um I mean you can't just get rid of
[64:15] all of that and scratch it all to zero.
[64:17] You can just back some of the
[64:19] Bitcoiners. They think that's for sure
[64:21] possible. Um my last question for you is
[64:24] uh around this whole theme of like where
[64:26] we are headed and um one of the areas
[64:29] I've become very interested in is uh
[64:30] humanoid robots and a lot of the uh kind
[64:33] of rise of artificial intelligence but
[64:35] not the like hey I created this little
[64:37] dinky app that you know it kind of is
[64:39] cool and shiny for a few minutes um but
[64:41] like the big systemic changes that are
[64:43] happening in society. Uh I'm of the
[64:45] belief that there's going to be, you
[64:47] know, robots in everyone's home and kind
[64:48] of all all the things that maybe are are
[64:50] hyper bullish in that space. I probably
[64:52] think it'll take longer than most people
[64:54] think, but but that's, you know, my
[64:56] worldview. Bitcoin for a long time was
[64:58] thought of as like money for machines as
[65:00] well. And it feels like a lot of the
[65:03] problems that we still are talking about
[65:04] in the Bitcoin world are like you and I
[65:06] and humans and like what we're doing.
[65:08] But it does feel like we know the
[65:10] electronic dollars of two-day settlement
[65:12] times are not going to work for the
[65:13] machines that want you know
[65:13] instantaneous uh automated payments and
[65:16] stuff like that. So do you see Bitcoin
[65:18] being that solution or do you think that
[65:20] like stable coins or something else kind
[65:22] of fulfills you know what is right now
[65:24] probably a very very small uh market but
[65:27] if that future of robotics becomes quite
[65:30] large you know that thing should really
[65:32] become a large portion of global
[65:33] transactions. I'm I'm skeptical of this
[65:36] idea that machines are going to need
[65:38] their own money to transact with one
[65:40] another because I think uh ultimately
[65:42] machines are property and so you've got
[65:44] a robot and you know you've got a
[65:47] toaster and a vacuum cleaner and a
[65:50] laptop and all these different machines.
[65:53] Um whatever they need in order to
[65:55] continue to operate is essentially
[65:59] um not monetary. you know, they need
[66:01] electricity, they need uh information,
[66:03] they need an API, they need um
[66:07] um fuel or whatever it is they require
[66:12] is going to require some kind of
[66:13] physical infrastructure in order to
[66:15] facilitate it. Now, how you monetize
[66:17] that ultimately for me, it all comes
[66:21] down to the fact that these things are
[66:22] going to be repetitive transactions. So
[66:24] this robot, this toaster, this whatever
[66:26] it is, whatever it is going to need, you
[66:29] know, when as it's interacting with the
[66:31] world, it's something that's going to be
[66:32] recurring. And so therefore, you don't
[66:34] need that thing to be constantly trading
[66:37] with the rest of the world. In the same
[66:39] way that you don't need your fridge
[66:40] currently to have its own account with
[66:44] the electric utility company, all of
[66:46] your electronics, they suck up all of
[66:48] the electricity. At the end of the
[66:49] month, you get a bill and you settle
[66:50] that bill with one transaction. So, I'm
[66:53] skeptical of this idea of money for
[66:55] robots. I think um I think to the
[66:59] basically what you're arguing is like
[67:01] they'll just use whatever money their
[67:02] owner uses. Exactly. No different than
[67:05] um Alexa from Amazon. You tell it to buy
[67:08] something, it just uses whatever credit
[67:09] cards on file. So, you think it's very
[67:11] similar? Yeah. And I think all of that
[67:14] money just wants to be one. I think this
[67:16] is one of the big misconceptions in the
[67:17] altcoin space that every time you find a
[67:20] new use case, it's going to need its own
[67:22] currency. The whole point of money is
[67:24] that it is one thing. And so money wants
[67:26] to be one and it's the same money for
[67:28] robots, for machines, for um for humans.
[67:32] Everybody wants to use the most liquid
[67:34] money. Everybody wants to use the money
[67:36] that has the highest liquidity, the most
[67:37] salailability, the one that you can sell
[67:39] at the
[67:41] uh with the least amount of slippage. So
[67:44] everything's going to, I believe, tend
[67:46] toward the one monetary asset and then
[67:49] whatever other uses that are introduced
[67:51] through technology are likely just going
[67:53] to be ways of uh managing this uh just
[67:58] just accounting essentially. I I I don't
[68:00] believe it's going to fundamentally
[68:02] alter the monetary infrastructure. It's
[68:04] just going to be a new way of
[68:05] accounting. Where can we send people to
[68:07] find uh your books, your lectures, uh
[68:10] your podcasts? Um, you know, I've
[68:12] learned an immense amount from you over
[68:14] the years. And, um, I always tell people
[68:17] that, uh, if somebody writes one book,
[68:20] they're either smart or they're crazy.
[68:23] If they write a second book, I can
[68:25] guarantee it they're a
[68:27] massochist. You've written many books at
[68:29] this point. So, like, where can we say
[68:30] people to go get all this stuff? Yeah,
[68:31] my website safeen.com. And you can find
[68:34] my books, The Bitcoin Standard, the Fiat
[68:35] Standard, and Principles of Economics.
[68:37] My third book, and coming soon, my first
[68:39] work of fiction. Oh, really? economic
[68:41] fiction. Yes. The gold standard. Um it's
[68:44] an alternative history of the 20th
[68:46] century where the world goes on a gold
[68:48] standard in the 20th century. Wow. Okay.
[68:50] Yes. And why did you want to do fiction?
[68:53] Um well, it's just something that I've
[68:54] had in my mind. Are you tired of writing
[68:55] the truth?
[68:59] It's uh it's something that I've had in
[69:00] my mind for a very long time. I've
[69:02] always thought about what the world
[69:03] would have looked like and I thought it
[69:06] would be a lot more interesting to write
[69:08] it as a kind of alternative history book
[69:11] rather than um a thought experiment
[69:14] where I sit and try and analyze those
[69:16] things. So it's written from the
[69:17] perspective of an economist writing a
[69:19] book in the year 2000 similar to my the
[69:21] Bitcoin standard but in the year 2000
[69:25] and explaining the monetary system of
[69:27] the 20th century having been run on gold
[69:30] and then how the world would have been
[69:31] uh different. So that's my next book
[69:33] coming in the next few months. It's
[69:34] running a little bit behind schedule. I
[69:36] apologize for everybody who pre-ordered
[69:39] but uh I'm on it. Amazing. All right.
[69:42] Safeodine.com. Yep. All right. Thank you
[69:44] so much for doing We'll do it again in
[69:45] the future. Cheers, man. Thank you for
[69:46] having me.
