[00:05] Hello, welcome to the Bitcoin standard
[00:06] podcast. Our guest today is Omar Harami.
[00:08] Omar is the director of the Sabil
[00:10] Ecumenical Center, a group of
[00:13] Palestinian Christians which was
[00:15] established in
[00:16] 1987 to advocate for the causes of
[00:20] Palestinian Christians. Omar was also my
[00:23] best friend in high school and him and I
[00:26] skipped school several times. I hope my
[00:28] parents aren't watching to go and play
[00:29] pool where he used to beat me usually I
[00:32] must admit. Um but I thought he would
[00:36] offer a very interesting perspective
[00:37] about life in with the West Bank for
[00:40] Palestinians and particularly for
[00:42] Palestinian Christians. So Omar nice to
[00:45] see you again. Thank you for having me.
[00:49] All right. So uh first of all tell us a
[00:52] little bit about uh who are the
[00:54] Palestinian Christians? Most people I
[00:56] would imagine don't even know that there
[00:58] are Palestinians who are Christians.
[01:01] They think Palestinians are mostly
[01:03] Muslims. Yeah, that's true. Actually,
[01:05] that's the first that's the most common
[01:07] question we encounter when I'm traveling
[01:10] or I'm on a speaking tour or when we're
[01:13] meeting um pilgrims and Christians here
[01:16] in Jerusalem and Palestine. People ask
[01:18] us like they would assume that we have
[01:20] just recently converted from Islam to
[01:23] Christianity or we're like expatriots
[01:25] living in the country some from you know
[01:29] we've just recently became Christian or
[01:32] we're recently present in Palestine. Um
[01:34] it's very interesting when people think
[01:36] about religions they think about Islam
[01:39] as an eastern religion and they think
[01:41] about Christianity as a western
[01:43] religion. Although Christianity, Islam
[01:45] and Judaism, um like many of the other
[01:48] religions also of the east started here
[01:51] in uh in this land that we call holy um
[01:54] in this part of the world. I mean,
[01:56] Christianity wasn't didn't start in the
[01:58] Bible belt in the US. It started in
[02:00] Jerusalem. And most people know this um
[02:04] but most people tend to forget about it.
[02:07] So Palestinian Christians are the
[02:09] descendants of the first
[02:12] um of the first Christians literally. I
[02:15] mean on like my family is one of the
[02:18] oldest 13 Christian families of
[02:19] Jerusalem on Pentecost. It's when the
[02:22] day that it is it's like the birth date
[02:24] of the the birthday of the church. Um
[02:28] many people became Christians and we
[02:31] know of this from the records of the
[02:33] book of act. It says that there were
[02:34] many people of different um um from
[02:37] different backgrounds. It also includes
[02:40] Arabs were also present in Jerusalem.
[02:43] Among Greeks and others, Jews and
[02:45] Gentiles and so on. But Arabs were
[02:48] present and most of the Arab most of the
[02:50] Christians of the holy land are Arabs.
[02:52] Not entirely. So we started from the
[02:54] first church and from the first century
[02:57] till this day there has been a
[02:58] continuous presence of the local church.
[03:01] So Palestinian Christians are a mosaic
[03:03] of groups. So in Christianity there's
[03:05] four, not to get into the boring
[03:07] theological language and dogmatic
[03:09] language, but Christianity is four
[03:11] families, Christian families. One is the
[03:15] Catholic Church and everybody who um
[03:18] sees the pope as their their leader um
[03:21] are considered Catholic. So it's a big
[03:23] family. It's one of the biggest
[03:24] Christian families. Then you have the
[03:27] Orthodox, the Greek Orthodox or the
[03:30] Orthodox Church. It's like um Greece, uh
[03:33] Romania,
[03:35] um Russia, Russia of course and I mean
[03:39] that is a family of its own. And then we
[03:42] have the oriental um Christians. And
[03:46] oriented doesn't mean like Chinese
[03:47] Christians means Christians from um from
[03:50] the east like the Armenian church,
[03:52] Coptic church, Assyrian church. And then
[03:55] we have the Protestant churches. Um and
[03:58] the Protestant churches, I mean it's it
[04:00] represents this family represents from
[04:02] like mainstream Anglican, Lutheran
[04:04] church all the way to evangelical um
[04:07] Pentecostal Christians. And all of the
[04:10] Christians um of the Holy Land, they
[04:12] fall into these four different
[04:14] categories. Um the biggest two
[04:17] categories are of course the Orthodox,
[04:19] the Church of the East and um and the
[04:22] Catholic Church. But all of the
[04:24] different families are represented here.

[05:31] I love to work early in the morning and
[05:32] late at night or in the sun outdoors,
[05:34] but regular computer screens are
[05:36] terrible at these times and they strain
[05:38] your eyes. For years, I've wanted a
[05:40] paper-like electronic screen on a simple
[05:43] computer I could use to write. I tried
[05:45] several models, but none were very good.
[05:47] Now, finally, Daylight have delivered a
[05:50] fantastic full function tablet with a
[05:53] paper-like screen that's easy on your
[05:55] eyes and great for outdoor use. I've
[05:58] been using the Daylight computer to
[05:59] write my next book, and it is absolutely
[06:01] fantastic, and it has led me to invest
[06:04] in this company myself. Check out my
[06:06] interview with Anjan Kata in episode
[06:08] 249.
[06:10] Yes. And the Palestinian Christians are
[06:13] the indigenous population of Palestine.
[06:16] Um and not just the Christians, but I
[06:19] mean they've they've been there since
[06:21] before Christianity. They they descended
[06:24] from people who were around before then,
[06:27] right? Yeah. You know, it is it's we
[06:29] live in an area um that is very unique.
[06:32] you know, it's uh this small piece of
[06:35] land, what we call holy land, if you
[06:37] don't want to go into the controversial
[06:39] language of saying Palestine Israel or
[06:41] Palestine Israel or historical
[06:44] Palestine, but this small strip of land
[06:46] actually connects three continents
[06:48] together. So, we are the place where we
[06:50] connect Africa with Asia and also um
[06:54] Europe is just next door. So we are um
[06:58] we are between three major continents or
[07:00] what people would refer to as the old
[07:02] world where most of the worlds have
[07:05] lived most of the kingdoms have come. So
[07:07] there were always battles happening
[07:09] armies going from one kingdom to another
[07:12] crossing through our land and many
[07:14] people became somehow many people
[07:16] settled in this land. But also we're a
[07:19] very unique piece of land because it's
[07:20] we are like we are the beginnings or a
[07:23] major part of the fertile crescent where
[07:26] actually whatever you plant grows. It's
[07:29] like you don't need to be a super
[07:30] farmer. You don't have to go to a
[07:32] podcast or see YouTube how to plant this
[07:35] specific vegetable or fruit. Whatever
[07:37] you plant grows. It's extremely fertile
[07:40] land. And this is when people started
[07:42] moved from being hunter gatherers to
[07:44] actually people who are settled who are
[07:47] able to
[07:48] plant and uh secure food and that
[07:52] allowed them more gave them more time to
[07:54] really to develop of how do we really
[07:57] develop relationships with each other?
[07:59] How can we build societies, build laws
[08:02] and also to look at the stars and ask
[08:05] questions. Why are we here? Who brought
[08:07] us here? and come with like with these
[08:09] deeper questions. So um so this land has
[08:13] always been many people wanted to settle
[08:14] in it. Many kingdoms came back and forth
[08:17] in it. I think in the last research I
[08:19] did there was like around 20 kingdoms or
[08:22] exactly 20 kingdoms and empires who
[08:24] settled in this land a part of the the
[08:27] empires that that came crossed um I mean
[08:31] passed through the land but who settled
[08:33] or built headquarters and so on. 20
[08:35] kingdoms. Amazing. And I mean many of
[08:38] them became part of the society. They
[08:41] integrated with us. So um and
[08:44] Palestinians have always I mean or
[08:46] Palestinians I mean it's actually the
[08:47] Romans who called us Palestinians or
[08:50] called this land this strip of land as
[08:52] Palestine. Um just after the destruction
[08:55] of the um of the temple 70
[08:59] AD. But anybody who lived or continues
[09:02] to live here um the word indigenous has
[09:04] like it's it's has its own implications
[09:07] but always it has been a very um it has
[09:10] been a mosaic or a combination of so
[09:12] many different civilizations. Even at
[09:15] the time of Jesus um you know it is when
[09:17] people read the Bible as a reference or
[09:19] you just look at it you find that there
[09:20] were Greeks living there were Romans
[09:22] living here there were Assyrians there
[09:24] were Egyptians there were Phoenicians
[09:27] there were canonites there were Arabs
[09:29] Samaritans Jews you know so many
[09:31] different people with so many different
[09:32] backgrounds. So the Palestinian people
[09:34] are actually a mixture of all of these
[09:36] civilizations of the people from the
[09:38] time of Jesus but also from the
[09:40] different kingdoms that have come and
[09:42] settled in our land um since um since
[09:45] the time of Christ. So we are a
[09:47] combination of so many different
[09:49] civilizations. It's actually it's very
[09:51] interesting. It's the most difficult
[09:53] place if you need a moral transplant or
[09:56] if you need like a spec um um when
[09:58] people do DNA testing it's easier you
[10:01] know it is it's they they will find
[10:03] closer relatives to them in different
[10:05] parts of the world especially in Europe
[10:07] or parts of the Middle East than in
[10:08] actually in their own village um our DNA
[10:11] is very much mixed and uh uh and and
[10:17] unique so yes we've been present since
[10:20] the first century I mean not Everybody
[10:22] became Christian. I mean the church in
[10:24] Palestine became went through so many
[10:27] different uh stages. The first stage
[10:30] which is I mean we know this from the
[10:32] Bible. Um the first thing is was this
[10:35] controversial group of followers of
[10:37] Jesus. So many of them were Jews. Not
[10:39] all of them but the majority of them
[10:40] were from Jewish backgrounds and when
[10:43] they became Christian it wasn't really
[10:46] Judaism. So they were Jews and you know
[10:48] they continued to pray in synagogues and
[10:51] to um to to read um Hebrew scriptures
[10:56] and to have to keep and to maintain the
[10:58] Jewish tradition. But there was
[11:00] something um extra. They believed in
[11:03] this
[11:04] controversial person who was you know
[11:07] Jesus was controversial on so many
[11:09] different levels. He was controversial
[11:11] because he was bringing some different
[11:13] teachings. He wasn't unique in his age
[11:15] because I mean not only he was saying
[11:17] that I was um the Messiah, others said
[11:20] that they were the Messiah but he was a
[11:22] person who was very charismatic and was
[11:24] able to gather thousands tens of
[11:27] thousands with him um just to listen to
[11:29] his sermons and you know this land was
[11:31] living on we were living under military
[11:34] occupation. The Romans were not the best
[11:36] uh rulers of the world. They were good
[11:39] but I mean they were they brought
[11:41] technologies, they brought
[11:44] um
[11:46] um philosophy, they brought so many
[11:48] things they introduced for in our region
[11:51] but they were also known to be very
[11:53] brutal um like most empires and most
[11:56] occupations and at that time of Jesus
[11:58] you know you can gather you know it is
[12:00] you can imagine you know it is there
[12:02] this charismatic person who gathers tens
[12:04] of thousands of people and they're
[12:06] willing to listen to him and you know
[12:08] it's they're willing to march and follow
[12:10] with him on Palm Sunday or on different
[12:13] um occasions. It's it was a problem for
[12:15] the rulers of the land but also it was
[12:18] also problematic with with the dogma um
[12:22] in Christian dogma Jesus has two natures
[12:24] has a divine nature and has a human
[12:26] nature and this is blasphemy um for um
[12:29] in Judaism because for like Jews and I
[12:32] would say also this is like a
[12:34] problematic also for Muslims for for
[12:36] most people you know it is God is one
[12:39] simple one unique you know Christians we
[12:42] we have this Jesus with two natures. We
[12:45] have the trinity complicated. We have
[12:47] the these practices that doesn't make
[12:49] sense to to many um to many people who
[12:52] are outside the Christian tradition. So
[12:55] it was the first persecution or the
[12:57] first problems the early church found
[12:59] was actually within the Jewish community
[13:01] that they so that those people have lost
[13:03] their mind and they're doing something
[13:04] crazy. Then later on Christianity grew
[13:07] very fast mainly among the people in um
[13:10] in the Middle East but especially in our
[13:13] land and they became a bigger problem
[13:16] for the Romans and this is when the
[13:18] Roman persecution started um to the
[13:20] church. So the first challenges were
[13:22] persecution of the Jews um to the early
[13:26] church. Then you had the the persecution
[13:28] of the Roman
[13:30] Empire to the um to the Christians. Um
[13:34] then you had another encounter that
[13:36] really affected us which was actually
[13:38] the internal dogmatic problems that
[13:40] started among Christians. Is Jesus one
[13:43] nature, two natures? You know it is it's
[13:46] trying to understand understand the
[13:48] nature of Christ and so on. And this
[13:49] created some debates in some of the
[13:51] churches and this is when our oriental
[13:53] brothers and sisters oriental Christians
[13:55] broke away. the cops, the Ethiopians,
[13:57] the Armenians, the Syrians, they said,
[14:00] you know, what uh you guys are talking
[14:02] about is doesn't make sense. And they
[14:03] broke away from the main church. And
[14:06] that was a time of where Christians
[14:08] persecuted Christians, both Palestinian
[14:10] Christians, but it was part of the
[14:12] problem. Then we had another new
[14:14] encounter. Of course, we had the Persian
[14:17] occupation. Persian at that time when
[14:19] the Persians came and occupied Palestine
[14:22] um in um in the fifth sixth century this
[14:27] was in the sixth century this was a
[14:30] major sixth seventh century early 7th
[14:32] century this was a major um blow for
[14:35] Palestinian Christians or Christians in
[14:37] the east in general because the Persians
[14:39] were extremely violent when they came
[14:41] they demolished most of the churches
[14:43] they killed most of the monks burnt all
[14:45] of the books it was really like a
[14:47] disaster It was like an ethnic
[14:48] cleansing. It was massacres. Um the only
[14:52] church that remained standing at that
[14:53] time was actually the church of the
[14:55] nativity in Bethlehem because it's
[14:57] there's this story in the um the
[15:00] Christmas story with the ma with the
[15:01] magi coming and you know offering gifts
[15:04] to Jesus and they're from the east and
[15:07] they were dressed in Persian clothes and
[15:09] when they saw them they saw their
[15:11] picture on the church they thought that
[15:13] this was a place holy for um for
[15:16] Persians or it had um it had a
[15:19] connection with the Persians and nobody
[15:20] destroyed it. But it was a terrible
[15:22] massacre. There was a massacre in
[15:24] Jerusalem where 50,000 40 to 50,000
[15:26] Christians were killed um in it um
[15:29] around the old city walls. No, and that
[15:33] was a big um problem for Palestinian
[15:36] Christians or Christianity in the east
[15:37] in general because at that time there
[15:39] wasn't this logic of nationalism. Then
[15:42] was again the coming of Islam and the
[15:44] coming of Islam, you know, it was for
[15:46] the first time a part of the Persian
[15:48] occupation which which lasted shortly.
[15:51] It was the first time that the people of
[15:53] the land um had a diff had a king or
[15:57] rulers who were not from the same
[15:59] religion and this really affected u you
[16:02] know it's the privileges or the freedoms
[16:04] of the local Christians. It wasn't
[16:06] terrible. I mean there's this encounter
[16:09] that we we we learn about in history and
[16:12] in our textbooks about the encounter of
[16:14] the patriarch of Jerusalem Sophronius
[16:16] with
[16:17] Omar and you know Omar Omar is a name of
[16:20] I mean he's a khif is um is the second
[16:25] um khiff in Islam and he's like a very
[16:29] wellrespectable um person in Palestinian
[16:32] Christianity in in Christianity in the
[16:34] east because he was known of a person to
[16:37] be really just and fair and the
[16:39] relationship was really good or I mean
[16:42] it is it's of course even to the
[16:44] standards of today relationships were
[16:46] good between Muslims and Christians and
[16:49] actually that's why you're called Oman
[16:51] right yes yes I I mean it's one of the
[16:53] different uh reasons um but yeah that's
[16:56] that's one of the stories my grandfather
[16:58] was it's a common name among Christians
[16:59] in Palestine not I mean it's a common
[17:01] it's not unusual to have it for example
[17:04] in Egypt they wouldn't have Omar name
[17:06] and so on. But in Palestine, we are like
[17:09] I mean it is um when it comes to
[17:11] Palestinian I'll get to this later on
[17:13] but I mean there's a very unique
[17:15] relationship between Palestinian Muslims
[17:17] and Christians and actually according to
[17:19] the people who were like you know
[17:20] according to the manuscripts to to
[17:23] history until actually the coming of the
[17:26] crusades 95 90% of the of the land was
[17:29] Christian. So I mean it is Islam was
[17:31] came and the majority of the land was
[17:34] Christians. Of course there has been
[17:36] some you know um rebellions,
[17:39] revolutions. There has been some areas
[17:41] where the people of the land have uh
[17:43] rose against the leaders of the land. Um
[17:47] and I mean it is it's there has been
[17:49] some frictions here and there. We're not
[17:52] saying that things are always a utopian
[17:54] but they were not you know as at least
[17:56] how most people would imagine. They
[17:58] think when they think of the east and um
[18:01] the relationship between Islam and
[18:02] Christians, they think about it it's
[18:04] mainly like through the lens of Syria
[18:06] and ISIS and Iraq and so on. That's not
[18:08] the case. Um but until the coming of the
[18:12] the crusaders that was a big challenge
[18:15] and we as Palestinian Christians that
[18:17] was the next serious challenge for us.
[18:19] The first challenge for us is because
[18:21] that's the first time that it I mean the
[18:23] coming of the Catholic Church or the
[18:25] crusaders had two main implications for
[18:28] us. The first implication that this came
[18:30] after the the major schism between the
[18:33] church when the church got divided
[18:35] between east and west um the orthodox
[18:37] church and the catholic church. So when
[18:39] the crusaders came here, I mean they
[18:42] started massacring the Jews in Europe
[18:44] before even they reached um to um to the
[18:46] east and then eventually also of course
[18:49] they had allies but they um within the
[18:52] eastern church but also there was a
[18:54] persecution. They burnt
[18:56] Constantinople. Um they burnt um major
[18:59] um um cities, Christian cities on their
[19:02] way. And even in in the east, as I said,
[19:05] most of the land was Christian, Lebanon,
[19:07] Syria and so on. And that created a big
[19:10] problem. They've even like when they
[19:12] came and they occupied Jerusalem,
[19:14] um they massacred Jews, Muslims, and
[19:17] Christians all along.
[19:19] um um mainly but mainly Muslims and Jews
[19:22] but they killed everybody and they
[19:23] actually made it illegal for Christian
[19:25] leaders from the eastern church to be um
[19:29] to be present in Jerusalem. They exiled
[19:31] them to to Cyprus and to um to to to
[19:35] other parts outside and they brought in
[19:37] the Catholic church and the Catholic
[19:39] church became the dominant church. So
[19:42] that was a damage for us. And
[19:44] incidentally, a lot of the Palestinian
[19:46] Christians fought against the crusaders
[19:48] at that time, right? I mean it is its
[19:51] history is I mean there has been more
[19:52] than five crusades or six crusades. I
[19:55] don't know how you count them. I mean
[19:56] some people count up to nine crusades.
[19:59] So most of the times you know it is it
[20:01] wasn't like within usually you know
[20:03] kingdoms come rulers come and go and
[20:05] usually people outside you know there
[20:07] isn't like civil disobedience that takes
[20:10] place but yes in many cases yes many
[20:12] people fought alongside um um um the
[20:17] people of the land especially when they
[20:19] saw the massacres that the crusaders
[20:21] were doing against the Christians of the
[20:23] land. I mean the crusaders also fought
[20:25] with each other and also crusaders had
[20:28] alliances with the Muslims against other
[20:30] Muslims and you know it's a whole it's
[20:32] complicated you know most people you
[20:34] know it is it's sadly most people who
[20:36] get their history from Netflix you know
[20:38] it is for them it's it's easy um history
[20:42] is easy they get um they get the message
[20:45] easy you know or they look for like a
[20:47] one minute or they ask you know um chat
[20:50] GPT you know this is where they get
[20:52] their information But actually many
[20:54] people who are like really like they do
[20:56] a lot of time um reading books, arguing
[21:00] and debating. So it's not a simple
[21:01] history. Um I mean there were Christians
[21:05] and Muslims fighting also Christians and
[21:07] Muslims um during the time of the
[21:09] crusades. So that's like I mean with how
[21:11] the alliances are. It's exactly like
[21:13] with what's happening now in the Middle
[21:14] East. You know you have Israel has
[21:17] alliances with Arabic with Arab
[21:19] countries. Many Israeli Jews stand with
[21:21] the Palestinians. you know it's the
[21:23] world is very
[21:24] complicated but um you know after the
[21:27] crusades the understanding I would say
[21:30] between the um between the Muslim world
[21:32] and the Christian world became um um um
[21:38] we encountered like serious changes and
[21:41] I mean at that time of course the church
[21:44] the western church and um Islam became
[21:47] enemies and this had its effects on the
[21:50] local Christians because Some people
[21:52] thought that you know it is it's they
[21:54] got really worried and this is when the
[21:56] demographics of the the Christians
[21:58] started to change. So from the time of
[22:00] the crusaders before the crusaders it
[22:02] was let's say 90% as low maybe as 85% as
[22:06] high as 95% it started going gradually
[22:10] um down um after the crusaders but after
[22:14] the crusaders you know the second
[22:16] problem that we had as Palestinian
[22:18] Christians and you know it's you need
[22:20] like 10 podcasts for the crusaders if we
[22:23] want to talk about them I don't know if
[22:24] I'm the the right person to talk about
[22:26] them I know a little bit but um But they
[22:29] could be like an it's a very interesting
[22:31] topic. Um or maybe some of your viewers
[22:34] would find them interesting. But then
[22:36] there was like a time when the Ottoman
[22:38] or the Muslim leaders made peace with
[22:40] the Christian
[22:42] West and it was uh again they made peace
[22:46] to fight also the Christian East. So
[22:48] that was like that's politics um uh the
[22:52] dirty politics and then it was the time
[22:56] for the Christian church in the west to
[22:58] come to the holy land you know and the
[23:00] holy land is important because this is
[23:02] like this is where Christianity started.
[23:04] It started in Bethlehem and Jerusalem.
[23:06] It started this is I mean Jerusalem is
[23:08] Bethlehem is the is where the Christmas
[23:09] story takes place. Jerusalem is where um
[23:13] um I mean it is it's uh it's the city of
[23:15] the resurrection, the city of Pentecost.
[23:17] the city of ascension. Um the first
[23:20] church was in Jerusalem or is still in
[23:23] um in Jerusalem. So um so everybody had
[23:27] like everybody thinks about it, you
[23:29] know, it's like how in the US, you know,
[23:30] wherever you go and you see like a
[23:32] McDonald's, you have to have a Burger
[23:33] King next to it. It's like part of the
[23:36] competition. And the same thing in
[23:37] Jerusalem, everybody wants to have a
[23:39] branch in Jerusalem.
[23:42] And when um the Christian West came into
[23:45] Jerusalem, instead of really advocating
[23:47] to support the local church, they
[23:50] started to to they started three
[23:53] important projects in their view. One
[23:56] project is that they wanted to convert
[23:57] the Jews who were in the land to become
[23:59] Christian. Um and I mean that wasn't
[24:03] very successful. Then they started a
[24:05] project to convert the Muslims to
[24:06] becoming Christians. That was also not
[24:09] um um successful. And then they started
[24:11] to make Christians to um you know um to
[24:15] to convince Christians to move from one
[24:17] denomination to another. So at that time
[24:20] you know serious friction started
[24:22] competition challenges between the local
[24:24] Christians and keeping in mind that it
[24:27] is it at this time the the local
[24:30] churches had local leadership. So Palest
[24:32] it was like I mean at that time it
[24:34] wasn't like Palestinian the word that
[24:35] you would use Palestinian but people who
[24:37] were born brought up in the east were
[24:40] the ones who be who became the leaders.
[24:42] If you go to to the US, you expect that
[24:46] the church leader there or the church
[24:48] leaders would actually be Americans, not
[24:51] Canadians, not people from Latin
[24:52] America, not people from Africa,
[24:55] especially people who come, you know, it
[24:57] is most of the um it's because of the
[24:59] different deals the Ottomans did with
[25:02] the churches in the west. They gave them
[25:06] the positions of Jerusalem out of you
[25:08] know um um for certain deals
[25:12] transactions I would say and since that
[25:14] time to today most of our church leaders
[25:17] we have like 13 traditional churches in
[25:18] Jerusalem only 11 and only in the last
[25:22] 50 years they have a Palestinian
[25:23] leadership or a leadership that even
[25:25] speaks Arabic. They are either Greek,
[25:28] um, Romanian, um, Armenian, not
[25:31] Palestinian, Armenian, Italian, as I
[25:34] said, um, Russian. Uh, so there are
[25:37] people who do not understand our
[25:38] language, were not brought up, um, in
[25:41] Palestine, um, do not understand the
[25:43] culture. For them, some of the people
[25:46] they come and for them like Islam is uh,
[25:48] is a foreign um, religion to them. they
[25:51] don't understand the culture or the the
[25:53] beauty of the ecumenical relations that
[25:55] we have. So from that time it they they
[25:58] um it was a major challenge. It it it
[26:00] broke it fragmented the Palestinian
[26:03] Christian
[26:05] community. And I mean it is and the last
[26:08] or I would say that um and the last um
[26:12] major historical incident that really
[26:14] affected the presence of the Palestinian
[26:16] Christians was actually the neckb. I
[26:19] mean neckbay is I mean it is it's 1948
[26:23] um for people in who are aware about um
[26:27] who are familiar with our region there's
[26:29] two different narratives for Israel 1948
[26:33] um the month of May is a month of
[26:36] celebrations you know um Jews after
[26:39] being so many years in the diaspora
[26:42] suffering as a minority facing
[26:44] anti-semitism and so on now they have a
[26:47] country on their
[26:49] And um it's a year of celebration
[26:52] especially after the Holocaust for us as
[26:54] Palestinian Christians. It was a
[26:56] catastrophe. This is the literal meaning
[26:58] of Nakbi catastrophe because it it ended
[27:01] up with the destruction of twothirds of
[27:03] Palestine
[27:04] um Palestinian villages and towns.
[27:06] Twothirds of our people became refugees.
[27:09] And I mean it is not all of us but many
[27:12] of us acknowledge I mean that um Jews
[27:15] have suffered in the west and they are
[27:17] victims and especially after the horrors
[27:19] of uh the Holocaust but honestly it
[27:22] doesn't really help us to be victims of
[27:24] victims you know in the US now with when
[27:27] you listen to or in Europe and so on you
[27:30] know when people I mean even though that
[27:31] they recognize that many of them um
[27:33] immigrants and the refugees they come
[27:35] from broken countries their lives are in
[27:37] danger but it doesn't really help them.
[27:40] Everybody has their own domestic issues,
[27:41] their internal issues. And we
[27:43] Palestinians are exactly like this. We
[27:46] were very much worried with the coming
[27:48] of uh hundreds of thousands of refugees,
[27:51] especially that there was already this
[27:54] declaration and Zionist conferences that
[27:56] were saying, "Oh, now it's we need to
[27:58] find a country to start a country. Um a
[28:02] country um will be established." So we
[28:06] felt very much threatened and that was
[28:08] the case and I mean many of our people
[28:11] resisted this uh um this Zionist project
[28:15] or the establishment of the state of
[28:16] Israel and together with our Arab
[28:19] countries we got uh we lost and this
[28:22] resulted with losing twothirds of our
[28:25] land and two/3s of our people becoming
[28:27] refugees some refugees in neighboring
[28:29] countries mainly Lebanon, Syria, Jordan
[28:31] and Egypt among others but also a big
[28:35] portion of our people became
[28:37] um internally internal refugees whether
[28:40] inside what became the state of Israel
[28:42] or within um the West Bank and Gaza
[28:44] which were under the Jordanian and the
[28:47] Egyptian mandate. So it created a new
[28:51] like you know we slept um we slept in a
[28:54] country where all people lived in it
[28:56] were Palestinians, Christians, Muslims
[28:58] and Jews and we woke up in a country
[29:01] that we became divided in so many
[29:03] different categories.

[30:37] few details here about the 1948, which
[30:40] is that initially it started in 1947
[30:44] when um the Israeli paramilitary groups
[30:47] started ethnically cleansing entire
[30:49] villages. Israeli at that time. I mean
[30:51] because the state of Israel was not it
[30:53] was like more like Jewish Zionist
[30:55] militias. Yes. And they were terrorist
[30:57] organizations at that point. They uh
[30:59] deliberately and openly and publicly and
[31:01] proudly targeted civilians both in the
[31:04] villages that they wanted to expel but
[31:05] also in the cities where they wanted to
[31:08] uh where they blew up bombs in Yafa and
[31:10] Hifa and several places um targeting
[31:15] civilians as well as British
[31:17] installments to try and get the British
[31:18] out but also Palestinian civilians and
[31:20] also killing some Jewish civilians in
[31:22] many cases. But it was a terror campaign
[31:25] and it was um it was a culmination of a
[31:27] project that had been going on for five
[31:30] decades. Um people say that people
[31:34] generally think that this was a that the
[31:36] establishment of Israel was a result of
[31:38] the persecution of uh Jews in Europe in
[31:41] the late 1930s and in the ' 40s. But the
[31:44] Zionism had already been established
[31:46] many decades before that. and it it had
[31:49] the bell for declaration supporting it
[31:51] in 1917 which is the British government
[31:54] saying that they want to establish a
[31:55] Jewish national homeland. So as you can
[31:58] imagine this was not popular with people
[32:00] who weren't Jewish in that land who had
[32:03] lived there for centuries and millennia
[32:05] before because nobody wants to be uh
[32:09] nobody wants to have somebody else's
[32:10] ethnostate established over their
[32:12] land. And in time the worst fears came
[32:16] true because what was established in
[32:18] 1948 you know first of all there was the
[32:20] terrorism that started in 1947 and 48
[32:22] targeting um the expulsion of
[32:24] Palestinians from Palestinian cities and
[32:26] villages but also after
[32:29] 1948 first of all the refugees were not
[32:31] allowed to return to their property and
[32:33] I think perhaps even more
[32:35] importantly and most people don't know
[32:38] this Israel doesn't have a private
[32:41] property system in its prop in its land.
[32:43] And so, uh, the vast majority of land
[32:47] that Israel controls, the vast majority
[32:48] of territory under Israeli sovereignty
[32:50] is owned by the Israeli government, by
[32:52] the Israeli land authority. More than
[32:54] 90% of the land by the Jewish National
[32:57] Fund. Yeah, of course. By the Yeah. Not
[33:00] not by the government, by a fund. I
[33:02] mean, the Jewish National Fund. Yeah.
[33:05] But it's it's a quasi It's a
[33:06] governmental organization effectively.
[33:08] And it does not allow that land to be
[33:11] sold to anybody, but it only leases it.
[33:15] It only leases that land and it only
[33:16] leases the land to people from one
[33:18] religion, from only from one religious
[33:20] group. So, a lot of people will usually
[33:23] say things like, "Well, Palestinians
[33:24] just need to get over it. They lost the
[33:25] war and they need to get over it." First
[33:28] of all, the majority of Palestinians
[33:29] have gotten over it. The majority of
[33:31] Palestinians have left Palestine and um
[33:34] they they've effectively gotten over it.
[33:35] They've gotten other passports. They
[33:37] live in other places, but the ones that
[33:40] are left can't get over it because it's
[33:43] not just that you lost the war. It's
[33:45] that you are not allowed to have
[33:47] property and you're constantly having
[33:48] your property seized. I mean, it's it's
[33:51] even more complicated safe. I mean, it's
[33:53] part of it is Yes, I agree. I mean, it
[33:55] is it's in in in medieval times, you
[33:58] know, it is it's or at least um before
[34:01] 1945. I mean, that's the logic of the
[34:04] world. If you're the if you're a if
[34:06] you're you're you're
[34:07] you're the ruling government or you're
[34:10] you're you're the powerful, you know, it
[34:12] is it's you go to war and you know it's
[34:14] who wins wins. You take the land, you
[34:16] take the property, you take the gold,
[34:18] you can also take but that's that's not
[34:21] true because I mean in Palestine in
[34:23] particular it's not true. You know when
[34:24] when Omar Kab came Omar Kab came to
[34:27] Jerusalem in
[34:29] 637 he did not take away the property of
[34:33] the people who were living there. He did
[34:35] not kick out the Christians or the Jews.
[34:37] In fact he brought back the Jews to
[34:39] Jerusalem because Jerusale Jews had been
[34:41] expelled from the Roman Empire. And so
[34:44] from that point onward there had been a
[34:48] modern uh perhaps Jews have been
[34:51] expelled at that time because I mean it
[34:53] is of the allegations that Jews have
[34:55] participated or have supported the
[34:57] Persian occupation. Um no Jews were
[35:00] expelled by the Romans at that time.
[35:02] Yes. And at that time it was the
[35:03] Byzantian government I mean empire that
[35:05] has ruled the land. And I mean it is
[35:08] it's but I mean it is it's it's but the
[35:11] rule the law of of war in in I mean
[35:15] throughout history is who wins takes the
[35:18] land who who dictates the rules and does
[35:20] whatever um they see fit. So that's how
[35:23] it is. But after World War II a new
[35:27] system you know countries came and they
[35:30] said look we're not stupid. You know we
[35:32] had World War I 20 people around 20
[35:35] million people died. We had World War
[35:37] II, 60 million people died, maybe more.
[35:39] We had 80 million people died. That's a
[35:41] huge number. We are we are supposed to
[35:44] be realistic, rational, civilized. Let's
[35:47] find a way to deal with problems among
[35:49] ourselves. And they created, you know,
[35:51] this system, not a perfect system, maybe
[35:55] definitely a broken system, but a system
[35:57] at least to avoid the world slipping
[36:00] into nuclear wars. especially that you
[36:02] know we have nuclear wars and the last
[36:04] thing that we want is to start a war
[36:06] that everybody dies in it and the
[36:08] cockroach wins. Nobody wants the
[36:10] cockroach to win. And everybody, you
[36:12] know, most people are good people. I
[36:13] believe the majority of the people,
[36:15] we're good people. Everybody wants, you
[36:17] know, it's it's already their, you know,
[36:18] they're trying to make a living. They're
[36:20] trying to to build relationships, take
[36:23] care of their kids, their families, and
[36:24] so on. And, you know, the logic of
[36:27] inter, you know, finding ways and rules
[36:29] that would govern nations is a is a
[36:32] realistic. It's a good, you know, maybe
[36:33] it's a bit naive for us to believe that
[36:35] this is a system that is for everyone,
[36:38] but it's definitely a system that has
[36:39] been working for a number of decades.
[36:41] Maybe we have avoided going into world
[36:43] wars from that time because of this
[36:46] system. You know, I think I if you'll
[36:49] allow me to disagree a little bit here,
[36:51] I think historically when u you know
[36:54] what had been happening in wars in
[36:56] Europe over the past few centuries is
[36:59] that increasingly the wars were becoming
[37:01] uh more civilized and that they were
[37:04] fought by professional armies in
[37:05] battlefield and they were fought over
[37:08] control of territories but not over a
[37:10] change in the private ownership of the
[37:12] territories. So you were living in a
[37:15] city u and the German and the French
[37:18] militaries would fight over the city.
[37:20] The residents of the city would remain
[37:21] in that city and the only thing that
[37:23] changes is the flag of the king and the
[37:27] taxation that that needs to be paid and
[37:30] who who you pay the taxes to. But wars
[37:33] increasingly in the civilized societies
[37:35] respect property rights. And it's not
[37:39] because of this. There's I mean the
[37:40] Geneva conventions there's some rules
[37:42] that have done because even war has
[37:45] rules and laws you know what you're
[37:47] supposed how do you treat your prisoners
[37:49] how do you treat um civilians um you
[37:53] know it is it's you know every even war
[37:56] should have rules and people have
[37:58] decided that if it's rules wars don't
[38:00] have uh rules then it becomes we might
[38:03] end up you know it's going into like
[38:06] very dangerous areas where genocide
[38:08] becomes legalized is um you know it is
[38:11] it's becomes like we're not able to
[38:13] control the behavior of people. I mean
[38:15] in the past there were rules maybe
[38:17] governed by by people of conscience good
[38:20] leader righteous leaders by religion by
[38:24] you know by by certain ethics you know
[38:27] um but I mean it is it's there there
[38:29] wasn't like something a rule that was
[38:31] like countries came together and signed
[38:33] agreements on made Geneva conventions of
[38:37] how we should treat each other now it's
[38:39] the world I mean and it's a good thing
[38:41] the world I mean it is it's have or most
[38:43] civilians of the world do not remember
[38:46] you know living going through a war. I
[38:49] mean except of certain you know um and
[38:52] previously Yugoslavia you know we have a
[38:54] war in Sudan we have you know we have so
[38:56] many um areas of conflict but it is for
[39:00] most people like at least in Europe a
[39:02] part of the Russian Ukrainian war or in
[39:05] the US civilians haven't encountered war
[39:08] they have a different memory of a war
[39:10] than um than their soldiers and their
[39:13] armies who go you know who travel to go
[39:16] to a different um context tenant or you
[39:19] know um to a different country to fight
[39:21] the
[39:22] wars but we need rules for war. Not
[39:26] always people will abide with them but
[39:28] there needs to be a reference that this
[39:30] is acceptable and this is not
[39:31] acceptable. This constitutes a war
[39:33] crime. This is a crime against humanity
[39:36] that we believe that as civilized people
[39:38] that we can agree to a minimum behavior
[39:41] of how do we act? Children should not be
[39:44] targeted. um um women should not be um
[39:48] become sex slaves. We we have it doesn't
[39:51] mean that it doesn't happen. It does
[39:53] happen but in less numbers um than it
[39:56] used to be um used to be a common
[39:58] practice um in war.
[40:02] Yeah. Although I think um I I agree with
[40:05] you in broad terms, but I would say that
[40:08] this is there's probably been a little
[40:10] bit too much emphasis on these
[40:11] international treaties as helping
[40:13] achieve this because I would say that if
[40:16] you look at the history of the 19th
[40:17] century, you see that war was becoming
[40:19] less and less common. And in fact, it
[40:21] was the move towards stronger
[40:23] governments. And um I in in my work the
[40:27] way that I explained it was primarily
[40:29] the fact that they went off the gold
[40:31] standard and now they could print money
[40:33] that resulted in a lot more wars and a
[40:36] lot more wars lead to a lot more
[40:37] catastrophes and a lot of bad things
[40:39] happening. These kind of modern treaties
[40:42] I don't think help as much as having the
[40:46] guarantee of governments not having uh
[40:48] money printers. If they don't have the
[40:50] money printer then it's harder for them.
[40:53] But yeah, I agree with you. Without the
[40:55] money printer, these norms become much
[40:58] easier to enforce and they start
[40:59] emerging naturally. And I think this is
[41:02] what we were seeing in the 19th century.
[41:03] The 19th century was relatively more
[41:05] peaceful than the 20th century. And it
[41:07] continued a 19th century had its own war
[41:10] declining violence. So if you look at
[41:12] 16th, 17th, 18th, 19th century, the
[41:15] death number of people dying from
[41:16] violence was declining per percent as a
[41:19] percentage of the population. and then
[41:20] in the 20th century it goes back up
[41:23] again. But yeah, we broadly agree. Yeah,
[41:26] that's not my um um you know, it's I
[41:31] haven't done the needed research there.
[41:33] I don't know if I want to, but I mean
[41:35] it's a good uh topic to to look into.
[41:39] All right. So, we got to 1948 and then
[41:41] what happened? Then you disrupted me.
[41:44] You you distracted me. Well, you've been
[41:46] talking for the whole day, so I need to
[41:48] get uh I I I need Yeah, I thought like
[41:51] my part was very interesting. I don't
[41:52] know what about you, but um but I mean
[41:54] it is so you had this issue and you know
[41:57] it is it's as I said we grew you know we
[41:59] went to sleep as one uh as members of
[42:03] one Palestinian people and we woke up to
[42:05] to different realities. So you know it
[42:08] is although this is like we Palestinians
[42:09] are like around 12 15 million
[42:13] um um 15 million people and we're
[42:16] divided in so many different categories
[42:18] you know it's there's everybody has
[42:20] their own concerns their own context so
[42:23] I the terminology that I use that you
[42:26] know and I mean when I say
[42:28] Palestinians you know most people are um
[42:31] Palestinians doesn't mean um mean Arab
[42:34] most of us are Arabs but we have
[42:36] different ethnicities among us. So we
[42:38] have Armenians, we have gypsies, we have
[42:41] people from the Afrop Palestinian
[42:43] community, we have people who are
[42:44] actually Kurdish, we have people who are
[42:47] um from Russian background, we have
[42:50] people from the Indian community from
[42:52] India. They have come and they've we
[42:55] have Greeks, we have Italians. This is
[42:57] still we know we very much know where we
[42:59] come from. It's part of our oral
[43:01] history, part of our culture. But we all
[43:04] Palestinians, you know, whether we're
[43:06] Christian, Muslim, Jewish, Samaritan,
[43:09] Bahi, Ahmedi. Um, but mainly most of the
[43:12] Palestinians are um are Muslims. Um,
[43:16] there's a good percentage of Christians.
[43:18] I mean, Christians are like around 10%
[43:20] of the Palestinians in the diaspora, but
[43:22] locally, we are less than 1% living in
[43:24] the Holy Land. Um and until recently, I
[43:28] mean now it's like a handful of uh Jews
[43:30] who refer who identify as Jewish
[43:33] Palestinians, but even the Israeli
[43:35] society is divided between two major
[43:37] groups. Half of the population
[43:40] approximately comes Jews from the
[43:43] western um countries mainly Europe,
[43:46] North America and the other half
[43:48] actually come from the Middle East. you
[43:50] know, there's like there's uh North
[43:53] Africa, Arab countries. They come from
[43:55] Syria, Lebanon, um Yemen. There's still
[43:58] some um Arab Jews or Jews who refer to
[44:01] themselves as Arabs. So, it's two at
[44:03] least two major groups um who live um in
[44:07] Israel, but for us as Palestinians,
[44:09] we're a very diverse group. And we
[44:12] became it actually depending to which
[44:14] geographical location that you were in,
[44:17] you became a certain category of
[44:19] Palestinians. So the Palestinians who
[44:21] remained in what became the state of
[44:23] Israel, they're around 20% of the
[44:25] population now. Um um around 2 million
[44:29] people today who live inside Israel, who
[44:31] are Palestinians, but citizens of
[44:33] Israel. So they have an Israeli passport
[44:37] and they enjoy some laws. It's not a
[44:40] democracy, at least according to human
[44:42] rights organizations. You know, there's
[44:44] like six state Israel doesn't have a
[44:45] constitution like the US. It's more like
[44:47] the UK where they have basic clues. So,
[44:50] there's 64 basic laws um that actually
[44:54] give Jewish citizens a better standing
[44:58] or more rights than non-Jewish citizens.
[45:01] And when I say non-Jewish citizens, I
[45:03] mean mainly the Arab citizens of the
[45:05] state of Israel. Then we have the group
[45:08] of Palestinians who live in in East
[45:12] Jerusalem. So we're part of the West
[45:14] Bank, but we are we have became like
[45:17] green card holders um inside um the
[45:20] state of Israel. Israel came took over
[45:23] East Jerusalem and said this is part of
[45:25] Israel. So the people you become uh um
[45:29] you don't become citizens but you become
[45:31] like temporary residents. So it's a
[45:33] green card. So it's it's a it's almost
[45:36] an annual exercise that we need to go
[45:38] and to prove that the central of life
[45:40] for us is in East Jerusalem. Then you
[45:42] have the Palestinians in the West Bank.
[45:44] And the West Bank is divided into three
[45:46] categories. Palestinians who live in
[45:48] cities and they're mainly governed by
[45:49] the PA. So the Palestinian Authority is
[45:52] the one that collects the garbage and
[45:54] provides security and that's like 15% of
[45:56] the West Bank. Then you have like 30%
[46:00] which is uh area B which is Palestinian
[46:02] villages. I'm generalizing here. Um, and
[46:05] area C, which is most of the West Bank,
[46:08] um, it is like the bread basket of
[46:11] Palestine. Um, it is there's less than
[46:14] 100,000 Palestinians who live in it and
[46:17] it is both security and administrative
[46:22] responsibilities are for the Israeli
[46:24] government um, the Israeli occupation.
[46:26] Then we have Gaza, which is Gaza
[46:29] is its own um, its own case. Um but I
[46:34] mean it's 2.5 million people who live in
[46:36] Gaza and now it is it's actually
[46:40] um the situation in Gaza needs a whole
[46:41] session but everybody's aware about it.
[46:44] So Palestinian Christians live in every
[46:46] community that I have mentioned in and
[46:49] their their daily challenges are not
[46:51] very different from the challenges of
[46:52] the Muslims or even the Samaritans who
[46:55] live in Palestine. So in one way we're
[46:57] all Palestinians. Um, and it depends on
[47:00] which category you belong to. If you're
[47:03] living inside Israel or you're living
[47:04] inside East Jerusalem or you're living
[47:06] in West Bank area A, B, and C or you're
[47:09] living in Gaza, you face different
[47:11] challenges. Of course, it's not easy
[47:13] being a minority. You know, minorities
[47:14] are always like it's a big
[47:17] responsibility to be a minority because
[47:20] minorities are always invested and
[47:22] interested to make sure that the
[47:24] societies that they live in are
[47:26] democratic. they share certain ethics
[47:28] that allow um the the weaker the people
[47:32] on the margins um you know um to be able
[47:36] to thrive and to act normally and um and
[47:39] that's why mostly like most of the
[47:41] Palestinian
[47:43] um civil uh civil society
[47:46] organizations people who work on really
[47:49] trying to promote um a culture of
[47:52] tolerance and support you know they
[47:54] always have a connection in one way or
[47:56] another to either Palestinian Christians
[47:58] or to churches
[48:00] um who are trying to really advocate for
[48:04] for improving the societies and you
[48:06] improve them in in promoting specific
[48:08] values. A value is justice. Justice is
[48:10] important. You know the rule of law but
[48:13] for law to be applied it has to be a law
[48:15] that doesn't differentiate between one
[48:18] group of people and another. And that's
[48:20] why what we refer to as upper tide or um
[48:23] which is a legal term or I mean the
[48:26] discrimination inside Israel um um or
[48:29] the occupied territories is a major
[48:31] concern for all Palestinians but
[48:32] specifically as Palestinian Christians.
[48:35] You know it's not nice to be a secondass
[48:37] or third class citizen when you have
[48:39] like 64 basic laws discriminating
[48:42] against you. Yeah. And I think it's um
[48:45] it's um I think the important thing to
[48:47] keep in mind here is that it's not just
[48:48] any random law. It's not some small uh
[48:52] benefits that you get. It's the most
[48:54] fundamental thing that a human being
[48:56] needs. Yeah. And these are the basic
[48:57] laws. I mean these are the basic laws.
[49:00] When you say it is who is entitled to
[49:02] get land from the government, if you say
[49:04] that this is one Yeah. So that Yeah. No,
[49:07] it's actually that's not the number one
[49:09] uh law. The number one law is actually
[49:12] like the number one law for any society,
[49:16] for any country. The number one law is
[49:19] the right for
[49:21] citizenship. You know, that is the the
[49:23] that's the basic right. So if I I'm in
[49:25] the if I'm in the US, you know, if I'm
[49:28] visiting um my American friend in the
[49:30] US, let's say, you know, the first right
[49:34] for me is like they ask me if I'm not a
[49:36] US citizen, I'm not entitled for the
[49:37] same rights as an a US citizen. it it's
[49:40] an American country. Um it's uh it's
[49:43] protected by a constitution. I mean
[49:45] definitely the US has its own values. It
[49:48] has its own systems that defend
[49:50] everybody. I'm not saying that I will be
[49:52] abused for not being an American, but I
[49:54] will have access for my rights and the
[49:56] freedom to practice the freedom of
[49:58] speech, maybe to carry arms. Um whatever
[50:02] laws and important points are in the US,
[50:05] I'll have access to them if I'm a part
[50:07] of the citizenship. And actually in
[50:09] Israel, it's the the only citizenship
[50:12] nationality that I you are not allowed
[50:15] to put on your passport or on your paper
[50:17] document and it's been a case in courts
[50:19] for decades is actually you're not
[50:21] allowed to put
[50:22] Israeli. So you can write Palestinian,
[50:25] Arab as nationalism, you can put Jewish
[50:27] definitely, you can put Swedish, you can
[50:30] put Russian, you can put Ethiopian, you
[50:32] can put Muslim, you can put whatever you
[50:34] want. You know, you can make up your own
[50:36] nationality, but you're not allowed to
[50:38] put um under nationality Israeli. It's a
[50:41] major issue because I mean it is the
[50:44] moment that you are allowed to apply
[50:46] for, you know, then it becomes a city
[50:48] for a country for all of its Israeli
[50:50] citizens. But it's not. Israel passed
[50:52] the law that it is a country, it's a
[50:54] state for its Jewish
[50:57] um citizens. And actually the Arab
[51:00] lists, you know, it's Arabs inside
[51:01] Israel, half of them run for the
[51:03] Kineset. Others, they say, "This is BS.
[51:06] We're not going to run for it. This is
[51:08] only just, you know, it's not real
[51:09] democracy." But regardless, the people
[51:11] who run into the Kineset, they're
[51:12] members of Kineset. They run and every
[51:15] year they propose a law and it's called
[51:18] the law that Israel is the country for
[51:20] all of its citizens. That's the call.
[51:22] That's called the that the citizen law
[51:24] and each year it gets rejected by the by
[51:27] the kineset. Um they're not able to get
[51:30] votes for people to endorse this which
[51:32] is should be making sense. You know if
[51:34] somebody comes and says the US is a
[51:35] country for all of its citizens makes
[51:37] sense. You know nobody should object for
[51:39] it. You don't actually need the law.
[51:41] This should be part of your and I mean
[51:43] um the Arab citizens of Israel their
[51:45] political parties are very smart. They
[51:48] know that this is not going to be
[51:49] approved. But in a way to to expose that
[51:51] Israel is not a democratic state. You
[51:54] know it's fine. I mean all of the Arab
[51:55] world is not a democratic state. Many
[51:58] countries around the world are really
[51:59] not democratic. You know it's it's
[52:01] democratic. We don't feel that you know
[52:03] this is a virtue in everyone. But also
[52:06] many of our Arab countries do not for
[52:08] example identify themselves as
[52:11] democratic states. I don't think any of
[52:13] them. Also, I think I think democracy
[52:15] here is honestly my uh we I'm sure you
[52:18] disagree, but I I think democracy here
[52:19] is not the relevant metric because it's
[52:22] not in my opinion. I'm not a fan of
[52:24] democracy and I'm not ashamed to say it.
[52:25] I don't think democracy is a good thing.
[52:27] What I think is important, what I think
[52:28] is a good thing is property rights. And
[52:30] the problem with Israel being a state
[52:33] that is not a state for all of its
[52:35] citizens is that it discriminates based
[52:39] on it discriminates property ownership
[52:42] based on uh ethnicity or religion or
[52:45] whatever criteria that they choose uh to
[52:47] follow. But this has serious implication
[52:49] because this was a state that was
[52:51] established essentially for a foreign
[52:53] population. So if you look at the
[52:55] population of Palestine, not a foreign
[52:57] population entirely, not entirely a
[52:59] foreign population. No, because because
[53:00] because the right of return, excuse me,
[53:03] hang on. Because the right of return
[53:04] allows people from abroad who have no
[53:06] connection to Palestine, who have no
[53:08] link there, no relatives, nothing,
[53:11] who've never been there. If they claim
[53:13] to be Jewish, then they can substantiate
[53:15] that claim in whatever criteria the uh
[53:17] government follows. They can go to uh
[53:21] Israel and get property from the state
[53:24] and they can take that property which
[53:26] you as yes you can lease it but you as a
[53:29] Christian or a Muslim who is an Israeli
[53:32] citizen cannot get that property and so
[53:34] that property most of the property most
[53:36] of the land is earmarked for Jews and
[53:38] the majority of Jews are not Israeli.
[53:41] the majority of Jews are outside of
[53:42] Israel. So Palestinians who've lived on
[53:45] that land for centuries get that land
[53:48] stolen from them and they can't buy it
[53:50] back or they can't lease it back.
[53:51] Whereas foreigners are given the land at
[53:55] subsidized rates even if they have no
[53:57] link to it. So for accuracy because I
[54:00] said we are divided into different
[54:02] categories. So when we're talking about
[54:04] Palestinians living inside Israel with
[54:07] or or hold an Israeli um you know
[54:10] passports, their citizenship is Israeli
[54:13] but um I mean when their nationality is
[54:16] different which doesn't make sense. I
[54:18] mean if you're in the US and your
[54:19] citizenship is is American, your
[54:22] nationality is American. Makes sense. In
[54:24] Israel, no nationality and citizenship
[54:26] are two different things. So when we
[54:28] speak about the discrimination that's
[54:30] taking place inside the state of Israel,
[54:32] we're talking about for all citizens,
[54:33] people who hold Israeli passports, they
[54:36] they um they adhere or I mean it is it's
[54:39] they are governed they're governed by
[54:41] different laws and rules and you know it
[54:43] is it's the the you know it's when you
[54:45] talk about you know property land
[54:47] property rights I mean I I disagree with
[54:50] you because it's the main the main the
[54:52] main uh issue for you it's even if you
[54:55] have the right you know to own land. But
[54:58] if your neighbor has the right to come
[54:59] and carry a gun and tell you, you know,
[55:01] and to kick you off the land, it doesn't
[55:02] really help if you paid for this land.
[55:04] You got evicted from the land. That's
[55:06] what I mean by property rights. You
[55:07] don't have the property rights because
[55:09] the neighbor can kick you out because he
[55:10] is from the right religion and you're
[55:12] not.
[55:14] I mean it is rights. Yes. But I mean
[55:18] also like this is like from a legal
[55:20] perspective not all not exactly accurate
[55:23] because I mean it is when Israel came
[55:26] they have confiscated or they have
[55:28] labeled most of the land of what became
[55:30] the state of Israel as nation land and
[55:33] they gave this land they gave this land
[55:36] under the property of the Jewish
[55:37] national fund and they are the ones who
[55:39] distribute it and makes sense I mean at
[55:41] least it doesn't make sense to me or to
[55:43] you or I hope to most of your uh viewers
[55:46] or listeners
[55:48] But it's the logic of it is that this
[55:50] land became, you know, if it's a Jewish,
[55:52] this is the land for the Jews and then
[55:54] Jews should be the ones who are entitled
[55:55] to benefit from it. For them, they see
[55:58] another their their Palestinian neighbor
[56:00] or their Israeli neighbor who's not
[56:02] Jewish as a Canadian or as a Mexican or
[56:05] as a as a German or as a Russian. They
[56:08] do not see that this person has
[56:10] ownership over the land or the right to
[56:12] own the land. And this is only
[56:14] applicable and these are the the lucky
[56:16] ones who live inside the state of
[56:17] Israel. Now we who live in East
[56:19] Jerusalem, we are temporary residents,
[56:22] not only the land, the land which
[56:23] doesn't make sense because they have
[56:25] this law of the um present absentee. You
[56:29] know, it's present is present and
[56:30] absentee is absentee. How could you have
[56:32] a law that says present absentee law?
[56:34] You know, it doesn't make any sense. But
[56:36] of course when you're trying to to
[56:38] manipulate or to twist rules because
[56:41] laws were made to to enforce
[56:44] justice or I mean it is its values that
[56:47] we we believe like in democratic
[56:48] societies you know it's that you know
[56:51] democracy I think it shouldn't be like I
[56:53] I I think everybody should be part of
[56:54] democracy um supporting democracy
[56:57] because it's democracy is gives us the
[56:59] right to practice what it gives us the
[57:02] right to be different from the system
[57:04] from the government or from and the
[57:06] people who are in powerful. It allows
[57:08] people to be different from us without
[57:10] fearing to go into prison or to jail or
[57:12] to be silenced. It's you're able to
[57:15] critique, you're able to have a podcast,
[57:17] you're able to have um to educate
[57:19] people, to raise the attention of the
[57:21] people. So, I think it's I mean, and
[57:23] that's only one part of democratic
[57:24] values um that I I I support and I
[57:27] encourage. Um but anyways, but that's
[57:30] not the topic. I I just want to say that
[57:32] it is it's in East Jerusalem. We're not
[57:34] even we do not have the privilege to
[57:36] have uh to to be under the um under the
[57:40] same laws that discriminate against us
[57:43] in our basic laws. We are like we become
[57:46] residents temporary residents in our own
[57:48] country while just for not providing a
[57:51] specific paper or for having um um for
[57:55] suspecting that the center of life for
[57:57] us is not in Jerusalem. It's actually
[57:59] like 2 kilometers away from Jerusalem.
[58:01] we can get evicted and lose our rights.
[58:03] Now the people in the West Bank, they
[58:05] live under military rule law. So it's
[58:08] it's very you know for people not for
[58:10] most people who haven't visited the
[58:12] country or do not understand it. So
[58:14] let's say I'm a Palestinian Christian.
[58:15] I'm driving I'm driving from Ramla to to
[58:20] to Jerusalem and on the road I encounter
[58:23] an Israeli um an Israeli um um car. No,
[58:29] no, no, not even a car. an Israeli car
[58:31] citizen, maybe another like a doctor, an
[58:34] Israeli doctor who's going also with his
[58:36] family on vacation and we have a car
[58:38] accident, may God forbid. So, it's very
[58:42] interesting because it's and we we go
[58:43] out and we argue and we say, "Okay, we
[58:46] do not agree whose fault it is. I
[58:48] believe it's his fault. He believes it's
[58:49] my fault." Very interesting. He picks up
[58:52] the because at that time you call the
[58:54] police, right? So he calls the Israeli
[58:57] police and the Israeli police comes with
[58:59] civil you know with in in a you know a
[59:02] police comes. If I call the police I
[59:05] cannot call the police. I will have to
[59:07] call the military police and the
[59:09] military vehicle comes. So the Israeli
[59:12] is governed by Israeli law, civil law,
[59:15] which is like it's I have to say it is
[59:17] if you're an Israeli Jew, um this law is
[59:20] very like progressive, very um um you
[59:23] know, defends freedoms. It's similar to
[59:25] the laws in the US or in Germany or
[59:28] Sweden or Norway. And I mean and he
[59:32] would be have his rights. He can go to
[59:34] court. He can, you know, get the phone
[59:36] number or the badge number of the
[59:38] policeman. If I if um the military army
[59:42] comes, I can be arrested without any
[59:45] reason. I they can if they don't like
[59:46] how I um how I speak to the military or
[59:49] if I disagree with their with their
[59:51] opinion, I can go for 6 months
[59:52] administrative detention. So two cars
[59:55] got in a car accident, we live in two
[59:57] different ways. And this is why we use
[59:58] the word apertise. It's not like South
[60:00] Africa apparite but it means that two
[60:02] people in the same land in the same area
[60:05] in the same context one is governed by a
[60:07] specific set of laws and the others set
[60:09] by a specific clause you know in some
[60:11] areas in Hebron for example where it's a
[60:13] mixed city or some parts of it is a
[60:15] mixed city you sometimes have fights
[60:17] between two kids the Palestinian and the
[60:19] Jewish kid the Jewish Israeli kid you
[60:21] know how kids they fight for whatever
[60:23] reason they fight over you know one
[60:25] likes basketball one likes baseball one
[60:27] likes
[60:29] um hamburgers, the other one likes hot
[60:31] dogs. They fight the the Israeli police
[60:34] comes and they need to if they're
[60:36] speaking with the with the Israeli kid,
[60:38] they cannot speak with him unless his
[60:39] parents are present, a lawyer is
[60:41] present, they cannot they cannot take
[60:43] him immediately to to the police
[60:45] station. They need to um sum him up at a
[60:48] time that doesn't is not at night, at a
[60:50] time that he doesn't have school and so
[60:52] on. While the Palestinian kid, he gets
[60:54] kicked, thrown in a military jeep, maybe
[60:58] like left um in a jeep, and I'm saying
[61:00] things that are documented by
[61:02] respectable organizations, and get
[61:03] thrown into a military jeep and spends
[61:06] maybe like three nights without having
[61:08] access to a bathroom or a um a special
[61:12] sleeping mat or so on. And when he's
[61:15] asked questions, um there's no lawyer
[61:18] present. His parents are not even aware
[61:20] where he is. That's the system that we
[61:22] live in. And even though this is more
[61:26] privileged people than who the ones who
[61:27] are living in Gaza um or or living in a
[61:31] refugee keep camp in the West Bank. So
[61:33] there's a hierarchy of of uh you know
[61:36] it's Palestinians um Palestinians are
[61:39] like different categories. We're talking
[61:41] about if a piece of land I don't know
[61:42] how to compare it. It's if most of your
[61:44] audience is from the US um I mean the I
[61:48] mean it's it's the size of New Jersey.
[61:51] Yeah. Yeah. It's it's very easy. All of
[61:53] Palestine. All of Palestine. The West
[61:54] Bank is about a fifth of that. Yeah.
[61:57] It's one/ird of that, I would say. So,
[61:59] yeah. All of historical Palestine. All
[62:02] of Palestine.
[62:04] It's 20 West Bank and Gaza is like 27%
[62:08] of the West Bank of uh I mean um I think
[62:12] that's that's the more accurate. So,
[62:14] it's like one/ird or less than one/3.
[62:16] Maybe two. I think maybe. Maybe.
[62:20] Yeah. Um, so I mean it's we're talking
[62:24] about a very small piece of land. It's
[62:26] just, you know, you're you get
[62:28] overwhelmed and that's I I mean that's
[62:30] part of it. It's like when I get like
[62:32] delegations, we lead delegations here
[62:34] just to show that we say that the best
[62:36] way is for you to come and see and we
[62:39] lead people and you know I used to get
[62:41] offended when people sleep in the bus
[62:42] you know they get overwhelmed from me
[62:44] speaking all the time. It's good that
[62:46] it's actually it's we have a record that
[62:48] you haven't fallen asleep
[62:50] safe but usually people fall asleep
[62:53] people get tired they really do not they
[62:55] feel overwhelmed and they feel that this
[62:57] is too complicated it's not this is um
[63:00] this is a case of one group of people
[63:02] you know regardless of what their
[63:03] narrative is if they believe God gave
[63:05] them this land they feel because they're
[63:07] entitled because of uh they are victims
[63:09] of the world all of this I I I don't
[63:12] want to argue these cases but they
[63:14] believe that whatever they say they have
[63:15] the right to come to another piece of
[63:17] land and to dis dispossess these people.
[63:21] Of course, you cannot dispossess people
[63:22] unless you dehumanize them because it's
[63:25] not like, you know, it is you have to
[63:26] show that these people are dangerous.
[63:28] And for us Palestinians, you know, you
[63:31] know, you're Palestinian, I'm
[63:32] Palestinian. I would say most of us
[63:34] Palestinians are really nice. Um, some
[63:36] of us even have some good sense of
[63:38] humor. We're very hospitable. You know,
[63:40] it is it's we like to enjoy our siestas.
[63:42] We like to drink coffee. We like to talk
[63:44] about irrelevant issues, you know. Um we
[63:48] we like, you know, it is it's we admire
[63:50] other cultures. Um we when we see a
[63:52] foreigner, we like to build bridges to,
[63:55] you know, to exchange
[63:57] um contact information. So like we're a
[64:00] very hospitable simple people and you
[64:03] know it is it's in one way or another
[64:05] you know they they have been able to use
[64:08] the Palestinian to dehumanize the
[64:10] Palestinians and the Palestinians became
[64:12] villains. They became the devils of the
[64:14] world. We all became the people who are
[64:18] like irrational. But you know what does
[64:20] it mean that we are irrational? We're a
[64:21] group of people who are trying to stay
[64:22] in our villages. We're trying to have
[64:24] access to drinking water. We're trying
[64:26] to go to school without harassments. We
[64:29] don't like our land to be confiscated.
[64:31] We'd like to be, you know, to to start
[64:33] our businesses and not to rely on u um
[64:38] or or do not want to submit um to people
[64:41] telling us how to live our lives we want
[64:43] to live to marry the people that we want
[64:45] to marry um to visit the people we want
[64:47] to visit. And I mean that's the biggest
[64:49] challenge, you know, Palestinians. I
[64:51] mean, unless people encounter us and so
[64:53] on and figure that we're we're exactly
[64:56] similar to Jordanians, to French people,
[64:59] to Germans, to to Ukrainians, to
[65:02] Russians, to Americans, to the Chinese,
[65:05] all people. We're all the same. There's
[65:07] nobody who's more like that is like from
[65:10] a different planet or a different solar
[65:12] system. We're all we're all very
[65:15] identical. But I mean it is it sadly we
[65:18] have become in a way that it is not only
[65:20] that we have become dehumanized we've
[65:23] become a group of people that it we
[65:27] believe like we're caught up into this
[65:29] messy struggle because for the world
[65:32] believes that Israel has impunity is a
[65:34] special case you know it's a country a
[65:37] unique one of it one of its own that it
[65:40] is it that doesn't need to adhere to the
[65:42] different rules of the world that's a
[65:44] special circumstance es and we
[65:46] Palestinians we're a group of people
[65:48] that you know we're the worst of the
[65:50] worst you know we are um the most
[65:52] terrible people although what we're
[65:54] doing is exactly what every country does
[65:56] you know it's the same even even you
[65:58] know it is it's the people um in
[66:01] Palestine and so on who would be seen as
[66:04] people who are extremists or so on that
[66:06] they want to maintain their country to
[66:09] to um for their country to um to be a
[66:12] country I mean it is where the people um
[66:14] that the priority is given for the
[66:16] citizens. We want our refugees, the
[66:18] people, our family, extended family
[66:20] members to come and no longer live in
[66:23] refugee camps. All of this became very
[66:25] controversial and you know it is it's
[66:27] not only this to do this they had to to
[66:30] also I believe that the people in power
[66:34] not only to to to justify the injustice
[66:36] that is happening in Palestine
[66:39] um or for Palestinians they had to to
[66:43] genuinely attack the whole value system
[66:46] that we have created. I know you might
[66:48] not agree with this with international
[66:50] law and human rights or believe that
[66:53] many of these things are really um do
[66:56] not work or there's bad intentions from
[66:59] them. But this is a value system that we
[67:01] got countries um the best brilliant
[67:04] minds to sit together philosophers
[67:06] activists to come and say these are the
[67:08] values that we want to live in and you
[67:10] know it's we feel when it comes to
[67:12] Palestine this system is not working and
[67:15] it's actually it's not functioning
[67:17] definitely it is not and that's why it's
[67:20] causing the whole world to fall apart so
[67:22] we we're saying let's go back to live in
[67:25] the in the rules of the jungle where the
[67:27] survival is for the strongest beast. But
[67:30] you know, I tell you, it's not going to
[67:31] be like your average viewer. These are
[67:35] not going to be like nobody's going to
[67:36] benefit. It's not like, you know, it's
[67:37] big governments or the rich of or the
[67:40] richer people will come and split their
[67:42] fortunes with you if you're an American
[67:44] citizen or you're a European citizen.
[67:46] Most people need to understand that they
[67:48] are irrelevant that you know it is the
[67:50] world is much very much divided. there
[67:52] isn't proper equity in the world where
[67:55] very few people control the riches of
[67:57] most of the world and most of us are
[67:59] nobodyies. You know, we're idiots. They
[68:02] make fun of us because we're the ones
[68:04] who are willing to fight wars that are
[68:05] not our wars. And we're we're willing to
[68:08] let go of our rights and we're easily
[68:11] manipulated with a little bit of extra
[68:13] money on, you know, on Telegram or on
[68:16] Facebook or on Ma. You know, it is it's
[68:18] just a little bit of more podcast. you
[68:20] know, you brainwash people, you you
[68:22] encourage people to become part of the
[68:24] problem. You know, I think uh the way
[68:27] that I see it, I think we agree in the
[68:28] broad terms in that um for me there is
[68:32] an easy way. A lot of people like to be
[68:34] cynical about this and they just say,
[68:35] well, you know, wars happen and people
[68:37] lose and bad things happen and don't
[68:39] start wars and don't do bad things. And
[68:42] I agree, I don't support starting wars.
[68:44] I don't support any form of aggression.
[68:46] But I think the idea that uh you accept
[68:51] the violation of the property and the uh
[68:54] life of innocent people is not just
[68:57] something that you can chalk off to war.
[68:59] A war is something that happens between
[69:01] two militaries. But if you believe that
[69:03] it's okay to initiate aggression against
[69:05] civilians because of something that is
[69:07] done by other civilians or because of
[69:10] what God told you or because of
[69:12] something that some other government
[69:13] did, then you're violating the basic
[69:16] building block of human civilization.
[69:19] All of human civilization rests on the
[69:22] one fundamental basis of we respect each
[69:25] other's bodies and property. So I don't
[69:28] violate your property, you don't violate
[69:31] mine. And if we accept that, we're able
[69:34] to move out of the jungle and have a
[69:36] human society. If we accept that, we're
[69:38] able to live in a world in which people
[69:40] can cooperate and trade. And once we
[69:44] start cooperating and trading and find a
[69:46] way of coexisting without violating each
[69:48] other's property, that's what creates
[69:50] human society. If we don't move past the
[69:52] point of accepting property rights, and
[69:54] we continue to fight every day to prove
[69:57] who's stronger, so whoever is stronger
[69:59] gets to have the property, we will never
[70:02] evolve beyond what essentially monkeys
[70:05] are. We'll be flinging our feces at each
[70:07] other forever because every day is a
[70:10] chance for me to prove that I am the
[70:11] strong one. And every day, whoever
[70:14] doesn't have the property is going to
[70:15] fight the person who has it. So nobody
[70:17] can build anything, nobody can
[70:18] cooperate, nobody can trade, and we just
[70:21] no longer have any form of human society
[70:23] left. If we are able to accept property
[70:26] rights, if we are able to accept that
[70:28] people have the right to decide what to
[70:29] do with their body and with their
[70:30] property, then we can cooperate with
[70:33] each other and the benefits of
[70:34] cooperation will far exceed anything
[70:36] that we could gain from aggressing
[70:39] against others. So for me, the way that
[70:42] I see the conflict is that ultimately it
[70:45] goes down to the fact that this has been
[70:48] an international
[70:49] u attempt to strip people who live in
[70:53] this land of their property rights. If
[70:54] you're Palestinian, it's been a century
[70:56] now that Britain, more than a century,
[70:58] Britain and the US and all kinds of
[71:00] powers all over the world have just
[71:02] decided that the property rights of
[71:04] people in Palestine shouldn't count,
[71:05] shouldn't exist, people in Palestine
[71:06] shouldn't own anything. and they just
[71:10] need to deal with it and everybody just
[71:12] sort of assumes that this can go away
[71:14] that well, you know, they'll just deal
[71:17] with it. They'll accept it. But there's
[71:20] no there's no way for them to accept it
[71:23] when they can't have property rights.
[71:25] This is this is how I see it and and and
[71:28] I think it's it's similar to the way
[71:30] that you discuss it. But I wanted to uh
[71:34] focus now on uh Jerusalem. you've been
[71:36] discussing in your organization. You
[71:38] discuss what's been happening in
[71:39] Jerusalem in the Judaization of
[71:41] Jerusalem. Can you tell us more about
[71:43] that? I mean, it's not like I'm bringing
[71:47] like you know it is it's like uh it's
[71:49] not like part of Wikileaks you know. Um
[71:52] Israel has a municipality in Jerusalem
[71:54] which governs I mean it's by
[71:55] international law legally Jerusalem is
[71:57] two cities. It's a city that should be
[71:59] divided between two countries. The state
[72:02] of Palestine to come and the state of
[72:04] Israel. West Jerusalem would be the
[72:05] state of Israel and East Jerusalem would
[72:07] be the capital of uh of the Palestinian
[72:10] state. At least that's the I mean that's
[72:13] the I mean that's international law and
[72:16] that's the decision of the international
[72:19] community which is many people do
[72:21] respect and and so on. So Israel and and
[72:25] Jerusalem is like a very unique city. I
[72:27] mean it is it's a big city. So if you
[72:30] look at Jerusalem
[72:32] um if you look at Jerusalem compared to
[72:35] um I mean it is
[72:37] it's I mean it has a population of 1.5
[72:40] million people one and a half million
[72:42] people who live in it and they're
[72:44] divided into three different categories.
[72:46] One category is
[72:49] Palestinians, Muslims and Jews. Um half
[72:52] a million. I mean I'm using approximate
[72:55] numbers so but these numbers are easier
[72:57] to stick in somebody's memory.
[72:59] um and they primarily live in East
[73:02] Jerusalem or 99.9 they live in East
[73:05] Jerusalem. Then you have the 1 million
[73:08] um Israeli Jews and they're divided into
[73:10] two different completely different
[73:12] groups. One group is um the
[73:15] ultraorththodox Jews and ultraorththodox
[73:18] Jews I mean it is it's like many other
[73:20] ultraorththodox Jews in the comm in in
[73:23] communities around the world. they've
[73:24] they've you know they treasure living in
[73:27] Jerusalem and for them it is it's
[73:29] basically their life is only
[73:32] um studying religion. So um they don't
[73:36] get involved with um they don't do most
[73:40] of them are not engaged with work or
[73:42] building a career. Um their main respons
[73:45] are actually do not serve in the army.
[73:47] It's a big issue inside Israel. They
[73:49] refuse to serve with the Israeli army
[73:51] and I mean it is it's they do like
[73:54] either minimum minimal amounts of jobs
[73:56] or they don't work at all and they they
[73:59] they
[73:59] they rely very much on the social
[74:02] security system inside Israel which is a
[74:04] very developed uh system compared to
[74:07] many parts of the world much better than
[74:08] the US
[74:10] system. Then you have half a million of
[74:13] Israeli Jews and I mean it's a
[74:16] combination of Jews who live in West
[74:17] Jerusalem similar to any society in
[74:19] Europe and the world you know they they
[74:21] they they work the diff you know in
[74:23] different areas um in the society they
[74:26] do work businesses either work for major
[74:29] corporations or they have familyowned
[74:31] businesses and then you have I mean and
[74:34] this community some of them live in some
[74:36] of the settlements which are in East
[74:38] Jerusalem and when we talk about the
[74:39] settlements they're mainly the Jew
[74:40] Jewish only neighborhoods that live
[74:42] inside um that that are in East
[74:45] Jerusalem or surrounding East Jerusalem
[74:48] and many of these places are exempted
[74:49] from taxes and
[74:52] um and they have some benefits. So in
[74:56] general the municipality issues plans
[74:59] every now and then in 2020 in 2006 I
[75:03] think they had their first plan that it
[75:05] was also on online. You can Google it
[75:07] and you can find it out. was called the
[75:09] 2020 plan and it was how to make the
[75:12] number of to reduce Arabs who were 33%
[75:15] of the population of East Jerusalem to
[75:17] make them less than
[75:19] 20%. the population. So that's the
[75:22] municipality plan, you know. Um sounds
[75:25] very racist, um
[75:28] controversial, um unethical. I don't
[75:31] know what words you want to use about
[75:32] it, but it's a problem when a government
[75:34] comes and says I would like to have my
[75:36] population to look or to worship or to
[75:40] um to be of a specific group. And of
[75:44] course, I mean, this is not only it's a
[75:46] plan and to apply it, they use different
[75:48] tactics. One tactic, especially if
[75:50] you're coming into Jerusalem, the
[75:51] eternal capital as Israel claims of the
[75:53] Jewish people and the state of Israel.
[75:55] You go into the old city, for example,
[75:58] there's like 250 places of worship. Half
[76:01] of them are churches. I mean, there's
[76:03] like around 135 churches and the 250
[76:06] places of worship are churches. Then you
[76:08] have 80, I think around 80 mosques and
[76:10] then you have 70 and and then you have
[76:13] like 50 synagogues. It doesn't look like
[76:15] a Jewish city. I mean, especially
[76:17] definitely East Jerusalem and the old
[76:19] city, it looks like a an Arab city. It's
[76:22] churches, mosques, and so on. It's a
[76:24] very um
[76:27] um it's very clear. It's not 100%
[76:31] Jewish. So, they use different tactics,
[76:33] especially the the church after the um
[76:36] the Jewish National Fund and I mean it
[76:39] is the Israeli government ownership of
[76:40] land. Churches are the biggest the
[76:43] second biggest land owner um private
[76:45] land owner um in historical Palestine
[76:48] Palestine Israel the holy
[76:50] land and for um and Israel and many of
[76:54] these lands are actually in Jerusalem
[76:56] even the big
[76:58] ket where I mean the Israeli parliament
[77:01] and it's on a very big piece of land it
[77:03] is it's it's it belongs to the church um
[77:06] it's church property that has been I
[77:08] mean the church has been forced to um to
[77:11] lease it to the Israeli government. So,
[77:14] Israel uses different tactics. One
[77:15] tactic is actually by force just for or
[77:19] I mean it is by gunpoint they take
[77:20] pieces of land and they say this becomes
[77:22] the property of the state of Israel.
[77:24] Either they they they use a security
[77:27] justification or any justification to
[77:29] take over the land without paying the
[77:32] people, you know, compensating the
[77:33] people or buying the people or finding
[77:36] an alternative. And interestingly, this
[77:38] always happens only to the non-Jewish
[77:40] citizens of Jerusalem or the members.
[77:43] Doesn't happen to Israeli um Jewish
[77:45] members. Only happens to Palestinians.
[77:47] Another section, another area of
[77:49] problems is that they create they create
[77:52] unjust laws. So, it's almost impossible
[77:54] for a Palestinian to get the building
[77:56] permit. And you know, we Palestinians
[77:57] like to have kids. We we we like to live
[78:00] close to each other. We like to build
[78:01] homes. We we prefer to live in a in a
[78:04] house, not in an apartment. were living
[78:06] the American dream and then it it
[78:08] becomes you know it becomes almost
[78:10] impossible when Israel could create
[78:12] could provide less than a handful in
[78:14] some years it was less than a handful of
[78:16] building permits were granted for
[78:17] Palestinians. So Palestinians either
[78:19] they need to become um um to build
[78:23] illegally and then get their home
[78:24] demolished which makes sense you know um
[78:27] if you you cannot build a home illegally
[78:29] but if you don't create a building if
[78:31] you don't provide people with a building
[78:32] permit what options do you give people
[78:34] should they move to a different city
[78:35] where they will get the building permit
[78:37] so it's part of resisting the government
[78:39] that people build illegally and they end
[78:41] up getting their homes demolished I
[78:44] think there was into the new plan that
[78:45] Smatri has approved there's
[78:48] 95,000 homes that are under demolition
[78:51] threat or orders um in East Jerusalem
[78:54] and West Bank. You're talking about, you
[78:56] know, it is it's you're talking about
[78:58] 100 million American if it was if you
[79:00] compare the population. I don't know,
[79:02] correct me. I think there's 300 million
[79:04] Americans living in the US now. Yeah.
[79:07] Yeah. Around. So, we're talking about
[79:10] 100 million Americans would become um um
[79:13] around 180 80 to 100 million Americans
[79:16] will become homeless because their homes
[79:18] will be demolished by the government.
[79:19] No, no, wait. The we don't have 200,000
[79:22] homes in the West Bank. And no, it's
[79:24] it's the new 97 97 homes.
[79:28] 97,000. Yeah. But you're saying
[79:30] effectively half the homes if you're
[79:32] comparing to the US 100,000 100 million.
[79:36] It's going to be a lot less than that.
[79:37] The comparison with the US is off. It's
[79:40] off maybe. I don't know. But it's if you
[79:42] take about it, the average household is
[79:45] um is seven people in Palestine. So I
[79:49] don't know how much it is in the average
[79:50] in the US. So you're talking about
[79:53] 700,000. So you're talking about one/ird
[79:55] of the population in the West Bank will
[79:57] become homeless. Of course, we didn't
[79:59] say anything about Gaza where 90% of the
[80:01] people became homeless and their homes
[80:03] are demolished. So we're talking about
[80:04] Gaza. So it's I don't think I'm very off
[80:06] with Worth mentioning here, you know,
[80:08] before before the war in Gaza started,
[80:10] Israel had already demolished something
[80:12] like 140,000 Palestinian homes. 14 since
[80:17] 1948, I think, or 1967. Yep. Since 1948.
[80:20] Look up the Israeli Committee Against
[80:22] Housing Demolitions, their website, if
[80:24] anybody's interested, they've got a
[80:26] rundown of when and where these
[80:27] demolitions happen. So, yeah. I mean
[80:29] it's the thing is if you if you look
[80:32] from the outside you don't quite
[80:34] understand this uh terrorism that Israel
[80:38] inflicts on Palestinians and this theft
[80:40] and mass murder because it's couched in
[80:43] legal language. It seems as if it's just
[80:45] well they're demolishing people because
[80:47] they're building houses without permits.
[80:49] It seems like a reasonable thing. A lot
[80:51] of countries demolish homes that are
[80:53] built without permits except you've got
[80:55] a municipality that only hands permits
[80:57] to people from one religion and not to
[81:00] mention they do not allocate land for
[81:02] people to build. So we're saying that
[81:04] this is actually according to the
[81:05] injustice that on our own land. So we
[81:08] own this land and we're not able to get
[81:09] building permits the and every society
[81:12] needs to have land allocated for their
[81:14] community because you know especially
[81:16] when there's such a demographic growth
[81:18] you want to accommodate um the the
[81:20] growth and this gets completely ignored.
[81:22] I it's it's a huge I mean Jeff Halper
[81:25] who's the founder um or the co-founder
[81:27] of IAD Israeli
[81:29] committions he does like brilliant work.
[81:32] Um we worked with him in once you know
[81:34] they had this beautiful house
[81:36] um in
[81:39] in actually this house was demolished I
[81:41] think eight or nine times and we rebuilt
[81:44] it demolished and rebuilt nine times
[81:46] until actually the family sadly gave up
[81:48] and they said you know we're not able to
[81:50] rebuild it anymore even though that like
[81:52] we would organize like youth camps or
[81:55] work camps and people would rebuild it
[81:57] and you know it's it's you know it's
[81:58] it's not you know it's not only a
[82:00] property you know it's not only a house,
[82:02] you know, it is when when um when your
[82:04] house is demolished, it's more it's a
[82:06] home, it's a memories, it's the trauma
[82:08] that affects the kids. Um, say if you
[82:11] don't you don't have an a clue like when
[82:14] your kids know or your family knows that
[82:15] there's a family um it could take 10
[82:18] years for them to really implement a
[82:20] demolition order and you don't know if
[82:22] they're going to come up at night and
[82:23] usually they come in the middle of the
[82:25] night force you in few hours to um to
[82:28] take out your property, your your
[82:30] furniture, your clothes, your your
[82:33] photos, your albums, your you know your
[82:38] um your belongings and then they
[82:40] demolish the house in front of you. So
[82:42] many cases I've seen I've witnessed that
[82:43] the kids go to school and they leave the
[82:46] house and when they come back the house
[82:47] is demolished. They're in in such trauma
[82:50] and panic. It affects the psychology of
[82:52] the people your memories. I have a
[82:54] friend who I mean it is it's um he he's
[82:59] 65 years old now and it's he's he was
[83:02] all of his life he's been living in the
[83:04] home. He was born in the house um that
[83:07] was just recently demolished in Silwan
[83:09] over here and you know it is it's every
[83:11] corner had memories with his mother with
[83:13] his with his wife and with his kids you
[83:17] know it's even the plans that they
[83:19] everything got demolished you know it's
[83:20] very it's heartbreaking when your home
[83:22] is demolished it's not about something
[83:24] and it's very rarely for a Palestinian
[83:26] to sell a house it's it's such a um it
[83:29] takes a lot of uh you know it's not a
[83:32] property it's not a property it's more
[83:33] It's it's a place of memories. It's
[83:36] heartbreaking. It breaks societies. And
[83:38] now it's actually it's terrible. It's
[83:40] we're we're having a new phenomena here.
[83:42] I mean I thought I was here invited to
[83:44] speak on Palestinian Christians if you
[83:46] have tricked me.
[83:48] Um but anyways, but I mean it is it's
[83:51] usually the if the government comes and
[83:53] demolishes your house, um they send you
[83:56] a bill which could cost like maybe like
[83:59] a hundred or from 50 to $100,000 for the
[84:03] fees of your home being
[84:05] demolished. So many or they give you an
[84:07] alternative. They say it will cost you
[84:09] $100,000 for your house to get
[84:11] demolished or you demolish it yourself.
[84:14] And you know that you could do this job
[84:15] like like every government, you know,
[84:17] you could be more efficient than the
[84:19] government in in demolishing your own
[84:21] home and you could do it like for
[84:24] $10,000. And actually, it's very helpful
[84:26] because it no longer brings
[84:28] international attention or media
[84:30] attention because it's a Palestinian
[84:31] demolishing his own house. It doesn't
[84:33] really like bring that journalism like
[84:35] why are you doing it? I don't have a
[84:37] building permit. I was given an
[84:38] alternative. Either I destroy it or they
[84:40] will destroy it and pay a fee. And it's
[84:42] not like it's not a news item. Nobody's
[84:44] no like you're not going to find a news
[84:46] channel. Even the most boring bored uh
[84:50] news channel or you know to look for
[84:51] content on this topic. So it's it's
[84:54] actually it's a weekly um phenomena
[84:58] almost a daily um phenomena that houses
[85:00] are being destroyed in in in Jerusalem.
[85:03] Um most of the homes in Jerusalem um 50
[85:07] 50% of the homes in Jerusalem were only
[85:10] built after 1967 because of most of the
[85:12] people are building illegally and I mean
[85:15] all of these the majority the wide
[85:17] majority of these homes are under
[85:18] demolition threat um or have demolition
[85:21] orders. Now Smart Rich which is like the
[85:24] minister of finance issued a report of
[85:27] 97 homes that will be that needs to be
[85:29] demolished allocated budgets for them.
[85:31] You know, it's very interesting where
[85:33] Israel doesn't have budget to allocate
[85:35] for for helping, you know, single
[85:37] mothers or even to help um you know,
[85:40] Holocaust survivors, which are like very
[85:42] few um left because of old age and so
[85:45] on. But they they most of them are under
[85:47] the poverty line. There's no resources
[85:49] for them to be allocated, but there's
[85:51] enough resources allocated to demolish
[85:53] Palestinian homes um or pal or
[85:56] Palestinian, you know, or confiscating
[85:58] Palestinian land. always always
[86:01] resources for that. It's amazing and
[86:03] it's it's it's difficult to communicate
[86:04] this briefly to people because it's it's
[86:08] easier to portray the u the the
[86:10] fanaticism and the crime when it comes
[86:12] in the form of um you know fanatic from
[86:16] Hamas
[86:18] uh threatening death and so on. But what
[86:22] Israel has been doing for 70 80 years is
[86:25] far more destructive. But it is done
[86:28] through lawfare, through media savvy
[86:31] attempts at presenting it. But it's been
[86:34] the destruction of the homes of hundreds
[86:35] of thousands of people. It's the moment
[86:37] you dehumanize a group of people safe,
[86:40] then it's very easy to do whatever you
[86:41] want, you know. So it's regardless if a
[86:44] Palestinian um writes an article, if a
[86:46] Palestinian does a silent vigil, if a
[86:49] Palestinian does a song, if a
[86:51] Palestinian does um gives a lecture, if
[86:55] a Palestinian makes a podcast, if you
[86:57] are Hamas, if you are jihad, if you are
[86:59] whatever you are, Palestinians are
[87:01] always under attack for speaking up. You
[87:03] know, it's you don't have the right um
[87:06] to challenge the systems. And it's not
[87:08] only, you know, it's most people, most
[87:10] people around the world who who cherish
[87:12] or, you know, value the freedom of
[87:14] speech, the right to be able to critique
[87:17] government, who are always suspicious
[87:18] about the intentions of governments.
[87:20] Sadly, those people are always labeled
[87:22] as either fanatics, conspiracy theory,
[87:25] um people who are anarchists, people who
[87:27] are whatever, you know, even if you
[87:29] stand on the on the left or on the right
[87:32] of these positions or so on, as long as
[87:35] your your your narrative contradicts the
[87:37] narrative of the people in power or the
[87:39] government or so on, you become a
[87:41] problem. You become problematic.
[87:44] And you know it is regardless if you
[87:46] base your you know if you work hard to
[87:49] be to bring in the facts draw these
[87:51] beautiful graphs show them the pie
[87:53] charts show them the numbers show them
[87:55] the specific lows and so on. It's all
[87:58] about you know if it's you speak louder
[88:00] if you're a person in position people
[88:02] will trust you. It's very sad. Um most
[88:05] people are you know get into into they
[88:08] get involved in issues that's not really
[88:10] a priority for them sadly because
[88:13] they've been pushed through media
[88:15] through manipulation into taking these
[88:17] positions while what really matters for
[88:20] us is you know we live in this planet we
[88:22] need to take care of ourselves we need
[88:24] to take care of each other because if
[88:26] it's if there is you know it is it's in
[88:29] in South Africa Nelson Mandela was very
[88:31] clear about it he understood that
[88:34] liberation and right you cannot fight
[88:36] for the freedom of expression in the US
[88:38] only you know it's we have to do it on a
[88:41] global level and that's the system of
[88:42] international law and human rights that
[88:45] you know it's everybody should be able
[88:46] to say whatever they want regardless if
[88:48] Omar or safe or Netanyahu or uh Trump or
[88:53] Putin or whoever or Biden likes it or
[88:56] not we should be able to to argue and to
[88:59] debate and you know it is in in podcasts
[89:01] and articles people should come and
[89:03] everybody should present their ideas. If
[89:05] you think Bitcoin is an amazing um tool
[89:09] or uh currency, then it's you should
[89:11] have the right to advocate for it and to
[89:12] promote it. I wanted I wanted to u I
[89:15] wanted to ask you what are your thoughts
[89:17] on Christian Zionism.
[89:20] Yeah, Christian Zionism, you know, it is
[89:21] Christian Zionism is you know it is it's
[89:24] usually this is a very misunderstood
[89:26] concept. So in general, you know, most
[89:28] people they think, you know, it is it's
[89:30] I like Israel and I'm a Christian that
[89:32] makes me a Christian Zionist. No, it
[89:34] doesn't. You know, there's many friends
[89:35] of Palestine. There's many friends of
[89:37] Israel. There's many friends Christian
[89:39] friends who are of Palestine. There's
[89:41] many Christian friends who are of
[89:42] Israel. But when we use this term, it's
[89:45] a technical term. So basically, I mean,
[89:48] and you could be a Christian Zionist
[89:49] according to the different categories.
[89:51] Actually Belelffor was a Christian
[89:54] Zionist but he was also it's very clear
[89:56] and many people who have done the
[89:57] research would also label him or or
[90:00] identify him as also being anti-semitic.
[90:02] You know Bleur was against Jews getting
[90:04] into the UK from Russia and so on during
[90:08] um during the persecution. He didn't
[90:11] feel that Jews should be saved or um he
[90:14] did or um or whatever. Um so his concept
[90:18] was similar to many anti-semitic people.
[90:21] They said the best way to solve you know
[90:24] for us is we need to get rid of the Jews
[90:26] is to give them a country on their own.
[90:28] You know if somebody says like many
[90:29] people say oh let's get rid of the you
[90:31] know Muslims should have a country of
[90:33] their own in in Arabia for example.
[90:35] You'll find many Americans to cheer for
[90:37] it. Not because they think um American
[90:40] Muslims deserve a country but that's a
[90:42] good solution to get them out of the US.
[90:45] Sadly, it's it's part of it's getting
[90:48] Jews out of Europe was an idea like what
[90:51] Zionism was this tool or this vehicle to
[90:54] help it happen. Another group of people
[90:56] who are actually people who believe
[91:00] um you know who read the Bible in a
[91:02] simplistic view. They don't know much
[91:04] about the Bible. They haven't been to
[91:05] seminaries. They haven't done theology.
[91:08] um you know they just hear simple words
[91:11] or or or verses like the promised land
[91:15] um chosen people and so on and they say
[91:17] yes it makes sense Israel is you know
[91:19] and and they will legitimate um what
[91:22] Zionism is doing to our people um as
[91:25] something like prophecy and so on in a
[91:27] simplified version. Then you have
[91:29] another group of actually Christian
[91:31] Zionists or we would label them as
[91:33] Christian Zionists and these are the
[91:35] group of people who believe that there
[91:37] is prophecies are being fulfilled. I
[91:40] mean that's new to Christianity you know
[91:42] that's I I mean John Derby did this um
[91:46] in the 19th century. So it's a new
[91:48] ideology that somebody had a different
[91:50] reading of the Bible and so that there
[91:52] are prophecies that are being fulfilled.
[91:53] It gets many people excited. But sadly,
[91:56] this is not like something that it is
[91:58] it's academic or it is it's like a um a
[92:01] recognized dogma in the churches that
[92:04] you know for Jesus to come back, the
[92:05] Jews need to come back to um to the land
[92:08] and the the temple needs to be rebuilt.
[92:11] Then you have people who are like for
[92:13] you know it is the people who have
[92:14] Islamophobia, anti-Muslim sentiment.
[92:17] They they it's a simple understanding.
[92:19] They say the enemy of my enemy is my
[92:21] friend. And they see that the clash of
[92:22] civilizations, Islam is a big problem.
[92:25] We need to fight Islam. And and the
[92:28] enemy of Muslims is uh is Israel. And
[92:31] then it is Israel is my friend because
[92:33] it's because not because they like
[92:34] Israel. They don't care about Israel,
[92:36] but it's actually their love to um um
[92:40] their hatred to Islam. So these are like
[92:43] the different categories that I think
[92:44] that people would like not everybody who
[92:47] would be identifi not identify or we
[92:49] would label as a Christian Zionist is is
[92:52] a Christian Zionist for the same
[92:54] reasons. So it's different categories.
[92:56] So I think if you label yourself in one
[92:58] of like you find yourself that these are
[93:00] the I mean this is why you you identify
[93:02] with Israel, it's not because you think
[93:04] that Israeli culture is beautiful or
[93:06] that you think that um you like to have
[93:09] vacations in Israel. that doesn't make
[93:11] you a Christian Zionist or you're a
[93:12] Christian that you like as well. But if
[93:14] you mainly fall into these different
[93:16] categories um whether it is it's um
[93:20] there's also a fifth category it has
[93:22] really disappeared now but it was very
[93:24] strong in the um after World War II it's
[93:27] with the Holocaust guilt Christians who
[93:29] felt that you know Jews are not safe and
[93:31] we need to help them to get a country of
[93:33] their own and especially after what
[93:35] happened with the Holocaust that they
[93:36] need a country for their own. That's
[93:38] like five categories. Maybe there's more
[93:41] but because of time. So if you feel that
[93:43] it is it's you you support for any of
[93:46] these reasons um unconditionally the
[93:49] state of Israel then you are an anti um
[93:51] you are a Christian Zionist.
[93:55] That's that's a very simplified version.
[93:57] We can go through the history how much
[93:59] power it has in the US. Um I mean it is
[94:02] it's the growing Christian Zionism in in
[94:04] in China in Latin America in Africa. You
[94:07] have to make me a regular and you have
[94:09] to know more for free. You have to pay
[94:11] me in in bitcoins maybe. Yes, I think
[94:15] that's that would be a good idea. I'll
[94:16] give
[94:17] you a a bitcoin for knowledge deal.
[94:21] One more maybe. I don't know how much
[94:23] the bitcoins are. How much you value
[94:25] education? Um
[94:29] well education in bitcoin is a tough one
[94:32] because you know I sell I sell
[94:33] education. I don't sell bitcoin. So, uh,
[94:37] I need to speak up for
[94:40] education. Okay. Well, Omar, I want to
