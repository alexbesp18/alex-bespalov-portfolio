[00:05] Hello, welcome to the Bitcoin Standard
[00:07] podcast. Our guest today is Andrew
[00:08] Henderson, the founder of Nomad
[00:10] Capitalist, a company that helps
[00:12] entrepreneurs and investors reduce their
[00:14] taxes and live a more mobile lifestyle.
[00:18] I've been to Andrew's Nomad Capitalist
[00:21] Conference last year and I've found it a
[00:23] very fascinating experience. I met many
[00:26] of his very happy and satisfied clients
[00:29] and customers and I find his approach to
[00:32] uh business and life to be very um
[00:36] original and useful in this uh period
[00:40] and I think it's something that's very
[00:41] useful for Bitcoiners in particular. Um,
[00:44] so Andrew, you've been on the show
[00:46] before. We've discussed it, but for
[00:47] people uh checking in for the first
[00:49] time, can you tell us a little bit more
[00:50] about what it is that you guys do at
[00:53] Nomad Capitalist? Well, we're looking
[00:55] forward to having you back again at
[00:56] Nomad Capitalist Live in Qual. That's
[00:59] true. Yes. In September. Yeah. It's
[01:01] going to be fantastic. We've got the
[01:02] president of Mexico. We've got Steve
[01:04] Waznjak, co-founder of Apple. We got a
[01:05] whole list of people uh that play into
[01:07] the life philosophy I have, which is go
[01:09] where you're treated best. And I think
[01:12] right now a lot of people are looking
[01:13] financially, geopolitically, um, and for
[01:16] just personal freedom of moving
[01:17] somewhere that's more suitable for them.
[01:20] I think you want to look at go where
[01:21] you're treated best and diversifying uh,
[01:24] your life. And what I've always said is,
[01:27] you know, when my father started telling
[01:29] me growing up in the US when I was 12
[01:32] years old, he said, uh, this may not
[01:34] always be the place for you, especially
[01:36] if you want to be an entrepreneur. You
[01:37] should go where you're treated best.
[01:38] That's where the five magic words came
[01:39] from. But he would share you know
[01:42] stories about you know which countries
[01:44] were moving in the right direction and
[01:45] Singapore was doing this great and Chile
[01:47] is doing this very well and he would uh
[01:50] you know he said listen maybe we should
[01:52] move somewhere. We ultimately did not
[01:53] but back then the idea was you sell
[01:56] everything you close everything down and
[01:58] you move it all to Chile or you move it
[02:00] all to New Zealand or whatever the place
[02:02] was at the time. And I think that what
[02:04] people want to look at go where you're
[02:05] treated best. Uh I have an event in
[02:08] Koalaur. I spend part of my year in
[02:11] Quoalumpur. Uh I have a bank account in
[02:13] Qualum uh in Malaysia, but I don't have
[02:17] my company. I don't have the vast amount
[02:19] of my wealth. I don't work in that
[02:21] place. And so you want to distribute
[02:23] things where you're basically saying
[02:26] what is the best place for each thing
[02:27] that I do whether it's forming a
[02:30] company, owning my Bitcoin, living and
[02:32] paying tax, meeting the love of my life,
[02:35] whatever it may be. Uh, and I think what
[02:37] we do as a business is take a human
[02:39] approach towards helping people find
[02:41] that with a one-stop shop where it's not
[02:43] just Caribbean passports or it's not
[02:45] just move to Dubai. It's dozens of
[02:47] countries that we research and always
[02:49] working on new citizenships, always
[02:51] working on new tax programs that people
[02:53] aren't as familiar with. Um, and helping
[02:56] people do what's right for them. Because
[02:58] I think too many people, uh,
[03:00] particularly in in, you know, in let's
[03:02] say a Bitcoin space, uh, yeah, Dubai is
[03:05] the place to go. And there becomes a
[03:06] herd mentality. And I think that what I
[03:09] hope my business contribution is showing
[03:12] people options beyond the herd
[03:14] mentality.
[03:16] Yeah. And I think it's a it's a
[03:19] fascinating field because every day
[03:21] there are new options emerging and there
[03:22] are new things to explore. So based on
[03:26] your experience um recently, what are
[03:28] some of the most interesting trends that
[03:30] you find um in this uh field for people
[03:33] looking to get uh to go places where
[03:37] they're treated best? What do you uh
[03:40] recommend? Where are the places that
[03:42] treat people well these days? Well, you
[03:43] know, it's interesting because we have a
[03:45] whole flurry of people who are not happy
[03:46] with Donald Trump and some of them are
[03:48] libertarians and some of them are more
[03:50] left-leaning. And so they're saying,
[03:51] "Yeah, I mean, I want to move to
[03:53] Ireland. I want to move to Western
[03:54] Europe. Um, what people don't realize is
[03:57] that some Western European countries can
[03:59] be very tax friendly. And so, um,
[04:01] Ireland has a program for entrepreneurs.
[04:04] You can pay a very low amount of tax if
[04:05] you're a global entrepreneur and you
[04:07] move there. That's a pretty fast way to
[04:09] get citizenship, for example. So, if you
[04:10] live in Ireland for 5 years, you
[04:12] potentially pay a rather nominal amount
[04:13] of tax for those 5 years and get one of
[04:15] the best passports in the world. Um, you
[04:17] know, other people might like the
[04:19] lifestyle and the weather of a place
[04:21] like Malta, for example, where it's
[04:22] going to be harder to get citizenship.
[04:23] So, if you don't need a citizenship,
[04:24] Malta could be uh an option. Cyprus
[04:27] could be an option in the Mediterranean.
[04:29] Uh, both of those are going to have more
[04:31] Bitcoin favorable tax friendly programs.
[04:35] Um, for someone who's doing, you know,
[04:36] bigger numbers, Italy and Greece have
[04:38] lumpsum programs that can play in a
[04:40] certain way with with Bitcoin. Uh and so
[04:44] I mean we are seeing more folks who are
[04:46] looking to go uh to Europe including
[04:48] people who are into Bitcoin who maybe
[04:50] aren't you know staunchly right-wing or
[04:52] staunchly libertarian and they like the
[04:55] idea of getting that second passport. Um
[04:57] there's other folks who they say I want
[04:58] to be totally away from NATO. I want to
[05:00] be totally away from the west. I want to
[05:02] be totally away from all those kind of
[05:04] legacy brand countries and regions. I
[05:06] want to get, you know, the Caribbean
[05:08] passport and I want to move to a place
[05:12] that just has a very simple, you know,
[05:14] tax regime. Um, we still have people
[05:16] looking at going to Georgia. I think
[05:18] Georgia's kind of rebounded since last
[05:19] summer. Georgia is a little known tax
[05:22] friendly place. Um, you know, we have
[05:25] people who want to go live in a
[05:27] Caribbean island. We have people who
[05:28] want to go live in a sailboat. I mean,
[05:30] so it's a whole, you know, flurry of
[05:32] things. We also have people who somewhat
[05:35] like me uh they want to live a trifecta
[05:37] lifestyle and have homes around the
[05:39] world and they may not be tax resident
[05:42] anywhere and we just went through about
[05:43] you know 10 different countries uh you
[05:46] know Georgia being one where you don't
[05:48] have to really be there that long to be
[05:50] a tax resident and kind of have here's
[05:52] where I pay taxes which is something
[05:53] that you probably need a little bit less
[05:55] so in Bitcoin but it's something that
[05:56] you need to function the world but maybe
[05:59] I'm not going to be I'm not going to be
[06:00] falling into any other tax debt where I
[06:02] Because if it's 4 months, 4 months, 4
[06:04] months, and those countries are not
[06:05] European where they're eager to suck you
[06:07] in and it's just a mere days test, you
[06:10] know, if I live in Colombia 179 days, I
[06:12] don't pay tax. If I live there 183, I
[06:15] believe it is, uh, I do pay tax, you
[06:18] know, so if I can, you know, everyone's
[06:20] doing something different and it's a
[06:21] matter of, you know, for me, I like
[06:22] moving around a little bit. Uh, other
[06:24] people want to go to one place. Um, and
[06:27] that one place may even be where you pay
[06:29] tax. Uh but I I think we are kind of
[06:31] seeing a broader spectrum of people
[06:34] politically who want to leave including
[06:36] the Bitcoin space. I mean there's
[06:37] left-leaning Bitcoiners who they they
[06:39] like Western Europe for you know what
[06:41] they view as the personal freedom. Nomad
[06:43] Capitalist Live is happening on
[06:44] September 17th to the 20th in Koala
[06:46] Lumpur. This is the world's number one
[06:48] event for global citizens where top
[06:50] entrepreneurs, investors, and thought
[06:52] leaders share actionable strategies for
[06:54] protecting wealth, securing second
[06:55] citizenships, and navigating today's
[06:57] economic uncertainty. I'll be speaking
[06:59] at this year's event alongside Steve
[07:01] Waznjak, the co-founder of Apple, and
[07:03] others offering insights on how to stay
[07:05] ahead in a rapidly changing world. If
[07:08] you want to learn from real experts on
[07:09] how to legally reduce your taxes and
[07:10] obtain a plan B, this is where you need
[07:12] to be. Ticket sales launched today on
[07:15] April 15th, and you won't want to miss
[07:17] this. What What are your thoughts on um
[07:19] Western Europe as a as a destination?
[07:22] So, how do you think of it in terms of
[07:24] moving there and in terms of the
[07:26] passport? Do you think the passport is
[07:27] worth getting or is it way too much
[07:30] liabilities?
[07:31] One thing we're doing more of now is,
[07:34] you know, Malta, which is an an EU
[07:36] member state. So, they've there's two
[07:37] things you can do in Malta. You can move
[07:38] there. You can get tax friendliness. And
[07:40] we are doing actually a lot of that.
[07:41] Hey, I already have a passport. Maybe
[07:42] I'm already European or I don't care. I
[07:44] just want people to live in Europe. I
[07:46] don't really need the passport for
[07:47] travel. Um, I, you know, you can get the
[07:51] tax friendly program. You can pay a very
[07:52] small amount of tax living in Malta and
[07:54] you have that lifestyle. Um, if you
[07:57] wanted to naturalize by doing that, you
[07:58] could, but it it takes about 18 years.
[08:00] They say it takes five, but everybody we
[08:02] talk to in the ground says in pract, you
[08:04] know, for practical purposes, it's going
[08:05] to be 18 years for you to get that
[08:06] citizenship. Which is why I mentioned,
[08:08] let's say in Ireland, yeah, the
[08:09] weather's not as good, but like five
[08:11] years, they don't really mess around.
[08:13] You meet the criteria, you don't they
[08:15] don't really play the same kind of
[08:16] games, you know. So, is that important?
[08:19] What we're also seeing is more people
[08:20] saying, if I have the wealth, I'm going
[08:22] to pay about a million dollars and I'm
[08:23] going to get my whole family
[08:24] multipassports. not by living there for
[08:26] 18 years, but they have a a separate
[08:28] donation program where I never need to
[08:30] really even I I need to go there for a
[08:32] couple weeks. And so, I mean, if someone
[08:34] has $20 million and they are American or
[08:37] Canadian or Australian, I mean, yeah, I
[08:39] can see peeling off 5% of that net worth
[08:42] and saying, I'm going to get a European
[08:43] member passport, which means I can live
[08:46] in any of those countries for the rest
[08:47] of my life for personal freedom. I mean,
[08:49] yeah, we saw during co dramatically
[08:51] different perspectives in some of those
[08:53] EU member states. Some were pretty
[08:54] pretty heavy-handed and some were
[08:57] relatively light touch and so you'd have
[08:59] the ability to move between those, you
[09:00] know, generally speaking. Some of them
[09:02] have very good tax programs. So, you
[09:04] know, do I need the passport?
[09:07] Um, it's it I I think for a lot of folks
[09:10] a soft landing if you have a western
[09:11] passport, a soft landing of saying I'm
[09:13] going to either go and live somewhere
[09:15] some for some period of time. I'm gonna
[09:16] be lucky enough to get a passport
[09:18] through my ancestry or I'm going to make
[09:20] the million-dollar donation to get that
[09:22] uh with the fees to get that, you know,
[09:24] European TRA passport. I think that's a
[09:27] soft land that makes people feel
[09:28] comfortable. You and I talked at my
[09:30] event. I have no interest really in
[09:32] going back to the US. I don't need a TRA
[09:34] passport. I got invited to speak in
[09:36] Canada. Honestly, you you you really
[09:38] couldn't pay me enough to go to Canada.
[09:41] Um I have very little interest in going
[09:42] to Australia or New Zealand. So, if you
[09:45] remove those four countries, I mean, I
[09:46] we were talking I'd much rather go to
[09:48] Jordan, honestly, than any of those
[09:50] countries. I would have a I would
[09:51] genuinely have a better time in Jordan,
[09:53] uh, that I wouldn't any of those places.
[09:55] So, for me, um, you know, why would I
[09:57] donate a million dollars? Um, I have a a
[10:01] I have a slower track where I don't have
[10:03] to live in the the European country, but
[10:05] I can apply for citizenship probably in
[10:06] the next year, and I guess if I if they
[10:08] give it to me, I'll take it. Um, but I
[10:11] think that, you know,
[10:14] It's an interesting question, Stephanie,
[10:16] because I've had people who they
[10:17] renounce their US citizenship, they get
[10:19] the cheapest passport they can, then
[10:20] they apply for a US visa, they get
[10:22] rejected, let's say is a St. Kit
[10:24] citizen. Well, now they can't go to
[10:26] Malta because Malta requires you to not
[10:28] have been rejected for a visa for any
[10:30] other country that they have visa-free
[10:31] access to. Um, and so now they kind of
[10:34] like regret not and then their wealth
[10:36] goes up in Bitcoin and they regret not
[10:37] spending the million dollars. On the
[10:39] other hand, there's people that just
[10:40] want to spend the million dollars where
[10:41] it's like you don't need what it has to
[10:42] offer. And so I I struggle because
[10:46] there's so many different scenarios.
[10:49] Um I think having a TR passport is
[10:52] valuable. I think maybe the Portugal
[10:53] Golden Visa program has come a little
[10:54] bit back where they've, you know,
[10:56] they've they've resolved some of the
[10:57] issues of it being slow and they've made
[10:59] some concessions for the the fact that
[11:00] it was slow. I mean, that may be kind of
[11:02] the nice middle ground for someone who
[11:05] wants to protect it, wants to keep as
[11:06] much as they can in Bitcoin, make an
[11:08] investment, slowly work towards a second
[11:10] passport, which I think is looking
[11:12] halfway decent now that they're
[11:14] naturalizing people, um, is willing to
[11:16] make a little bit of an investment in
[11:17] learning a language or going to language
[11:18] classes. I mean, that could be a middle
[11:20] ground, but again, I mean, if you have
[11:22] 20 or $50 million, I might just say just
[11:24] just bite the bullet and get it now. So,
[11:26] that's kind of the spectrum.
[11:29] Yeah, I see. And do you see the um do
[11:34] you see do you see a huge advantage for
[11:36] getting one of these passports over
[11:37] getting one of these uh sort of less u
[11:40] less established brand countries um
[11:43] where it's easier to get it by small
[11:45] investment or something like that?
[11:48] I mean the benefit that I had is I I
[11:50] lived outside of the United so I knew I
[11:52] wanted to leave the United States when I
[11:53] was 13 and so I traveled extensively
[11:55] from a very young age and then I left
[11:57] the US for good and then I eventually
[11:59] renounced citizenship. So I had a good
[12:00] data point more so than some of the
[12:03] Bitcoiners who come to us where they're
[12:04] saying hey listen I'm an American and if
[12:06] I cross that $2 million mark I'm going
[12:08] to have some problems and I'm looking at
[12:10] getting a passport and renouncing sooner
[12:12] than later. I think it's harder for that
[12:14] person to predict what their need to
[12:16] return to the United States is. And by
[12:18] the way, I think you'll see other
[12:19] countries do some sort of de facto
[12:21] taxation. You're seeing the UK now, they
[12:24] won't make you give up your citizenship,
[12:25] but they want to impose an exit tax. Uh
[12:27] the Netherlands is is has been doing the
[12:30] same thing. But let's just talk about
[12:32] Americans. I don't know if someone from
[12:34] the Bitcoin people that I've heard from
[12:36] if they're going to have the data points
[12:38] at, you know, 35 years old to say, "Do I
[12:40] want to go back to the US for the next
[12:41] 60 years?" and what's the value of a
[12:43] million dollars to me take it under my
[12:45] my Bitcoin portfolio versus you know
[12:49] being a you know that certainty um
[12:51] certainly I think that somebody could
[12:53] renounce US citizenship with you know a
[12:56] TRB passport one of the Caribbean
[12:58] citizenship by investment programs for
[13:00] example where you have that access visa
[13:02] free access to Europe um you have
[13:04] visa-free access to a lot of places uh
[13:06] but you're not going to the US Australia
[13:09] Canada New Zealand that I mentioned and
[13:11] you need a visa is for a handful of
[13:12] other countries which are easy, Thailand
[13:14] for example. Um, you could do that. You
[13:18] could see how you feel about it, not try
[13:20] and go back to the US and eventually you
[13:22] could always move to Ireland or you
[13:24] could always, you know, I don't know
[13:25] that Malta's program was around forever.
[13:28] Um, I do think that that long-term
[13:30] Europe wants to get rid of those. Um,
[13:33] but, you know, there'll probably always
[13:35] be an opportunity to get European
[13:37] citizenship, but it might take more
[13:38] effort. And so I mean that's kind of the
[13:40] formula you have to run in your mind is
[13:42] if I get if I renounce US citizenship
[13:44] and I'm St. Lucian and I think there's a
[13:46] decent chance I could get rejected for a
[13:48] visa um because I just you know I'm not
[13:51] really established somewhere and I don't
[13:53] really have access to an embassy where
[13:55] you know they reject a lot of people at
[13:56] the embassy that I would go to. That
[13:57] kind of thing. You could try and live
[14:00] that life for 10 years and if you're
[14:02] just oh I really miss it. Well now
[14:04] you've got a 5 to 10 year plan to go and
[14:07] live somewhere. um where you get that
[14:09] access back. I mean, so that's the
[14:11] formula you've got to figure out. I
[14:12] mean, is it worth, you know, $200,000
[14:15] for the Caribbean or let's let's call it
[14:17] $ 250 with fees uh versus a million
[14:19] dollars with fees. Is that $750,000
[14:22] delta and whatever you think that that
[14:24] opportunity cost will turn into if
[14:25] Bitcoin doubles, that's $1.5 million. Is
[14:27] that worth being able to go to the US
[14:29] and Canada and Australia and New
[14:31] Zealand? I can't answer that for you.
[14:33] Um, and again I I I I you know I think
[14:35] that again if it's a tiny percentage of
[14:37] your net worth the answer is why not
[14:38] just protect yourself because my view is
[14:40] these passport programs will not be
[14:42] around forever. When I see an
[14:44] opportunity to get a passport that I
[14:45] want, I don't wait around because I know
[14:48] it could be gone as they often are. Uh
[14:50] that's the thing people need to ask
[14:52] themselves. Um for me the only thing I
[14:55] can say is if it's half your net worth
[14:57] just suck it up. If it's 1% of your net
[15:00] worth, you know, just just, you know,
[15:01] get over yourself.
[15:04] Yeah. I guess that Who knows? I mean,
[15:06] that's up to you. Yeah. You and you and
[15:09] I value the US as much as as everybody
[15:12] else.
[15:13] Yeah, I think that would be fair to say.
[15:16] Um, yeah, I just um honestly I think uh
[15:21] generally I just prefer being close to
[15:22] the Mediterranean. I think uh the human
[15:26] species thrives around the
[15:27] Mediterranean. It's the it's it's it's
[15:30] the perfect uh environment for humans.
[15:32] It's the right place, the right water,
[15:34] the right weather, the right everything.
[15:37] Those countries, a lot of tax friendly
[15:39] countries in like southern Europe for
[15:41] example. Um these are difficult
[15:43] countries to get citizenship in though.
[15:45] So like Greece has a golden visa
[15:46] program. It's one of the more affordable
[15:48] ones. They did raise some of the prices,
[15:49] but it was historically one of the more
[15:50] affordable ones in Europe. If you just
[15:51] want to live in Europe, right? Um, and
[15:55] so if it's like, hey, listen, I'm as you
[15:57] are, you know, if you're Jordanian and
[15:58] and you're happy to get a few visas to
[16:00] travel places, you don't need one to
[16:02] come here to Malaysia. Um, but if you're
[16:03] like, hey, I'll get the visas, but for
[16:05] Europe, I'd like a I'd like a golden
[16:06] visa. I want the cheapest one. Greece
[16:07] was the answer. But unlike Portugal
[16:10] where you don't really have to spend the
[16:12] time there to become naturalized, even
[16:13] in Greece, if you do spend the time
[16:15] there, they're kind of like, h, we like
[16:17] ethnic Greeks. I mean, Italy, it's
[16:19] slower to get citizenship. I mean,
[16:21] Croatia is kind of tougher. Montenegro
[16:23] is never going to give it to you in all,
[16:25] you know, likelihood. Spain makes it,
[16:27] you know, it's very bureaucratic. It
[16:29] takes over a decade. I mean, so there's
[16:32] a lot of tax friendly opportunities in
[16:34] many of those countries. I mean, Greece
[16:35] has a great tax incentive program,
[16:37] especially if you buy real estate. Um,
[16:39] you know, even Spain has some tax
[16:41] incentives, not as robust, but those
[16:43] countries are harder to get citizenship.
[16:45] So, it comes down to where am I a
[16:47] citizen and where do I want to live? I
[16:48] think what people should look at is
[16:50] number one, given the opportunity cost
[16:52] that people look at in Bitcoin, what's
[16:54] my family tree? And what you're seeing
[16:56] right now in Europe when they're saying,
[16:58] "Oh, people are getting European
[17:00] citizenship in record numbers." It's
[17:02] Americans who were always eligible for
[17:04] that European citizenship but didn't
[17:06] care. So, first things first, go through
[17:08] your family tree. Some countries it's
[17:10] only one generation or your parents this
[17:12] or that. If not, you're out. Um, you
[17:14] know, I have Norwegian ancestry. My
[17:16] parents are not Norwegian, so I don't I
[17:17] can't be Norwegian. But Lithuanian, you
[17:19] can go back three generations. I qualify
[17:22] for that, but they left two years too
[17:23] early, so I'm out. Um, but we've helped
[17:26] people, you know, you could be Hungarian
[17:28] or Polish or Irish, but then go and live
[17:31] in Greece and take advantage of the tax
[17:33] incentive. Um, so for folks who like
[17:35] that, I mean, a European passport is a
[17:37] sort of Swiss Army knife. Again, I'm not
[17:39] a huge fan of of living in the EU. Uh,
[17:43] but if you can get it for free, uh,
[17:46] certainly you can get a residence permit
[17:47] anywhere that you want. Uh, and you can
[17:50] go and live in those Mediterranean
[17:51] countries as well.
[17:53] Yeah. Now, of course, another
[17:55] alternative is maybe you don't need to
[17:57] move yourself and get another passport.
[18:01] You could maybe just move your Bitcoin.
[18:03] Um, is there a way to sort of legally
[18:06] reduce your Bitcoin tax liabilities to
[18:08] huddle in a way that's uh tax protected?
[18:12] Yeah, optimized, I should say.
[18:14] Obviously, nothing I'm I'm going to say
[18:16] here is is tax advice and and it's it's
[18:18] challenging because because there's 252
[18:21] sovereign countries and territories, but
[18:22] let me just kind of take kind of the
[18:24] western countries. I mean, generally
[18:26] speaking, what they figured out, and
[18:27] this applies to entrepreneurs, I think
[18:29] it would apply to Bitcoin generally, is,
[18:31] you know, from an asset protection
[18:33] standpoint, you can live in those
[18:34] countries and you can offshore assets.
[18:36] We've had people, they want to hire
[18:38] people overseas, they want to get an
[18:39] offshore trust, whatever. They know
[18:40] they're not saving on tax.
[18:43] Um, if you run a business, you know,
[18:46] people think, oh, I'm going to live in
[18:47] the US. I'm going to set up my business
[18:49] in the British Virgin Islands. I'm going
[18:51] to go there for board meetings once a
[18:53] year, and then the British Virgin
[18:54] Islands has zero tax, so I don't pay any
[18:56] tax. Well, you know, the Western
[18:57] countries have all figured out ways to
[18:59] to handle that. Um, now if you look at
[19:02] some of the tax regimes in Europe, um,
[19:05] number one, I mean, some of those are
[19:06] like lump sum where you just pay them a
[19:07] certain amount and you're done. Make all
[19:09] the money you want. So you don't really
[19:10] need to protect the Bitcoin there. But
[19:12] there may be some regimes where yeah,
[19:14] you put the Bitcoin in a company which
[19:16] may require to have some kind of actual
[19:18] account. You may I know that it's harder
[19:20] to document, you know, we've looked at
[19:22] doing this over the years like how do
[19:23] you document a ledger is owned by a
[19:25] company.
[19:27] Um but I think generally I mean just
[19:29] setting up whether you're in business or
[19:30] whether you're in Bitcoin, setting up a
[19:33] company and then going back to live in
[19:35] your high tax legacy brand country.
[19:37] They've they've put a lot of laws in
[19:39] place to prevent that. Are there
[19:41] countries that you know for let's say in
[19:43] business don't have CFC rules and so
[19:45] you're you know it's a controlled
[19:46] foreign corporation and you can go back
[19:48] and live somewhere and run the company
[19:49] overseas. Sure. But you know if we're
[19:51] talking the US, Canada, Australia, I
[19:54] mean really it's not just about moving
[19:55] your assets. It's about moving your you
[19:57] know your your kulo. Uh is I think the
[20:00] safest way to do it. Uh I'm not a big
[20:02] favor of, you know, these schemes and
[20:04] you hear about these schemes every once
[20:05] in a while for different things. There
[20:07] was the multi-pension plan for a while
[20:08] and then eventually the IRS or whatever
[20:11] else comes in and raids it. I like the
[20:13] simplest, cleanest way to do it. And I
[20:15] think if you're in the West, uh I'm not
[20:17] saying for every country, but if you're
[20:18] in these big western countries, I think
[20:20] they're looking for all the different
[20:21] ways to get it. And by the way, I mean,
[20:23] look at the new requirements uh in the
[20:25] US, like these BOI requirements. I guess
[20:27] they're not going to enforce them for
[20:29] citizens, but everyone's, you know, all
[20:31] these guys online. Oh, set up your
[20:33] business as a US
[20:34] LLC. Okay, you're going to have some of
[20:36] the highest burdens of, you know, you
[20:39] know, compliance uh for that LLC. Um,
[20:43] and they're trying to roll that out for
[20:44] Bitcoin. So I mean quite frankly I I
[20:47] think where you and I agree is go where
[20:50] you're treated best includes go where
[20:52] the politicians or go with the
[20:53] government or go where you know the laws
[20:55] align with what you believe in. Uh I you
[20:58] know I just don't think even if the US
[21:01] becomes more crypto friendly I I just I
[21:05] I I just I just think the long-term
[21:06] trajectories in the wrong direction and
[21:08] if the taxes say you got to pay I I
[21:10] don't really think a lot of these
[21:11] countries is a way around that. Believe
[21:13] me, I'd have a much more robust business
[21:15] if I could just go and sell people some
[21:17] kind of, you know, trust hold co
[21:18] structure and they could just stay right
[21:20] where they are. Um, but I just I don't
[21:23] think that's a good idea for many people
[21:25] knowing that we're talking to a broad
[21:26] audience who are in many places, but I
[21:28] think in the the big countries, I don't
[21:29] like it.
[21:31] I see. Yeah, that's interesting. I think
[21:34] you you're definitely on to something.
[21:35] So there's a there's a um you're right
[21:38] that maybe the environment is going to
[21:41] be more favorable to Bitcoin in the
[21:43] coming years with this new
[21:45] administration. But one thing that
[21:46] nobody's discussing so far as as far as
[21:49] I could tell, nobody has seriously
[21:50] discussed is removing capital gains
[21:53] taxes on Bitcoin. And I don't think that
[21:56] that is the sort of thing that this
[21:58] administration is likely going to be
[21:59] excited about. So they think of Bitcoin
[22:02] as a way for them to strengthen their
[22:04] balance sheet and a way for them to uh
[22:08] fix the fiscal and monetary problems in
[22:10] the US. So I don't think the uh that
[22:14] fits in well with an idea like removing
[22:17] capital gains taxes on Bitcoin. They're
[22:19] likely to keep that um in order to try
[22:22] and benefit from all of the Bitcoin
[22:24] hodlers that are in the US. I mean,
[22:26] you've got under two years left before,
[22:29] you know, historically Trump loses, you
[22:31] know, Congress. The margins in Congress
[22:33] are pretty thin as it is. Um, yeah, I
[22:37] don't I I mean, look at the first Trump
[22:39] tax reform. I mean, I'm all for lowering
[22:42] taxes for everybody, but I think there
[22:44] was a bit of um irrational exuberance
[22:47] from people who just run a small LLC or
[22:50] have a small portfolio. I don't know
[22:51] that their tax savings were as
[22:52] substantial as they felt it was. I mean,
[22:54] I think if you're a big corporation, and
[22:55] I'm not saying this is some
[22:56] left-leaning, you know, the big
[22:58] corporations, uh, but, you know, if
[23:00] you're a big corporation, your corporate
[23:01] tax rate went down. Uh, you were also
[23:04] forced, not offered, but forced to
[23:06] repatriate money that was held overseas.
[23:08] And by the way, it was written so badly
[23:10] to where everyday expats who lived
[23:12] overseas and had a business somewhere
[23:14] else were also forced to repatriate
[23:16] their money. So that just sits the wrong
[23:18] way with me that we're forcing pe, you
[23:20] know, companies to bring money back,
[23:21] including small entrepreneurs who choose
[23:23] not to leave in the country. Um, you
[23:26] know, I I just think there's a lot of
[23:28] things that rub me the wrong way about
[23:30] the tax policy. And yeah, I would agree.
[23:31] I mean, I do you get rid of capital
[23:33] gains? Um, I I think Trump makes a lot
[23:36] of promises. He said he would end uh,
[23:37] you know, global taxation for uh for
[23:39] expats. I haven't seen any movement on
[23:42] that. And I I kind of think that his
[23:45] understanding of it is is not my
[23:47] understanding of it, which is, you know,
[23:48] it'll be if you live in certain places
[23:50] or if you do certain things. Uh I mean,
[23:52] Trump's job is, you know, he wants to
[23:53] keep people in the US. And um yeah, I
[23:57] don't I don't see a zero capital gains
[23:58] tax environment there. I listen, we
[24:00] could be wrong. Um but I would at least
[24:02] want a plan of where I'm going to go.
[24:06] And yeah, I think by the way, I just I
[24:09] People have been asking me since since
[24:11] you and I met, oh, when Trump eliminates
[24:14] all taxes, you're going to want to move
[24:16] back. I I I No, I I I paid zero taxes
[24:20] legally and I gave up my citizenship.
[24:22] Maybe it's not all about taxes. Uh I I I
[24:25] just think there's a lot of people who
[24:27] if they saw the world and the places
[24:29] that you and I go, they'd say, "I have
[24:31] more personal freedom. I'm going to have
[24:32] a better social life, dating life." if
[24:34] you're single, all those things than
[24:37] living in the in the US. I think it's
[24:38] become a toxic culture. And I I
[24:40] understand you probably a lot of people
[24:42] who voted for Trump. I I'm not a Kla
[24:44] Harris fan. I beat up on Biden his
[24:46] entire four years on taxes and on and
[24:49] during COVID and all that stuff. I don't
[24:52] trust polit It's not what Bitcoin is
[24:53] about. I don't trust politicians. And I
[24:55] kind of wonder why people um Oh, Trump's
[24:59] going to solve it all. I I thought we
[25:00] didn't like I thought that's why we're
[25:01] in Bitcoin.
[25:04] Yeah. Do we change this because this one
[25:07] guy, he's the one guy? No. No. They're
[25:10] all bad and the whole system is rotten.
[25:13] Fine. Good. Fine. Closed in the
[25:15] Department of Education. Good for you.
[25:16] You save yourself some money. Does that
[25:18] fundamentally change the experience for
[25:20] you and I? No.
[25:22] No. I think uh it's important to keep in
[25:24] mind here. I mean, I I I'm very
[25:27] supportive of the rhetoric, the idea
[25:29] that you're going to slash government
[25:30] and do all of that. Um, and at some
[25:33] point at the beginning of the term, it
[25:34] seemed like they could actually be
[25:35] serious about it. But here we are. It's
[25:38] become clear that they've taken out
[25:41] USAD couple other departments. They've
[25:43] taken out a bunch of uh contractors and
[25:46] a bunch of contracts here and there, but
[25:49] this is really all cosmetic. This is
[25:51] rearranging the chair decks uh the the
[25:55] the chairs on the deck of the Titanic.
[25:58] It's ultimately 91% of the US
[26:01] government's expenditure goes to defense
[26:04] entitlements and servicing the debt.
[26:07] That's
[26:08] 91%. And Trump has basically made it
[26:11] clear that he's not going to touch any
[26:13] of those things. So, they're not going
[26:14] to reduce entitlements. They're not
[26:15] going to take people's social security
[26:17] and Medicare uh away for budget reasons.
[26:21] They're not going to reduce defense
[26:23] spending. All of this Doge stuff has not
[26:25] come anywhere near the Pentagon and the
[26:27] Department of Defense's massive black
[26:30] hole of a balance sheet that continues
[26:32] to uh eat up everything. And they're not
[26:37] going to well maybe they reduce the debt
[26:40] spending um by trying to bring interest
[26:43] rates down, but
[26:45] uh ultimately that they're not going to
[26:48] default on the debt. So there's still
[26:49] going to be interest servicing um to
[26:51] take care of. So there's an enormous
[26:53] amount of um spending 91% that is not
[26:58] going to be uh significantly altered and
[27:01] everything else is nice in a it's nice
[27:04] in a sort of owning the libs way which
[27:07] you know you can appreciate and it's
[27:09] it's nice to see the libs getting owned.
[27:12] Uh but uh it's also dangerous to think
[27:15] that this is really uh all that
[27:17] significant. You and I know I I mean and
[27:21] I worked I worked in I worked around the
[27:23] talk radio business for a number of
[27:24] years when I was in the I had a business
[27:25] in that space and I would go to the Bill
[27:27] O'Reilly events and the Laura Ingram
[27:29] events and I would say and I yeah
[27:30] there's a lot of this like let's own the
[27:32] libs. You know what's funny and it's
[27:34] Trump is supposed to be so different
[27:36] from this. I've seen going back to my
[27:38] childhood listening to talk radio almost
[27:41] kind of a victim culture. Oh, they're
[27:43] all out to get us. These government
[27:44] workers are all to get us. And I can buy
[27:46] into the premise of that. At a certain
[27:48] point, you meet some of these people
[27:49] that I met and it's like when do we just
[27:53] have a happy life? And you and I live
[27:55] away from this in places where we don't
[27:58] have to own the libs. And to a certain
[27:59] extent, you know, people like, why
[28:01] aren't you angry about what the liberals
[28:03] are doing? It's like because I just go
[28:04] out and talk to kind people every day. I
[28:06] float above the places where I live
[28:08] where I don't get too involved in their
[28:09] politics. Uh, you know, nobody's
[28:11] bothering me and I have a happy life.
[28:14] It's not my job to change the US. I'm
[28:16] not going to single-handedly change the
[28:18] US. You and I have bigger platforms than
[28:20] the average person does. We ain't
[28:21] changing the US. We ain't changing it. I
[28:24] mean, it's just not like we got to these
[28:26] people with their fantasy. We're going
[28:27] to fight till the death like we're going
[28:29] our guns. We're going to What are you
[28:31] going to do? Uh, I just think I mean
[28:34] people say, "Are aren't you upset what's
[28:35] happened to the US?" I'm not upset. I'm
[28:37] not not upset. It it is what it is.
[28:39] They've gotten themselves in a situation
[28:41] as Dr. Laura once said back in the day,
[28:43] some things can't be fixed. And to your
[28:46] point,
[28:48] 91%. How do you fix that? Uh, listen,
[28:51] fine. I mean, yes, clean up the clutter.
[28:53] Of course, there's there's there's abuse
[28:55] there. But to I think you made such a
[28:57] great point. How much of it is is we
[29:00] hate people who work for the government.
[29:01] You know what? Uh, yeah, I'm not a big
[29:04] fan of it either. I'm I'm more
[29:05] supportive of a park ranger than I am
[29:08] some, you know, education consultant in
[29:11] Washington. And there's more park
[29:12] rangers than people imagine. If you
[29:14] don't need them, fine. You don't need
[29:16] them. But, uh, I just I think that
[29:19] people, for all the talk about facts,
[29:21] don't care about your feelings, there's
[29:22] a lot of feelings going on. The bottom
[29:24] line is fundamentally my life, I have a
[29:26] 1% tax rate. I have a happier life than
[29:30] I ever did in the United States and I'm
[29:32] wealthier than I ever was when I lived
[29:33] in the United States. I earn well over
[29:35] 90% of my wealth outside of the United
[29:37] States. Those are
[29:39] facts. And I think if people took our
[29:41] advice, they could have those same facts
[29:44] for themselves rather than staying and
[29:46] trying to adjust the
[29:48] feelings of fighting for some cause.
[29:52] It's not all about taxes. Uh, but taxes
[29:56] are part of it and where the money goes
[29:57] is part of it. The Bitcoin Standard

[31:01] brought to you by the daylight computer.
[31:03] I love to work early in the morning and
[31:04] late at night or in the sun outdoors,
[31:07] but regular computer screens are
[31:08] terrible at these times and they strain
[31:10] your eyes. For years, I've wanted a
[31:12] paper-like electronic screen on a simple
[31:15] computer I could use to write. I tried
[31:17] several models, but none were very good.
[31:19] Now, finally, Daylight have delivered a
[31:23] fantastic full function tablet with a
[31:25] paper-like screen that's easy on your
[31:27] eyes and great for outdoor use. I've
[31:30] been using the Daylight computer to
[31:31] write my next book, and it is absolutely
[31:33] fantastic, and it has led me to invest
[31:36] in this company myself. Check out my
[31:38] interview with Anjan Kata in episode
[31:41] 249. There's a u you know people people
[31:44] have this image of Ronald Reagan as
[31:45] having been a staunch conservative who
[31:48] cut down on the growth of government and
[31:50] stopped uh no that's not true. Uh during
[31:53] the Reagan years government grew,
[31:54] government spending grew, the welfare
[31:56] state grew, the warfare state grew.
[31:58] Those two are the big ones. the welfare
[32:00] state and the warfare state they are and
[32:03] and then of course you know the you have
[32:04] the banking welfare state which is the
[32:06] public debt so these three are 91% and
[32:09] let's face it there's no serious attempt
[32:12] to tackle any of this and u I think also
[32:16] on top of that there is a u there's a
[32:19] dangerous mechanalist approach to
[32:22] economics in the Trump administration so
[32:24] it's difficult to make out exactly what
[32:26] he's trying to do with his trade policy
[32:28] because he's been um threatening tariffs
[32:30] and then removing them and then
[32:31] threatening them and then removing them.
[32:33] And so uh people are still confused
[32:35] whether he actually wants to have the
[32:37] tariffs or he's just using it as a
[32:38] negotiating ploy um to try and get some
[32:41] other things when it comes to say drug
[32:44] smuggling or whatever. But um ultimately
[32:49] I think there is a mercantalist
[32:52] mentality in in a sense of thinking of
[32:56] economics as being a zero- sum game and
[32:58] thinking of trade as being an
[33:00] adversarial game that the US needs to
[33:02] win at the expense of Mexico and Canada.
[33:04] The US needs to take on the Europeans,
[33:06] the US needs to take on the Chinese,
[33:08] that there is a trade war. This this
[33:11] mentality I think is pretty prevalent
[33:13] among the Trump administration. I think
[33:15] this is extremely dangerous. I think
[33:16] these tariffs would be massively
[33:19] counterproductive. They would be um
[33:22] completely completely um unjustified and
[33:26] they will not achieve the co the goals
[33:28] that are that they pretend to do.
[33:30] They're just going to be very harmful
[33:32] for people and I think if they go along
[33:34] with them, you know, if he if these
[33:36] threats become concrete, it's going to
[33:38] be devastating for people uh in Mexico
[33:41] and Canada, but also in the US. I mean,
[33:43] there's this notion that people in the
[33:45] US imagine themselves to be the world's
[33:47] largest economy and so they wouldn't be
[33:50] hurt. But the global capitalist system
[33:54] is so intertwined globally that it's a
[33:59] lot more complex than econ textbooks
[34:01] make it out to be. You can't just neatly
[34:03] put a tariff and then magically cause
[34:05] things to start becoming efficient to
[34:08] produce in your country. more likely
[34:10] what's going to happen when you impose a
[34:11] tariff is you're going to make goods
[34:13] expensive for people in your country.
[34:15] But I think the thing that people miss
[34:16] is also every the supply chains are so
[34:20] complex and so interrelated and making
[34:23] one thing in the US requires buying
[34:25] things from all over the world that when
[34:28] you place those tariffs you hate you you
[34:30] hurt the productivity of people in the
[34:33] US and you hurt their ability to produce
[34:36] more. So the best thing that you want to
[34:38] do is if you want to in help US
[34:40] productivity is to have free trade so
[34:42] that US producers can get their goods
[34:44] from abroad. I think this kind of
[34:46] mentality is lost on this
[34:49] administration. I think they think more
[34:50] in terms of u trade as being an
[34:53] adversary zero sum game. So we are going
[34:56] to try and get money out of the
[34:58] Canadians. We're going to we're going to
[34:59] make the Canadians and the Mexicans pay
[35:01] to sell to us. And then, you know, some
[35:04] people talk about how they're going to
[35:06] replace taxation with external revenue
[35:09] service as they said. So, we're just
[35:11] going to get the rest of the world to
[35:12] pay to sell us things and that's just
[35:14] not going to work. I mean, margins are
[35:16] very tight and there are other countries
[35:18] in the world. And here's Yeah. Yeah. No,
[35:21] right. There's there's other what we
[35:24] talk about, you know, at Nomad
[35:25] Capitalist and the event is all the
[35:27] other countries that are coming up that
[35:28] Americans don't really realize are
[35:30] coming up. I mean, I've showed this
[35:31] chart every year at the event of the
[35:34] economies like Spain is in the top 10
[35:36] economy. I think that's this is like the
[35:38] last gasp of Spain in the top 10 by
[35:40] default. I mean, Spain, they're working
[35:42] like 12 hours a week over there. Uh, and
[35:44] you're seeing the Indonesia and I mean,
[35:47] I was just in Indonesia. It's booming.
[35:49] The Nigeria, I mean, those are coming up
[35:51] into it. And that's why you're seeing
[35:53] bricks and all these other things, you
[35:54] know, where I I think having a US
[35:56] passport potentially in years to come
[35:59] could be quite toxic. And I'm glad I'm
[36:01] not an American at this point in terms
[36:03] of global business because I think
[36:04] there's going to be more people who
[36:05] don't want to do business with you. Not
[36:07] only just open your bank accounts or
[36:08] sell you their investments. Uh but
[36:10] they're not there's going to be more
[36:12] restrictions. You think these countries
[36:13] aren't going to fight back? I mean the
[36:14] US they're talking about a recession
[36:16] this year. My business we sell to people
[36:18] all over the world. Uh number one and
[36:20] two right now are the UK and Canada. I
[36:22] think the US is number three. We've got
[36:24] folks from all over the world. Why? I
[36:26] want a diversified business. I don't
[36:28] want Oh, there's a recession. we're
[36:29] screwed. I can sell everywhere. It's
[36:32] harder if you're an American. But I
[36:33] think where you and I align and I think
[36:36] the human side of this that people may
[36:39] not attribute to us or at least to me. I
[36:42] was 13 and we learned about manifest
[36:43] destiny at school about the same time
[36:46] that my father told me that the country,
[36:48] the US is heading in the wrong direction
[36:50] economically. And I remember he told me,
[36:52] I think I was, you know, 12 or 13, he's
[36:54] like, "Oh, it says here that, you know,
[36:55] Americans have to pay taxes worldwide
[36:57] and there's an exemption." And I said,
[36:58] "That's that's ridiculous. What do I
[37:00] do?" He says, "You can give up your
[37:01] citizenship." I said, "I might do that."
[37:02] At 13 years old, I predicted I might
[37:04] give up my
[37:05] citizenship. But I was also a little bit
[37:07] manifest destiny. And you know, they're
[37:10] bringing that back. I've never thought
[37:11] might makes right. And I think it's good
[37:16] that free trade has created
[37:18] opportunities for people in Indonesia or
[37:20] where I'm at in Malaysia or in other
[37:21] countries somewhere around the world.
[37:23] And I think there's something
[37:24] fundamentally wrong that, you know, with
[37:27] the idea that it should be easier for a
[37:29] guy who barely graduated high school,
[37:31] but by virtue of being in the United
[37:33] States, he's going to vote for someone
[37:34] to where he can make 63 grand, but now
[37:37] he wants to go back to making 67 grand.
[37:39] And in exchange, everybody in Mexico,
[37:41] Malaysia, and everything else needs to
[37:42] suffer. Uh, you know, there's something
[37:45] different about uh America first. The
[37:48] United States has already put has always
[37:49] put itself first in everything it's
[37:51] doing. uh maybe some of the policies
[37:54] have been bungled. Really, the the US
[37:56] hasn't been going around bullying and
[37:58] overthrowing regimes and doing
[37:59] everything else. There's a difference
[38:01] between, you know, Cambodia first and
[38:03] America first. Cambodia keeps to itself
[38:06] and they just trade and they want to
[38:08] grow their economy and they're doing a
[38:09] very good job at that. I think from a
[38:12] human side it's wrong to ring fence
[38:15] people that simply by the virtue of
[38:17] living in an economy that boasts people
[38:19] they get to make more money at the
[38:21] expense of everybody else and for all
[38:22] the people saying oh he's coming to
[38:23] Malaysia to take advantage of people no
[38:25] I want Malaysians to be more successful
[38:27] and if you're an American and you can't
[38:28] compete then you lose in my system the
[38:31] smartest the hardest working they win in
[38:34] my system and I think arbitrary barriers
[38:36] that prevent that from happening uh are
[38:39] wrong and I think geopolitical things to
[38:41] prevent that from happening are wrong.
[38:44] And quite frankly, that has a hell of a
[38:45] lot more to do with why I didn't want to
[38:48] carry a US passport than the fact that I
[38:50] paid zero tax every year when I filed my
[38:53] return.
[38:55] Yeah. And I think it's it's it's a very
[38:57] big misconception that people think that
[38:58] the government could just pass a law
[39:00] that imposes a tariff and then we're
[39:02] going to raise American wages. It just
[39:04] doesn't work that way. Um, if if this
[39:07] was the case, then the world's richest
[39:09] countries would be the countries that
[39:11] have the most protectionist trade
[39:12] policies. But it's the exact opposite.
[39:14] You know, the places that have actually
[39:16] prospered and grew quickly over the past
[39:19] few decades, they generally have a lot
[39:22] lower trade tariffs than the countries
[39:25] that have grown slowly or the countries
[39:28] that have shrunk. And it's just a very
[39:31] very u logical thing when you understand
[39:33] it in terms of economics. Tariffs are
[39:36] just taxes and there's no way that taxes
[39:38] are a net production to a net addition
[39:42] to to society's production. You're not
[39:43] legislating an increase in productivity.
[39:46] You're taxing people for working you or
[39:48] you're taxing people for trading and so
[39:50] you're making it less profitable for
[39:52] them and you're hurting their ability to
[39:55] produce. So this idea that we could
[39:57] just, you know, the Democrats because
[40:00] they were lazy and stupid, they let all
[40:03] of this u all of these foreign countries
[40:05] take advantage of us. But now we're just
[40:07] going to pass laws and now the Canadians
[40:09] and the Mexicans and the Chinese are
[40:10] going to pay us a lot more for the
[40:13] privilege of selling us their stuff and
[40:15] for the privilege of buying our stuff
[40:17] and then we're going to not need to pay
[40:19] taxes. It's economic fiction. You know
[40:21] the the US is just another um country in
[40:24] the world that buys stuff. Yes, it buys
[40:26] a lot of stuff but it's not the only
[40:28] country buying things that is that's the
[40:30] fundamental issue. That's you know
[40:32] that's the fundamental issue is that I
[40:33] mean I don't know what your comments
[40:35] are. You know I get shared some comments
[40:37] where it's like yeah good we don't need
[40:39] anybody else. I mean that's pretty
[40:41] myopic view that we we don't need we'll
[40:43] just make it all and we'll buy it all
[40:44] and we can just deal with it if the rest
[40:46] of the world that's always been the US
[40:48] view. That's why they're not in
[40:49] different organizations like the ICC.
[40:51] Ah, you know what? Like we're better
[40:52] than everybody else. We don't need them.
[40:54] And to some extent, there's truth to
[40:56] that. On this, there is not. Uh you can
[40:59] buy your own stuff.
[41:01] Yeah. So it doesn't matter. You know,
[41:03] the the biggest richest economy in the
[41:05] world, whether it's the US or China, if
[41:07] they would stop trading with the rest of
[41:09] the world, it would massively massively
[41:12] destroy their living standards. the most
[41:15] successful, the richest economies, the
[41:16] biggest, most productive economies. They
[41:18] reached that by being able to trade. I
[41:21] guess the way to think of it is this. If
[41:22] you want to produce the best cars, it's
[41:26] there's no alternative to being able to
[41:28] import all of the inputs from all over
[41:31] the world at a low cost. If you have to
[41:33] pay high import taxes for producing the
[41:38] for importing the raw materials that you
[41:39] need to make for your car, then you're
[41:41] not going to make the best cars. And if
[41:43] you try and restrict your inputs into
[41:45] the production of the car into buying
[41:46] stuff from one country, then you're just
[41:49] restricting the choices and inevitably
[41:52] raising the cost because you're giving
[41:53] up on all kinds of more efficient
[41:55] sources that are outside the country. So
[41:57] this notion that you could just make
[41:58] everything more efficiently in one small
[42:00] country at the expense of the world is
[42:02] ridiculous. It's ridiculous if the US
[42:04] was still in if we were still say 1990
[42:08] and the US was so much richer than the
[42:10] rest of the world as it was back then.
[42:12] But it's obviously even more ridiculous
[42:13] now when the US arguably isn't really
[42:15] the world's biggest economy. You could
[42:16] say China is the world's biggest
[42:18] economy. And I think more concretely in
[42:21] terms of industry and in terms of
[42:23] production, China is really out there
[42:26] producing most of the things that the
[42:28] world uses. China is the world's
[42:30] industrial superpower today. It produces
[42:32] more than 50% of the world's steel. So
[42:34] China on its own produces more steel
[42:36] than the rest of the planet combined.
[42:38] And with pretty much most advanced
[42:42] goods, electronics, cars, everything,
[42:46] China is now the leader in all of those
[42:47] things. And so the US is in no position
[42:51] whatsoever to try and think that we
[42:53] could make uh we could just become
[42:57] economically independent and cut off the
[42:59] Chinese. Um the the exports Chinese
[43:03] exports to the US are only about 2.7% of
[43:06] China's GDP. So even if the US stops
[43:08] buying anything from China, it's not
[43:11] going to be catastrophic for the Chinese
[43:14] to all of these products that the
[43:16] Americans buy, you discount them a bit
[43:18] and you'll still be able to sell them to
[43:20] the rest of the planet. There are a lot
[43:21] of Latin Americans and Asians and
[43:23] Africans that are would be buy those
[43:25] would be willing to buy those things at
[43:26] a lower price. So it wouldn't be
[43:28] devastating for China if the US were to
[43:30] cut it off entirely. The Chinese economy
[43:33] has just grown so much. There's so much
[43:35] internal demand and so much external
[43:36] demand that they don't need the US as
[43:40] much as the US needs them. If you wanted
[43:42] to rebuild and restart the US industry,
[43:46] you need China. If you want to make a
[43:48] car factory in the US, you want to have
[43:49] access to cheap steel, then you need
[43:52] almost certainly you're going to want to
[43:54] source some of your steel from China
[43:55] because they produce the majority of the
[43:57] world's steel. And the same is true for
[43:59] all of these other input goods and uh
[44:02] goods that you need for production. So
[44:05] it's it's a very dangerous mentality.
[44:07] And I think because Trump has his
[44:10] business experience, which gives people
[44:12] the impression that he's good with
[44:13] money, they assume that he must know
[44:15] what he's doing, that this is going to
[44:17] definitely work out. But I think it's
[44:20] dangerous. I think it could actually end
[44:22] up being massively destructive
[44:25] economically. people are going to call
[44:26] us communists because if you're talking
[44:29] to folks in the United States, I mean I
[44:31] think that I mean we work with some very
[44:33] educated, you know, successful people
[44:35] and you met you said you met some of
[44:36] them. Uh the average person that I hear
[44:38] from you're either in the left or you're
[44:40] in the right and so we talk about this.
[44:42] Oh, you must be you you must be for like
[44:45] men using the women's bathroom. It's
[44:47] like no no I didn't say that. Like
[44:50] there's nuance that comes from having a
[44:52] global perspective. Uh and and that's my
[44:55] biggest concern. Uh listen, I'm sure
[44:57] we're going to we're going to alienate
[44:59] some people here who are very much on
[45:01] the Trump train. And listen, I I I try
[45:04] not to follow all it, but the stuff that
[45:05] I follow on a global level, I I I agree
[45:08] with you. I think it has I think it's
[45:10] it's heading in the wrong direction in
[45:12] many ways or I think it'll be
[45:13] counterproductive.
[45:15] Yeah, it feels What are your thoughts?
[45:18] Yeah, that's the thing. Well, I mean, a
[45:20] lot a lot of people just get into this
[45:22] as a team thing and then you're just
[45:24] always with the team. Your tribal u
[45:27] belonging trumps all other um critical
[45:30] thinking. So, if you could if you're you
[45:33] know, for me, I'd like to be about 20
[45:35] other things before a nationality. And
[45:37] I've learned that. And I' every time I I
[45:39] try, oh, maybe I could be this, maybe I
[45:41] could feel at home here. I've realized
[45:43] for me all the other adjectives are so
[45:46] much more important than than what a
[45:48] nationality provide. And I think a lot
[45:50] of people look at it differently. Oh,
[45:51] I'm an American. That upset me that you
[45:53] said that. To me, when you have nothing
[45:55] else to to to cling to, that's when you
[45:59] that's okay, I'm American or I'm
[46:00] Canadian or I'm this or I'm that. If you
[46:02] like living there, great. But like I
[46:04] don't know why that's like like really
[46:05] you built a business, you hired, you did
[46:07] that should be what defines you.
[46:10] Yeah. Yeah, but I mean also if you have
[46:11] a family, you have kids, you want to
[46:13] give them a sense of belonging to a
[46:16] place that ties them together and to
[46:18] their wider family and so on. I'm not I
[46:20] don't know if you have a family
[46:23] more we may agree that in some ways and
[46:25] I and I like that and you know what
[46:27] there's there's
[46:29] are there places that I live and there's
[46:31] there citizenships that I have that I
[46:32] feel a certain emotional connection to.
[46:34] Yes. I don't think it's as high as as
[46:36] other people and I don't hold those
[46:38] places to where they're above repute. Uh
[46:40] I I call them as I see them uh with
[46:43] everything.
[46:45] Um I to me having an identity of yeah
[46:49] here's where we live and here's what we
[46:50] do and here's how we act and you know
[46:52] for me uh you know here's how you
[46:54] contribute to other people who don't who
[46:56] don't have it as well. Uh I mean those
[46:58] are a lot more important. Um, I can see
[47:01] the benefit of like getting an ancestry
[47:03] citizenship. And in my case, sure, if I
[47:06] would have been given Lithuanian, that
[47:07] would have felt that would have felt
[47:09] nice had I been able to do that. Okay,
[47:11] I'm going back and I've I've traced the
[47:13] family tree steps from part of my family
[47:15] and now I'm I'm one with them again. I
[47:18] don't know that I would ever be at a
[47:19] situation where I'd say, "Oh, yeah, I'm
[47:21] I'm proud to be lethal. They're the
[47:22] best." I'd feel good about it, but I
[47:24] would realize it's a feeling. And I I
[47:27] think that you know the world is um you
[47:31] know the the US is becoming a less and
[47:33] less significant player that doesn't
[47:35] realize it's becoming a less and less
[47:36] significant player. Uh I don't have an
[47:39] opinion on that one way or the other. It
[47:40] is whether I like it or not. It's
[47:43] happening and
[47:45] um I yeah I think people need to be
[47:48] flexible.
[47:50] Yeah. Listen, here's where we came from.
[47:52] Let's have some of those values. There's
[47:54] listen, there's still American values
[47:55] that I have. There's also American
[47:57] values that I had that I realized, you
[47:59] know what, now that I've seen how they
[48:01] do it over here, I like that better. I I
[48:03] I think that, you know, to me, the most
[48:05] American value is is taking things from
[48:07] different places. Um I I I think who you
[48:11] are is more important than where you're
[48:12] from.
[48:14] Yeah. What are your thoughts on uh
[48:17] China? Do you do business there? Do you
[48:19] recommend people go there? What are your
[48:21] uh general impressions? You know, I went
[48:24] to China many many years ago and I
[48:26] really enjoyed it and I saw a lot of
[48:27] positivity. What's interesting about
[48:28] China is I mean I think people there are
[48:30] becoming more nationalistic also.
[48:31] They're more proud to be Chinese. I mean
[48:32] the Chinese passports becoming uh better
[48:35] certainly the global south. Um I think
[48:37] that a lot of the global south is
[48:38] looking and saying okay you know I'd
[48:40] like to go to Europe once in a while. I
[48:41] can get a tourist visa. Um but I think
[48:43] more Chinese are looking inward as well.
[48:46] And I wonder to what extent it ever
[48:47] becomes something like where the United
[48:49] States is. I think more and people in
[48:51] China like having a plan B and so are we
[48:54] doing business there. Uh it's not an
[48:56] area I ever went to because I felt like
[48:57] there's I mean because they're such big
[48:59] believers in plan B historically. I
[49:02] figured let everybody else have that and
[49:03] I'll go somewhere else. We we do now
[49:05] have a few people in China and we are
[49:07] looking at it and I'll and I'll leave it
[49:08] at that. But
[49:11] um you know it's interesting to kind of
[49:13] see like they're kind of becoming a bit
[49:16] more of an American mentality about
[49:18] their own country while also realizing
[49:20] hey my approach of it's not beyond
[49:23] repute. We better have a plan to go
[49:24] somewhere else. You know the gold bars
[49:26] and the p the second set of papers in
[49:28] the in the in the fast boat down at the
[49:30] harbor. Um, so it'll be interesting to
[49:33] see what happens in the coming years to,
[49:36] you know, kind of Chinese nationalism
[49:37] and and and and what that, you know,
[49:39] creates. But, you know, one of the guys
[49:41] speaking at the event is Cyrus Jansen.
[49:43] Uh, you know, I people will say, oh, you
[49:47] know, Cyrus is always so pro-China. You
[49:50] know, in the same way people will say
[49:51] about me, he's so anti- US. I mean, when
[49:53] you've when all you ever heard is
[49:56] propaganda, you know, honesty sounds,
[49:58] you know, it's pretty offensive. And uh,
[50:02] yeah, to your point, China's doing a lot
[50:04] of good things. I mean, if they produce
[50:05] the most steel, I mean, they're most
[50:06] innovative in some areas. I mean,
[50:08] they're following a playbook, I guess,
[50:10] perhaps akin to like the Koreans, you
[50:12] know, making cars. Remember back when we
[50:13] were kids? I mean, I grew up in the US.
[50:15] It's like, oh, Kia, you know, you double
[50:16] its value by filling it up with gas. Um,
[50:20] I mean those Korean cars have become
[50:21] have have become incredible and I think
[50:24] China's in some simplified way kind of
[50:26] followed the same trajectory from making
[50:28] cheap goods to being a leader in a lot
[50:30] of areas including tech and um I my my
[50:34] simple concern from my the world that I
[50:37] live in which is you know global
[50:39] citizenship is yeah I wouldn't want to
[50:42] be a Chinese citizen and all that comes
[50:44] with that but I'd like to be able to do
[50:46] business with China and I think there'll
[50:48] be more restrictions if you're American
[50:49] or British, whatever else. So, I'm happy
[50:51] to be where I'm at and being neutral and
[50:55] um yeah, I respect their country works
[50:57] differently from the US and and you
[50:59] know, I probably don't agree with a lot
[51:01] of stuff. I wouldn't live there. Um but
[51:04] I mean, you know, we still have stuff in
[51:05] Hong Kong and I um I think quite frankly
[51:09] it's a good hedge if you think that the
[51:11] Western world's going in the wrong
[51:12] direction. The Bitcoin Standard podcast

[52:45] really change a lot about my thinking on
[52:47] China. As you said, I think we've u
[52:50] we're once you wake up to it, you
[52:52] realize just how ridiculously negative
[52:56] the western coverage and discussion of
[52:58] China is. That uh you start seeing it
[53:02] everywhere. I mean, there was an article
[53:03] in the Financial Times talking about the
[53:06] crisis of crime stabbings in Beijing and
[53:10] they cited two stabbings over a period
[53:13] of a few weeks or something like that.
[53:14] There were two stabbings in a city the
[53:16] size of Beijing which you know is uh a
[53:19] slow morning in
[53:21] London by Right. Yeah. I I mean and
[53:25] you're seeing I mean okay like the
[53:26] luxury brands are down uh largely on on
[53:29] softer demand from China and now they're
[53:31] down based on on tariffs because a lot
[53:32] of them are are in Europe. But I mean I
[53:34] think you've got an incredibly resilient
[53:36] consumer economy. Yeah, you're right. I
[53:38] mean I was reading something about oh
[53:40] all these Chinese firms are having
[53:41] trouble staying afloat. Uh, I'll tell
[53:43] you what. I mean, look at my stock
[53:44] portfolio this year. I mean, uh, China
[53:46] and everything, China is doing pretty
[53:48] well, quite frankly. And if you look at
[53:49] the last year, it's doing pretty well.
[53:51] Uh, the US is not doing as well this
[53:53] year. I mean, the US has been getting
[53:55] beaten up.
[53:56] Um, I I I you know, listen, I I don't
[54:01] think someone has to pick a side. Uh,
[54:04] you know, for me, one of the big lessons
[54:06] is a certain neutrality. I remember the
[54:08] first time I came to Malaysia and I
[54:10] started seeing all the Palestine, you
[54:11] know, stickers because it's, you know,
[54:13] the majority Muslim population is very
[54:15] much in favor of Palestine and I'd never
[54:17] really thought about it because you grew
[54:18] up in the US and and at least back then
[54:21] it was Israel Israel Israel. Uh listen,
[54:24] I have I have, you know, friends from
[54:26] Israel. Um but, you know, it's like you
[54:28] really have to me you have to see the
[54:30] world to change your perspective. And I
[54:32] think that again there's probably some
[54:33] people in the audience that are like,
[54:35] "Oh, it's the CCP. it's China, you can't
[54:38] trust them. I never said live there. Um,
[54:41] but I think even the social credit score
[54:42] stuff is a little bit overblown, quite
[54:44] frankly. And I think the West does some
[54:46] of that. And by the way, we saw that
[54:47] last summer in Georgia. They're passing
[54:49] this foreign agent registration law and
[54:51] the stocks all went down. Well, now the
[54:53] stocks are back up at near record highs.
[54:55] And um, you realize, yeah, like US Aid,
[54:59] which you mentioned earlier. Yeah, they
[55:01] were in Georgia. I think I passed by
[55:03] their office a couple of times in some
[55:04] building that I was in. And you know
[55:06] what? Yeah. Turns out that in George and
[55:08] other countries, they were there
[55:09] interfering in the politics. And you
[55:12] know, uh I I have to say I kind of
[55:14] respect the Chinese view of doing it
[55:16] more. By the way, now they're taking
[55:17] over the Caribbean. I just read. Um and
[55:20] they're doing deals in I think uh you
[55:23] know, Barbados and elsewhere.
[55:26] Um and you know, I think their approach
[55:29] is like in Africa, we want to actually,
[55:31] you know, do business. It's not just you
[55:33] know, empty gestures. So listen,
[55:36] everyone gets to decide what's best for
[55:37] their country and a lot of countries are
[55:39] choosing what they're saying that what
[55:40] China offers them is better than what
[55:42] the US and the west offers them. We had
[55:44] Nigel Farage at at our event last year
[55:46] and three years ago. And I said, why
[55:49] should people, you know, not want to
[55:50] work with China? He said, well, they
[55:51] should look at our shared values in the
[55:53] West. And and Nigel's always been very
[55:56] nice to me, but I I kind of wonder what
[55:58] are these shared values? I think there's
[56:00] a lot of feeling about these great
[56:02] values that in practice aren't such
[56:04] great values and China's filling that
[56:08] void. Yeah. I think the you know the
[56:10] examples of the uh negative coverage is
[56:13] all of this China's taking over Africa.
[56:16] China is um expanding its influence and
[56:19] when you hear it from American and
[56:21] Western media it's presented as if it's
[56:22] this incredibly evil plan to take over
[56:26] the world and they lost too much. Yeah.
[56:29] But really, what is it China doing? I
[56:30] mean, China hasn't fired a bullet in 40
[56:34] years. China has not been involved in a
[56:36] in a war in 40 years. And all of its
[56:39] business activities in Africa and in the
[56:42] Caribbean and Latin America, all of
[56:45] that. And in Asia, all of that is
[56:47] business. Um, and and it's we've not
[56:50] seen a single example of China sending
[56:52] in a military to collect payment when
[56:55] somebody defaulted. We've not seen uh we
[56:58] we've not seen the uh IMF money printer
[57:01] uh go and just create fake money and in
[57:04] debt countries. They don't have a money
[57:06] printer like the US. They don't have the
[57:08] ability to make money out of thin air to
[57:11] entrap countries into debt. So they have
[57:13] to be responsible with the money that
[57:14] they lend. And so you know they go to a
[57:18] country that doesn't have advanced
[57:20] seapport. they invest in it and it's an
[57:23] investment and it should work out and if
[57:26] it doesn't work out you know there are
[57:29] there are bankruptcy proceedings that
[57:31] take place but to dis to to discuss it
[57:35] as if it is some kind of takeover as if
[57:36] it's some kind of imperialist uh
[57:39] conquering of the world is ridiculous.
[57:41] It's just they're doing business and
[57:43] they're doing business because they have
[57:44] very high productivity because they have
[57:46] enormous economic growth. They have the
[57:48] world's most advanced industries. is
[57:49] they have the world's most advanced
[57:51] machinery and everything. You know, the
[57:52] biggest ships, the biggest seap ports,
[57:54] the biggest most advanced, highest
[57:56] productivity, capital, infrastructure
[57:58] everywhere is now basically being made
[58:00] in China and it's being exported to the
[58:03] world. So, the world gets it for the
[58:04] same reason that it got cars from Europe
[58:07] 100 years ago. It was the best
[58:10] technology that you could get. And so,
[58:12] it's spreading all over the world. And
[58:14] yeah, we keep hearing this negative uh
[58:16] propaganda about it. But then there's
[58:18] the other one, my favorite, which was
[58:21] really just an incredible uh discovery.
[58:25] All of these stories about ghost cities
[58:27] in China. I'm sure you've seen these.
[58:29] They post this Twitter thread. China's
[58:31] building all these cities and there's no
[58:33] demand for them. And now there's all of
[58:35] these cities that were made for millions
[58:37] of people, but now nobody lives there.
[58:39] And it's I' I've been seeing these for
[58:41] 15, 20 years. And everybody keeps
[58:42] saying, you know, when China's on the
[58:45] verge of economic collapse because now
[58:47] the real estate bubble is going to burst
[58:49] and then everything's going to come
[58:50] crashing down and the banking system is
[58:52] going to crashing down and the whole
[58:53] China bubble is going to collapse. And
[58:56] we've been hearing this stuff for 25
[58:57] years easily. I mean, somebody showed me
[58:59] a book that was I think a 25-year-old
[59:01] book um saying something like this. And
[59:04] yet turns out these ghost cities are
[59:07] just being constructed. They're
[59:09] construction sites. Nobody lives there
[59:10] because they're not done yet. And then
[59:12] in a couple of years they'll be done and
[59:13] then people will start moving in and
[59:15] then a couple of years later you'll see
[59:16] there are hundreds of thousands of
[59:17] people living there and it's a thriving
[59:20] clean amazing metropolis. Um but people
[59:24] move on to the next construction
[59:26] project. Let's do this thing. And by the
[59:27] way part of why we're doing you know
[59:30] pushing to really expand business in the
[59:31] global south is you know I I know how I
[59:34] live. I know what I've accomplished. I
[59:36] know how I feel. And it's like I'm kind
[59:38] of try I'm kind of tired of of
[59:40] convincing myself. I mean, one of the
[59:42] reasons we have the event in Qualur is
[59:44] if you're coming from the US or Canada,
[59:46] I want you to be bought into my mission.
[59:48] I don't want to host it in Cancun where
[59:49] it's just an easy flight and I'm getting
[59:51] people who aren't committed. Um because
[59:53] listen, there's plenty of really smart
[59:55] Americans and North Americans who I
[59:57] would love and I love doing business
[59:58] with, love meeting them. I listen, I'm
[60:00] from the United States. When when we
[60:01] align ideologically, that's a great
[60:04] conversation. And yet I don't want just
[60:06] random people coming because I think
[60:08] that you know I don't know how much I'm
[60:10] going to convince people of this. But
[60:13] what you what you said spoke to me the
[60:15] sense of this is competition. That's
[60:17] supposed to be one of the the hallmarks
[60:18] of of the American machine is
[60:22] competition and come here and work hard
[60:25] and and the the best, you know, man or
[60:27] woman will win. Well, yeah. I mean in a
[60:30] lot of places around the world uh the
[60:33] United States is losing uh in entire
[60:35] regions they're losing. Why? Because
[60:37] there's the competitive process and they
[60:39] lost. They didn't provide the best
[60:41] service. They didn't provide the best
[60:42] product. Um and you know I think the
[60:46] narrative has shifted and I've talked
[60:47] about this. I mean it's in the culture
[60:50] and now you see Trump as kind of
[60:51] representation of people are upset.
[60:52] They're not entirely sure why because
[60:54] they've never heard of Indonesia as a
[60:55] growing economy and the fourth largest
[60:57] population in the world. uh you know
[60:59] when they say where are you gonna move
[61:00] they think good luck in the UK yeah
[61:03] there's places besides the UK um and
[61:06] it's just I I I you know I I just think
[61:10] like now it's become this case of sour
[61:12] grapes where somehow it's not about
[61:13] competition anymore now we need to make
[61:15] it uncompetitive even that was our
[61:16] reason but back when we thought we were
[61:18] winning it should be competitive and
[61:19] then when someone else was winning I
[61:22] I you know the world will go on without
[61:26] these high tax legacy brand countries
[61:28] I'm not saying they're of zero
[61:29] relevance, but they're of decreasing
[61:31] relevance every day. And at a certain
[61:33] point, you and I just need to enjoy our
[61:35] lives. And uh those who want to come and
[61:38] pay zero tax on their crypto can come.
[61:40] And those who uh want to stay at home
[61:42] and and pound their chests uh can do
[61:45] that. And I'll wish them well.
[61:47] And God bless you.
[61:50] Yeah. Well, you know, it's interesting.
[61:52] over the last 20 25 years. There was a
[61:54] map that I saw the other day that showed
[61:56] who was the world's biggest u every
[61:59] country's uh biggest trade partner and
[62:01] 20 25 years ago the US was the number
[62:04] one trade partner for most countries in
[62:07] the world. Most countries trade with the
[62:08] US and now it's almost all China.
[62:13] Everybody's biggest trade partner now is
[62:15] China. So South America. China. Yeah,
[62:18] exactly. Even in South America, they get
[62:21] so much from China and
[62:23] particularly capital goods and heavy
[62:26] infrastructure. So, it's really becoming
[62:28] a a very different world. And I think
[62:31] it's sad to see this kind of reaction. I
[62:33] mean, this is on on a personal level.
[62:35] When you see somebody face adversity and
[62:37] lash out at others rather than
[62:39] introspect and trying to find the
[62:41] problems within their own actions, then
[62:43] you see that that person is likely going
[62:45] to exacerbate things and going to make
[62:47] things worse. Even if others may have
[62:49] done bad things to you, you know, the
[62:52] productive path forward is for you to
[62:54] look inwards and figure out how you got
[62:56] yourself into the position where they're
[62:57] able to do that for you. But in this
[62:59] case, it is an entirely self-inflicted
[63:02] wound. The the Chinese government is not
[63:05] responsible for the collapse of
[63:07] industrialization in the US. It's not
[63:09] China's fault. It's not India's fault.
[63:10] It's not Europe's fault. Nobody made the
[63:14] monetary policies that the US followed
[63:16] that caused this
[63:18] de-industrialization. It's was
[63:20] self-inflicted. It was the US that chose
[63:23] to take advantage of the US dollar,
[63:24] print the US dollar, financialize its
[63:27] economy, and then make it so that the
[63:30] most productive career in the US is for
[63:32] people to get into the money printing
[63:34] business, to get into the banking
[63:35] business. And so all the smart kids in
[63:37] the US want to get into finance to move
[63:40] digital money around enough to keep
[63:43] making more and more money. So you lend
[63:45] me, I lend you, and then we both make
[63:47] interest. And all these corporations are
[63:49] just out there moving Federal Reserve uh
[63:52] script around and collecting a little
[63:55] bit of a uh a little bit of a commission
[63:58] on all this.
[64:00] Yeah. And it's and and and and it's
[64:02] increasingly um the the case because if
[64:06] you have any other kind of job, it
[64:08] doesn't matter what you do with that job
[64:10] compared to how you invest the money. So
[64:12] you could be the best engineer, but if
[64:14] you don't know how to invest your
[64:16] earnings from engineering, you're going
[64:18] to end up broke. But if you do know how
[64:21] to invest your earnings from
[64:22] engineering, then you don't even need to
[64:24] be an engineer. Just focus on investing
[64:26] your money. So the idea of having the
[64:29] smartest, most qualified people get into
[64:31] these productive fields is not um is not
[64:36] really taking place in places like the
[64:39] US, particularly in the US because of
[64:41] the fiat inflation, because of the money
[64:43] printing that's making the finance
[64:45] industry so much more profitable than
[64:48] every single other industry. That's
[64:50] ultimately what it is about. And lashing
[64:52] out at China or Canada or Mexico or any
[64:55] other country about this isn't going to
[64:58] change it. It's only going to exacerbate
[65:00] it because it's going to make you think
[65:03] that the real cause of the problem is
[65:05] not the cause of the problem and that
[65:06] the cause of the problem is some foreign
[65:08] country. And all of these tariffs that
[65:10] they're going to introduce are only
[65:11] going to make things worse. They're only
[65:13] going to exacerbate the problem. They're
[65:15] not going to fix the problem. And and I
[65:17] think uh you know fundamentally you know
[65:20] what people tell me is oh what do you
[65:22] have against America first? Every
[65:23] country should put themselves first.
[65:25] Well that's what they have been doing
[65:26] and and now you don't like it. Uh so it
[65:29] seems like yeah every other country
[65:30] should put themselves first as long as
[65:32] they're still beneath the US. Uh you
[65:35] know I'm a believer in uh you know
[65:38] competition and if you win you win. Uh I
[65:42] I it you know yeah to your point when
[65:44] you devolve into whining financially as
[65:46] you're saying geopolitically right
[65:48] what's oh you know China wants to have a
[65:50] base uh off the coast of um East Africa
[65:55] that's too close to the US they say was
[65:58] the whole world I mean like like you
[66:00] know how far away does it have to be I
[66:02] mean like really the coast of East
[66:04] Africa
[66:06] um and it is just like yeah we get it
[66:09] like you want to write the game and the
[66:11] world has gotten together and I think I
[66:13] mean India is another country where I
[66:14] see more people are proud to be Indian.
[66:16] Fewer of them want to leave. Obviously
[66:18] there's always people who want to leave
[66:20] any country. I mean there's record
[66:21] numbers of people doing as I did and
[66:22] giving up US citizenship. There's more
[66:24] people than ever living as expats
[66:26] outside of the United States. But I
[66:28] think what you're seeing in some of
[66:29] these large economies is more people are
[66:32] proud to be from there. They're staying
[66:34] there. Um and you know that's going to
[66:37] be incredibly powerful for their
[66:39] countries. And by the way, uh this whole
[66:41] crackdown now I see that um you know the
[66:43] current US administration they want to
[66:45] you know keep out more countries. Was it
[66:47] uh Haiti and Cuba? Um I thought you know
[66:50] those are you know the Cubans and
[66:52] especially people that contributed. Uh
[66:54] they want to make it tougher for Indians
[66:55] to get in. I mean there's certain people
[66:57] from India that are just now having
[66:59] appointments with the US embassy for a
[67:02] green card that were scheduled in the
[67:04] year
[67:04] 2000. You want to make it even harder
[67:06] than that? And then you want to wonder
[67:08] if people are going to have talent. And
[67:10] by the way, what didn't exist when we
[67:11] were kids, uh,
[67:13] Dubai, right? So now you have what I'm
[67:16] in, the citizenship by investment
[67:18] industry. You can go to Dubai as an
[67:19] Indian or as a Chinese citizen or from
[67:21] wherever. You can live there if you have
[67:24] a salary taxree. If you have a business,
[67:26] very low tax, if you have your Bitcoin,
[67:28] zero tax. Uh, and uh, you may not get a
[67:32] citizenship, but you can pair that. You
[67:34] can get a citizenship somewhere else if
[67:35] you want to expand your travel
[67:36] privileges. Now, you might lose your
[67:38] home if you're Indian. You can't have
[67:39] two. So, you have to get the OCI card.
[67:41] Uh but you could still, you know, you
[67:43] could still be able to live and work in
[67:44] India. You can still be able to travel
[67:45] as a as a, you know, Caribbean citizen,
[67:48] for example. And you can live in Dubai
[67:49] and pay zero tax. And by the way, uh you
[67:52] know, I'm I'm going to go and get my uh
[67:55] golden visa back. Um I have one in the
[67:58] UAE. I don't really spend time there,
[67:59] but I said, "Okay, I'll get a 10-year
[68:00] Golden Visa." You go and you're done in
[68:02] like three days. Now, if you want to
[68:04] live there, I didn't think there are
[68:05] some tax consequences, less so for
[68:07] Bitcoiners. But if you're an
[68:08] entrepreneur, you need to do some tax
[68:10] planning. But just to have a residence
[68:11] permit based on buying a property or
[68:14] putting money in the bank or whatever
[68:15] you want to do, uh, it's pretty neutral.
[68:18] I mean, they rush you through. Why would
[68:19] you go and deal with the US and so
[68:22] you're going to have less and less
[68:22] talent? And by the way, what did we just
[68:24] see recently? The entire population
[68:26] growth of the US for the first time is
[68:29] exclusively from immigration.
[68:32] Yeah.
[68:34] And yet and yet again, what do we hold
[68:36] on? What do what do the people in the
[68:37] United States hold on to? What are the
[68:38] comments that I get from people who I
[68:40] don't believe get it? Everyone wants to
[68:42] come here. Nobody's successful that I
[68:44] know when we film our Live Like a King
[68:46] series. I talk to business owners. I
[68:48] talk to Miss Universe. I talk to
[68:49] whomever. Would you like to move to the
[68:51] US? No. I have my cookie brand here. My
[68:54] family lives here. I'm making 100 grand.
[68:56] Life's good. I don't need to do that
[68:58] anymore. So, who wants to move?
[69:01] you know, people who are
[69:04] destitute. And I listen, I'm sure some
[69:06] of those people perhaps put in a good
[69:08] engine of competition could build
[69:10] something great or their kids build
[69:11] something great. I'm all for equal
[69:13] opport. I truly am. And I I love those
[69:15] stories. But, you know, the average
[69:18] person fleeing the violence created by
[69:20] the United States in El Salvador or
[69:22] Honduras, uh, is going to go and they're
[69:24] going to engage in unskilled labor. And
[69:26] that's who you're saying is, you know,
[69:29] that that's the reason your country is
[69:30] so great that that person wants to move
[69:32] there. Yeah. You know what? If you came
[69:33] and put the drug uh, you know, your
[69:36] country does drugs and you ran you
[69:38] rerouted the drug route through those
[69:40] people's countries and created violence.
[69:42] Yeah. I guess I guess they'd want to
[69:43] move too. Don't pat yourself on the back
[69:45] so much is my point. Uh, that's the
[69:48] entire population grows with the
[69:49] country. You're going to see fewer
[69:51] people. um it's going to be a knock on
[69:54] effect that fewer of the the talented
[69:56] people want want to go there. Why would
[69:58] you? You can go to
[70:01] Dubai. Yeah, it's very true. It's um
[70:05] it's increasingly um becoming like that.
[70:07] You know, one fascinating uh experience
[70:09] I had recently last year, I applied for
[70:12] a visa to Canada and a visa to the
[70:14] United Arab Emirates. The United Arab
[70:16] Emirates application took 3 minutes.
[70:18] just write your name and upload the
[70:21] passport and then you get it by email
[70:23] and that's it. The application for
[70:25] Canada was practically a part-time job.
[70:28] I had to prepare a list of every single
[70:31] trip that I've made in the last 10 years
[70:34] and I had to fill out incredibly
[70:37] complicated forms and then the forms
[70:39] wouldn't compile the way that they
[70:40] wanted them to compile and it just had
[70:42] to try so many different computers and
[70:45] software programs. The entire thing was
[70:47] just such an ordeal and then I didn't
[70:49] manage to finish it on time and I
[70:51] couldn't even travel. But it's
[70:54] incredible.
[70:55] Yeah, it takes forever. But what's truly
[70:57] incredible here is that Canada is the
[70:59] country that has an immigration problem
[71:01] and they have this incredibly
[71:03] complicated visa process. The Emirates
[71:06] doesn't have an immigration problem and
[71:08] their visa is very simple. And it's
[71:11] really telling because efficiency
[71:13] doesn't, you know, being able to do
[71:16] things correctly is all about being able
[71:17] to do them efficiently. It's not about
[71:19] having the doing them elaborately. So
[71:22] you have this incredibly complex
[71:24] immigration and application and visa
[71:26] process for a place like Canada, but
[71:29] it's completely dysfunctional and you
[71:30] have a lot of illegals and in every and
[71:33] and it falls apart in every way and it
[71:35] punishes the people that are not um
[71:38] trying to do anything illegal that end
[71:40] up just having to go through all kinds
[71:41] of meaningless because here's the UAE
[71:43] standard. We don't want criminals and
[71:45] we're tough on crime. You know what I
[71:46] mean? You don't you don't want to be a
[71:47] criminal the UAE and we don't want
[71:49] people who are going to come and work
[71:50] illegally. By the way, we we don't
[71:51] really allow that to happen to the same
[71:53] extent. Everybody else, oh, you have
[71:54] money coming on in. Why wouldn't we let
[71:56] you spend your money here? Most
[71:58] countries, and this is what I think
[71:59] people should know, most countries, in
[72:00] my opinion, are non-judgmental. I I've
[72:02] used a couple different passports to go
[72:04] to Singapore. I used an African passport
[72:06] once. The guy pulled the
[72:10] list 30 days. All right. I mean, you
[72:14] know, I gave up US citizenship and we
[72:16] help, you know, we have clients who've
[72:17] been back to the US. they've gotten
[72:18] visas or they have a good passport, you
[72:20] know, they got their Irish citizenship
[72:22] by descent and they go back and they
[72:23] don't have any problems. For a loudmouth
[72:25] like myself, uh I don't want to go back.
[72:28] But I do wonder if I went and said,
[72:29] "Hello, I'd like to get a US visa." I
[72:31] think they're one of the few judgmental
[72:33] countries. They'd be like, "You say bad
[72:35] things about us on YouTube." And I I I
[72:39] you know, I really wonder. I think it
[72:41] would be difficult for me. I'm not
[72:43] saying if you're, you know, the average
[72:44] person, but for me, uh, I thought we had
[72:47] freedom of speech, which, by the way,
[72:48] even today I I forget what it was, but
[72:50] there's every day there's some new
[72:52] example of how freedom of speech is for
[72:53] fewer and fewer people. It's a mirage at
[72:56] this point. I mean, Julian Assange, it
[72:57] wasn't for him. They outright said it.
[73:00] Um, now they're arguing, oh, it's the um
[73:02] it's the anti-Palestine protesters. No
[73:04] one has a right to a green card. If you
[73:06] say things against Israel, we're going
[73:08] to revoke your green card. there's no
[73:10] basis in law. But Marco Rubio literally
[73:12] said, "You don't you don't have a right
[73:14] to freedom of speech." I thought that
[73:15] was kind of the whole purpose of the c
[73:17] that in competition that were the whole
[73:19] two things the country was about. And
[73:20] apparently neither one exists anymore.
[73:23] Um and so yeah, I mean the UAE isn't
[73:27] there to judge you. They don't care what
[73:28] passport you are. They care are you not
[73:30] a criminal and are you not going to
[73:32] overstay and are you not going to like
[73:34] work illegally? That's that's it. It's
[73:35] not like, yeah, do we like what you say?
[73:40] Well, I mean, I guess they, you know, if
[73:42] you if you were to discuss the politics
[73:44] of the UAE that in the UAE's case
[73:48] perhaps,
[73:49] yeah, and I think countries to be fair,
[73:53] to what I do to the US, if I said that,
[73:55] if I said like I've said, I don't I
[73:57] said, listen, I don't live in Dubai and
[73:58] here's why. I mean, really much
[74:01] different. I I get your point. Yeah.
[74:04] Yeah. I think you could say whatever you
[74:06] want about Dubai in general. I don't
[74:08] think they would bother you. But uh I
[74:10] think the issue is if you would get into
[74:12] the local politics and if you But I mean
[74:16] I always use this as an example. So you
[74:18] know Lebanon is a place with very
[74:20] contentious, very bitter politics all
[74:22] the time and people are always fighting
[74:24] about politics there. And yet the
[74:26] majority of Lebanese people would pack
[74:28] up and leave and go to Dubai if they got
[74:30] an opportunity. Many Lebanese people
[74:31] live in Dubai and many more would go if
[74:34] they had the chance. And you go to Dubai
[74:35] and you can't talk about politics and
[74:37] you're told from day one, you know, if
[74:38] you want to stay here, you want to keep
[74:39] your contract, just don't discuss
[74:41] politics. And you know what? It's a
[74:43] winning trade. You lose a vote in a
[74:45] meaningless election choosing between a
[74:47] bunch of sociopaths. But you get clean
[74:50] streets, safety, security. And the
[74:54] reason it works is not because your
[74:57] input is needed. For the same reason
[74:58] that you know your laptop is being
[75:01] built, not because Apple is out there
[75:04] asking you what you think. They're not
[75:05] out there organizing votes for their
[75:08] customers to tell them how to make the
[75:10] next iPhone. They go out there and they
[75:13] use their knowledge to make the best
[75:14] iPhone. And you only have a choice as a
[75:18] customer. You can choose to buy it or
[75:20] not. That's how Apple makes the best
[75:22] phones. That's how everything gets made.
[75:24] It's not because of democratic
[75:26] consultation where every single person
[75:28] has to give in their opinion. It's
[75:30] because everybody can choose to buy or
[75:33] not buy. The best running countries
[75:34] right now are these are these
[75:35] monarchies. And so I'm I'm very pro-
[75:38] freedom. Always have been. Uh but I'll
[75:41] tell you one of the things that I've you
[75:43] know after a long enough time being out
[75:44] of the US, I don't think they apply the
[75:46] first amendment uh that well in the US
[75:49] anymore. But I ask myself in the first
[75:51] amendment freedom of speech, uh, you
[75:53] know, when I'm in Oman or when I'm in
[75:55] the UAE or when I'm in Malaysia, okay,
[75:57] listen, there's probably some things you
[75:58] shouldn't say. If I float above that
[76:00] society and I have my own life and they
[76:02] just run it and they run it well and
[76:04] it's much better than where I came from
[76:06] and I they leave me alone, do I want to
[76:08] go out and protest in the streets?
[76:10] Singapore, the same thing. Am I going to
[76:11] move to Singapore so that I can find a
[76:14] grievance? And I think some people if
[76:17] they didn't have the grievance, their
[76:18] life would be miserable. Same thing with
[76:20] the second amendment. Okay, I you know I
[76:22] used to go to the gun range in the US. I
[76:23] think people don't know that about me,
[76:24] but I would go to the gun range and
[76:25] okay, I respect fine. I'm all for it.
[76:28] But if your thing is I won't move where
[76:30] I where I can't have guns because I'm
[76:32] worried about my safety. How am I going
[76:33] to defend myself? Yeah. Uh in most the
[76:36] places that we're talking about,
[76:37] especially in a Dubai or in Oman, uh
[76:40] defend yourself from what? Like is the
[76:42] goal to have the right to defend
[76:44] yourself or what if you knew what if it
[76:46] what if you knew with certainty you
[76:48] would never have to defend yourself?
[76:49] Would you still want to be able to?
[76:53] Yeah, it's a different way of doing it.
[76:56] I but so I you know am I saying oh no
[76:58] I'm I'm Andrew Henderson is not for
[77:00] freedom? No, I'm not saying that. But I
[77:02] it certainly raises the question like
[77:04] you know at a certain point we're going
[77:06] to die and it's like was life
[77:10] well-lived? Were we was our focus on
[77:13] having a happy life where we had the
[77:15] freedom to go about our day-to-day
[77:16] lives, run our businesses, keep our
[77:19] money, you know, do the right things. Uh
[77:22] or was it like, you know, something
[77:24] written down in a piece of paper? And
[77:25] it's a question I ask myself more and
[77:29] more. Yeah, I think really the um the
[77:33] governance model that is built on people
[77:37] being able to choose is a much better
[77:39] model. And I think this is what you do.
[77:42] This is basically your business model is
[77:44] to give people the idea of thinking of
[77:46] where they live as being a choice that
[77:49] you make like the laptop that you buy.
[77:51] So when you decide whether you're going
[77:52] to buy a Dell or an Apple, you figure
[77:54] out which one works best for you and you
[77:56] buy it. And that gives them the
[77:58] incentive to give you the best laptop
[78:00] because they can't count on you buying
[78:03] their product forever unless they give
[78:06] you they have to earn it with every
[78:08] single product that you buy. So the way
[78:11] that I see it is with these governments
[78:13] like the Gulf States, they've
[78:15] effectively
[78:17] um operate under this model because the
[78:19] majority of their population are
[78:21] foreigners. And so in order for Dubai to
[78:24] function, it needs foreigners to buy in,
[78:26] to come in here. And that means you have
[78:29] to create a legal and um economic
[78:32] environment that is attractive enough
[78:34] for millions of foreigners to want to
[78:36] willingly come here. And that's exactly
[78:38] what they've done. So because they've
[78:40] had to recruit people, they've had to
[78:42] develop their laws and their rules and
[78:44] their market institutions in a way that
[78:47] would appeal to foreigners. And so that
[78:49] makes them operate like a business. So
[78:51] for them, government is like iPhones for
[78:56] Apple. They need to figure out how to
[78:58] make the iPhone in the cheapest way, in
[79:00] the best way, in the most uh desirable
[79:02] way for the customers. And similarly,
[79:04] that's the case for these countries that
[79:06] are predominantly occupied,
[79:08] predominantly inhabited by foreigners.
[79:10] They need to make these countries
[79:11] attractive for foreigners. It's a very
[79:13] different business model than if you're
[79:14] France or u Canada or the US where
[79:18] you've got a captive monopoly. Yeah. Uh
[79:21] population where you they have no choice
[79:24] more more or less that you know tens of
[79:26] millions of people are stuck there.
[79:28] They've been there for generations and
[79:29] they want to stay there for generations
[79:31] and so they're going to buy whatever
[79:32] crap you feed them. Well that's because
[79:34] I don't want to identify as anything. Oh
[79:36] we're French. We're not and people
[79:38] really hold on to it like you can you
[79:40] can you can be a you can turn tail and
[79:43] run. Everything it's by even the media
[79:46] they're fleeing. Listen they're
[79:48] stopping. They're making a B. I work
[79:49] with these people. They're making
[79:51] methodical decisions saying, "This
[79:53] doesn't work for me. This doesn't feel
[79:54] right. I need to figure out something
[79:56] else. I want to go where I'm treated
[79:57] best." Those are the five magic words.
[80:00] And uh yeah, I I I I think it's about I
[80:04] mean, this is kind of the whole another
[80:06] American ideal, by the way, was people
[80:08] came from somewhere. I went and retraced
[80:10] my uh Welsh ancestors. Uh not everyone
[80:13] wanted them to leave. It wasn't like,
[80:15] "Yeah, this place sucks and the US
[80:17] sounds a lot better." It was like,
[80:19] "What's wrong with you?" Um, and so it's
[80:22] always like that. Uh, I I Yeah, I I I
[80:26] think those who get it get it. And by
[80:27] the way, uh, oh, they can only do that
[80:29] because they have oil. Cool. You're a
[80:31] consumer. What do you care? Like when
[80:33] when you can buy stuff on an app and you
[80:35] think, "How are they making money on
[80:36] that?" Do you not buy it? No. You buy it
[80:39] as a consumer, you take advantage of it.
[80:41] But because we have to have these
[80:43] identities. Oh, I'm an American so why
[80:45] don't you know I'm not going to and and
[80:47] then they that's why they have to keep
[80:48] the propaganda going because if you
[80:50] think China's a better deal, you might
[80:52] want to go there. No, we have to have
[80:54] enemies. And that's for me why I like
[80:56] let's say a citizenship by investment.
[80:58] Who you know who are you going to choose
[81:00] if you're a dual citizen in time of war?
[81:02] Yes, the yes, the great St. Lucia Naru
[81:06] war that's brewing any day now. Uh no,
[81:08] they don't get into wars. They don't
[81:10] have to use propaganda. They're not big
[81:11] enough to. And on a more livable scale,
[81:13] the Dubai and I think Saudi Arabia is
[81:16] the next one that really interests me.
[81:18] Um, they've realized, yeah, we want to
[81:20] be successful. I don't I mean, the idea
[81:22] of not serving the of having a a
[81:25] football match and saying we're not
[81:27] going to serve alcohol seems odd to me u
[81:30] why you would bid for that, but okay. I
[81:33] mean, people are going to come and
[81:33] they're going to see it's better than
[81:34] they thought. Um,
[81:37] it worked out great in clutter. Actually
[81:39] turned out to be a lot more fun um when
[81:42] people just focus on the football rather
[81:43] than get smashed and start fighting each
[81:45] other. Yeah. Well, you can you can come
[81:48] to Nomad Capital Live. You don't get
[81:50] smashed after the event.
[81:53] Yes. Yes. I look forward to seeing you
[81:56] in September uh in Koala Lumpur at Nomad
[81:59] Capitalist Live and No Visa. It's part
[82:02] of why we do it there. You're very
[82:05] welcome in Malaysia. That's true. Yeah.
[82:08] Yeah. All right. U anything else you
[82:11] want to tell us about uh what you've
[82:13] been up to? No, I listen I I think that
[82:16] um for me neutrality's been a big thing.
[82:20] We've talked in recent years including
[82:22] at the event about multiparity. I think
[82:24] the world is um it you know it's it's
[82:28] more fractuous. And what I've said for
[82:29] years you know people say what's the
[82:31] next big place? The next big place is
[82:33] some place they're making fun of right
[82:34] now. You know, Jimmy, into your comment
[82:36] on on Dubai. I mean, again, back when
[82:38] they were making fun of the Kia, it
[82:40] wasn't as good of a car as as it is now.
[82:42] They were making fun of Dubai. It was a
[82:44] joke. I don't know, has it been the last
[82:46] 5, 10 years, it's kind of become a
[82:48] pretty wellrespected, accepted place for
[82:50] a lot of serious people. But it was a
[82:51] joke. And so, you know, what I like to
[82:54] help people do is find the next places.
[82:56] One of the things that we're going to be
[82:57] talking about this year at the event,
[82:58] we've had a couple people talking about
[83:00] Africa. I'm not saying you should move
[83:01] to Africa, but I think there's
[83:03] interesting investments there. And as
[83:05] your third or fourth passport, I
[83:07] wouldn't be opposed if the conditions
[83:08] were right to having certain African
[83:09] passports. Um, there's some new deals
[83:12] potentially on on some passport
[83:14] opportunities there. Um, and yeah,
[83:17] people laugh at that. They laugh at
[83:19] Dubai. They laughed at the US at one
[83:22] point. And I think that uh you know, you
[83:25] can go to Singapore and you can pay tens
[83:27] of millions of dollars to get in there
[83:28] as a passive investor now, but Singapore
[83:30] is largely closed for the average
[83:31] person. Um you want to go to a place
[83:34] that they're kind of laughing at. And I
[83:35] think that's kind of, you know, if
[83:36] you're going to go where you're treated
[83:38] best, I mean that kind of you have to
[83:40] kind of take a little bit of a leap of
[83:41] faith, which is why I think you should
[83:42] have different places. And if you're in
[83:44] Bitcoin, um I think you can never have
[83:47] too many options. uh especially as we're
[83:49] seeing uh maybe the US doesn't do as
[83:52] much for the next couple years, but I
[83:53] mean they're looking at asset registries
[83:55] and all kinds of stuff. I want to have
[83:57] neutral passports. I want to have
[83:58] neutral residences. I want to have ties
[84:00] to different places to where I can
[84:01] pivot. Um I it's not about being
[84:05] patriotic. I want to be able to pivot
[84:07] when times get tough from one to the
[84:09] other because you can't rely on your
[84:12] government. Uh you you you know
[84:14] politicians and governments I don't I
[84:16] don't trust them. Um and and so we have
[84:19] it comes back to being competitive.
[84:21] That's what we talk about in our
[84:22] business. That's what we help our
[84:24] clients do and it's what we talk about
[84:25] at Nomad Capitalist Live. So I I again
[84:27] looking forward to having you.
[84:30] Thank you, sir. You know what you said
[84:32] uh rings true with me. One of my mottos
[84:34] in life is to go where the idiots the
[84:38] loudest. It's served me very well in
