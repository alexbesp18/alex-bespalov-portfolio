[00:05] Hello, welcome to the Bitcoin Standard
[00:06] podcast. Our guest today is for the
[00:09] third time Jack Mers, the CEO of Strike
[00:12] and now the CEO of another company 21.
[00:16] While most of you are sitting in your
[00:17] mom's basements doing nothing. Jack is
[00:19] now CEO of two companies. And the second
[00:22] company is out there to buy as much
[00:24] Bitcoin as it possibly can, aiming to
[00:27] buy more Bitcoin than Michael Sailor.
[00:29] Talk about a tall order. Always fun to
[00:32] have you here, Jack. How you doing? You
[00:34] are the best, my friend. I am fantastic.
[00:36] Good to see you. How are you? I'm very
[00:38] good. Very good. Happy to see you and
[00:40] happy to hear about all your great news
[00:41] as always. It's fun, man. You know, I
[00:44] listen to your podcast. I've been
[00:45] listening it for years. And so hearing
[00:47] the intro directed at me as opposed to
[00:49] when I'm walking in the grocery store
[00:50] having it in my ears, it's an honor. So
[00:52] yeah, what a fun time. I think we just
[00:54] hit all-time highs, at least in US
[00:56] dollar terms, for Bitcoin as well. So
[00:57] happy alltime high. What a time to be
[00:59] alive and stacking sats. Indeed. Happy
[01:02] alltime high. It's although I don't
[01:04] think we did hit alltime high. I think
[01:05] we came close but not quite. No, really.
[01:08] We're we're 109 something. Who knows?
[01:11] Well, a happy dollar debasement. Yeah.
[01:14] This this trade only goes one way. Yeah.
[01:17] So, how you been? Uh I'm good.
[01:19] Obviously, a little busy, but uh but I'm
[01:22] good. I think we're living through one
[01:24] of the most fascinating times in this
[01:26] fiat money story. To me, it feels like
[01:28] the unwind from this fiat regime and
[01:31] what was set up and uh continued through
[01:34] this world war era. Um I think it's
[01:37] unwinding fascinatingly and uh it's a
[01:40] great time to be working on Bitcoin.
[01:42] both there's money to be made, there's
[01:44] opportunity in starting businesses, but
[01:46] uh I also feel like I'm contributing to
[01:48] the world and playing my small small
[01:50] role in restoring, you know, prosperity
[01:52] to our species and hopefully
[01:54] contributing to a new era of human
[01:56] flourishing. So, I feel great. Sun's
[01:58] coming out in Chicago. I mean, a lot of
[02:00] ribe eyes. That's great. Chicago ribe
[02:02] eyes, man. I've got such fun memories of
[02:04] them. Some of the best in the world. Mid
[02:06] Midwest. Yep. Absolutely. It's the
[02:08] capital of ribe eyes. 100%. Yeah. It's
[02:12] one of the one of the rare things we're
[02:13] good at is uh agriculture commodities
[02:15] and and meat. Yeah. Although I guess I
[02:18] may have just annoyed a lot of my Texan
[02:20] fan base. No offense Texans, but your
[02:22] steaks are great, too. All of American
[02:24] stakes are great. I mean, honestly, it
[02:25] might be the, you know, when people talk
[02:27] about divine providence for Americans. I
[02:30] think practically speaking, that's just
[02:32] the stake. Really, that's the divine
[02:34] providence. Americans have the best
[02:36] stake. That's how God blessed you. Well,
[02:39] you know what's interesting is, you
[02:40] know, not that this is a political
[02:42] podcast. Whether you think Trump is
[02:43] great or not, I don't really give a
[02:44]  The reality is what he's trying to
[02:47] do is what America has to do, which is
[02:49] getting back to proof of work and
[02:51] producing its own materials and being
[02:53] part of trade without printed pieces of
[02:55] paper and with real goods and services.
[02:57] And America is actually rich with
[03:01] resources. We actually have plenty of
[03:03] food. We actually have plenty of energy,
[03:05] plenty of oil. We just have never
[03:07] thought to have to put in the proof of
[03:09] work to produce it ourselves over the
[03:11] last hundred years. So, I'm excited. I
[03:13] agree with you. I think America has
[03:14] great food, great access to energy,
[03:16] great minds, a great population that is
[03:18] willing to work hard given it has to.
[03:21] And so, I think folks like Chicago, you
[03:24] know, hopefully we can export some st
[03:26] some of our stakes to to the rest of the
[03:28] world one day um and be part of real
[03:30] global trade as opposed to printing
[03:32] pieces of paper and exporting those.
[03:34] Well, I mean, America exports a lot of
[03:36] steak. I think uh that's one of the main
[03:38] exports that China gets from the US.
[03:39] American steak. I think so, too. Yeah.
[03:41] Yeah. It's one of the some of the best
[03:42] in the world. I've had a lot of great
[03:43] steaks all over the world, but I think
[03:46] America is just the best because the the
[03:50] consistency and they just I I think they
[03:52] bred them for a very long time for a
[03:54] great taste that they come out really
[03:56] really well. It's um it's it's huge. But
[03:59] anyways, let's get back to Bitcoin. So,
[04:01] what is new in Strike? You guys are
[04:03] doing Bitcoin backed loans, huh? Yes.
[04:06] Yes. We've launched a Bitcoin
[04:07] collateralized lending service, which,
[04:10] you know, I wanted to be clear. For
[04:13] some, this is redundant, but you know,
[04:15] on Twitter, I need to make sure everyone
[04:17] at the margins understands there's no
[04:19] yield with this product. I mean, it has
[04:21] such a awful history full of scammers.
[04:25] There's no yield for depositors.
[04:26] depositors just get a very beautiful
[04:28] Bitcoin wallet that's fully reserved and
[04:32] it's a 50% LTV collateralized loan. So,
[04:34] it's overcolateralized. So, you get to
[04:36] draw half of your Bitcoin wealth out in
[04:38] cash and we offer a 12-month term and
[04:42] there's two style of loans. You can make
[04:44] monthly interest payments for the
[04:46] cheapest version of the product or we
[04:48] offer a version of the product called
[04:49] payment at maturity. Now, this is what I
[04:51] think is the best version of the product
[04:54] and the genius way to use your Bitcoin
[04:56] wealth is that you don't owe us any
[04:58] money until the end of the loan. You pay
[05:01] the APR plus the principal back after
[05:04] the 12 months. So, you don't actually
[05:05] need to pay us on a monthly basis.
[05:07] That's our most popular version of the
[05:09] product and it allows Bitcoiners to
[05:11] access their Bitcoin wealth without
[05:12] having to sell it and incur a capital
[05:14] gains event. And I think it's a huge
[05:15] deal. I mean, we are already offering
[05:18] Strike in over a 100red countries. So,
[05:21] no financial service that I know of can
[05:23] offer a loan credibly to billions of
[05:26] people in the world without credit
[05:28] checks on a mobile device. Um, I mean,
[05:30] if someone in Ghana needed to get a loan
[05:32] from me without Bitcoin, I'd have to
[05:34] assess a picture of their Ganaan
[05:35] property or something like that. It
[05:36] would be impossible. So, I think it's a
[05:39] huge deal. The fact that you can draw
[05:40] capital against an asset that's
[05:42] compounding annual growth rate is around
[05:44] 50%. Is a way to make the money printers
[05:48] work for you be on the positive side of
[05:50] this debt based monetary system. But I
[05:52] I'll pause there. Um and obviously at
[05:55] Strike we want to do it the right way.
[05:57] Um it is no rehypothecation. We'll
[06:00] launch a proof of reserves iteration of
[06:01] this product coming shortly and
[06:04] everything that whatever BlockFi and
[06:05] Celsius and Sam Bangman Freed were,
[06:08] we're the opposite and we want to
[06:10] provide Bitcoiners a trustworthy way to
[06:12] access this wealth without pardon with
[06:13] the STS. Nice. And also uh your
[06:17] financials are out last a few weeks ago,
[06:21] right? Yeah, we published some of them
[06:24] uh for a few reasons. one. I mean, we've
[06:26] just gotten big and we've achieved some
[06:29] pretty big milestones that I don't think
[06:30] the world has totally appreciated who we
[06:33] serve
[06:34] and why we serve who we serve. Also,
[06:38] becoming the CEO of 21, an entirely
[06:40] separate company that I co-founded, I
[06:42] wanted the world to know and especially
[06:44] our customers that Strike is doing
[06:46] phenomenally well and that starting
[06:48] another company had nothing to do with
[06:50] Strike and me shifting my focus. that I
[06:53] run two big successful companies. That's
[06:56] possible. I don't know who made the rule
[06:58] that you can only start one company. Um
[07:00] I'm defying that law. People are so
[07:02] shocked for some weird reason. You know,
[07:04] you can just do things. And so I wanted
[07:05] to let the world know, let our customers
[07:07] know we're doing great. Um extremely
[07:09] profitable, high margin business. We're
[07:11] actually going to announce uh our
[07:13] Bitcoin treasury uh within the next
[07:15] week. We're a top 20 holder. Um, as far
[07:17] as corporations, Bitcoin Treasury, we
[07:19] own thousands of Bitcoin at Strike and
[07:21] it's a great business and I wanted to
[07:23] make sure people have confidence in us.
[07:24] Um, and we give that level of
[07:26] transparency as well. Yeah. Let me just
[07:28] run through some of the numbers because
[07:29] it's pretty mind-boggling because uh,
[07:32] people just I don't think they quite
[07:34] realize how big Strike is because it's
[07:37] at this point you generated $6 billion
[07:39] in volume which is more than 600%
[07:42] year-over-year growth. Your gross profit
[07:45] margins are 85% with 0 spent on customer
[07:49] acquisitions. You're expecting 8 to nine
[07:51] figures in net profit in 2025 with a
[07:54] team of just five uh se sorry 75
[07:57] full-time employees
[08:00] approximately and you hold the majority
[08:02] of your balance sheet in Bitcoin. Pretty
[08:05] impressive stuff.
[08:07] Yeah. So, we'll make an official
[08:09] announcement, but Strike owns I actually
[08:12] don't know at this very second because
[08:13] we buy every day, but call it around
[08:14] 1,500 Bitcoin. So, our balance sheet has
[08:18] approaching, you know, hundreds of
[08:19] millions of dollars on it. That far
[08:21] exceeds the venture capital money we've
[08:23] raised and for 75 people, that's not too
[08:26] bad. Um, extremely profitable business.
[08:29] So, as we announced, we'll make anywhere
[08:32] between tens of millions to over hundred
[08:34] million dollars of cash flow this year
[08:36] from our operating company. It's a
[08:38] really interesting business in that the
[08:40] products we sell and the vision and the
[08:42] brand that we have built is very viral.
[08:44] So, we don't spend money on marketing at
[08:46] all. All of our customers are acquired
[08:48] organically, which is rare. We've been
[08:50] able to build products in 100 plus
[08:53] countries and acquire customers there
[08:55] without needing to pay a bunch of
[08:57] influencers to tell people to download
[08:59] our stuff, which I think is rare and
[09:01] cool and speaks to the quality of, you
[09:03] know, the vision we're selling. I mean,
[09:04] to be to be totally can. It just speaks
[09:06] to how powerful Bitcoin is. It's not
[09:07] that hard to sell something that's
[09:09] growing 50% a year against debasing
[09:12] pieces of paper. And so uh yeah and
[09:15] we're really emerging as you know one of
[09:18] the leaders of Bitcoin financial
[09:19] services globally and uh lean profitable
[09:22] stacking sats and uh we just I thought
[09:25] customers deserve to know our financial
[09:27] position how strong we are um and that
[09:30] the future of their financial services
[09:32] in the business is in really good hands
[09:34] and that I'm more than capable of
[09:35] running two businesses. That was a lot
[09:37] of the reason why we did that. Yeah. You
[09:39] know, I I there's a saying that I
[09:42] believe in very strongly, which is if
[09:43] you want something done, give it to a
[09:45] busy man. Um, somebody's got too much
[09:48] time on their hand, they're probably not
[09:49] going to finish something. But if
[09:50] they're very busy and they have a lot to
[09:52] do, they're going to figure out the
[09:53] easiest, smartest way to do it. 100%.
[09:57] Yeah. And I think one of the things I'm
[09:59] most proud of Strike, listen, we're
[10:01] disruptive because we're into Bitcoin.
[10:02] We're disruptive because we focus on
[10:04] Bitcoin and not shitcoins. We've done a
[10:06] lot of things. Well, one of the things
[10:08] that I'm most proud of is the culture.
[10:11] We've had a culture of we must be
[10:14] profitable. At one point as a founder, I
[10:17] realized venture capital um like kick
[10:21] the can down the road type of
[10:22] fundraising for unprofitable companies
[10:25] is a scam. It's It's a it's
[10:27] unjust to have these things exist in
[10:29] society. An unprofitable business to me
[10:32] means the company is consuming more from
[10:34] the world than they're producing value
[10:35] to the world. That's I did not
[10:38] want to be one of those people. And so
[10:41] we almost took it as a cultural
[10:42] cornerstone for us is we need to be
[10:44] profitable because that's the right
[10:45] thing to do for the world. We want to
[10:47] produce more value for the world than we
[10:49] take from the world. And so just like
[10:51] our hurdle rate internally is Bitcoin.
[10:53] If someone internally comes to me with a
[10:55] really, hey Jack, I got a really good
[10:57] idea. I want to start a new product. I
[10:58] want to hire a bunch of people. I say,
[11:00] well, is this thing you're going to
[11:02] start growing going to grow faster than
[11:04] 50% year-over-year? because you're
[11:06] competing against Bitcoin. And usually
[11:08] the answer is no. And so I say get out
[11:10] of my office because if you can't out
[11:12] compete Bitcoin, it's not going to get
[11:15] my time energy in our balance sheet.
[11:17] Sorry. And so we've built a really
[11:19] strict culture that actually measures
[11:21] future success not based on a debasing
[11:24] dollar with infinite sloshes of venture
[11:26] capital money in Silicon Valley, but
[11:28] it's measured against Bitcoin. And so
[11:30] we've been very lean, profitable, more
[11:32] from a principled standpoint. like we
[11:34] find it a moral imperative to be
[11:37] profitable because it means we're doing
[11:38] good for the world on net and that's
[11:41] turned into an amazing business and so I
[11:42] think it's the restoration of ethics
[11:44] morals principles to building a startup
[11:47] that's one of the things I'm most proud
[11:49] of amongst some of the other stuff but I
[11:51] mean we're less than 100 people we got
[11:53] hundreds of millions of dollars on
[11:54] balance sheet producing profits and in
[11:57] extremely focused on our customers
[11:59] because we're measuring ourselves
[12:01] against Bitcoin and we have you know
[12:03] this really new age startup type of
[12:06] mentality and attitude as opposed to
[12:07] like infinite money printing Silicon
[12:10] Valley, you might as well lose hundreds
[12:12] of millions of dollars a year because
[12:13] you can go raise it again and buy
[12:14] billboards on the highway that no one
[12:16] actually cares about. Yeah. You know,
[12:18] one way uh one way I like to think about
[12:20] the Austrian business cycle theory, and
[12:21] I'm not sure there are other economists
[12:23] who discussed it in those terms, but
[12:26] ultimately what it comes down to is that
[12:28] when the money is devaluing, holding
[12:30] cash has a return of let's say 5%. So
[12:33] now you just created an enormous um
[12:36] business opportunity for businesses that
[12:38] are making a real return of betweeng 5
[12:41] and 0% to appear nominally profitable.
[12:44] That's all that the Keynesians are
[12:45] doing. They're taking businesses that
[12:47] are actually destroying capital negative
[12:48] 3% and negative 4%. But by destroying
[12:51] your capital more through inflation, it
[12:53] makes it profitable for you to engage in
[12:55] it. So they're taking away 5% from you.
[12:57] But if you put it in a bad business that
[12:59] is destroying only 4%. Then that's good.
[13:02] So suddenly now instead of just holding
[13:04] cash and waiting until you get to find a
[13:06] business that's going to pay you 5%
[13:08] positive or 10% or an opportunity that
[13:10] maybe gives you 20 20%. you are much
[13:14] more likely to go and find whatever
[13:16] opportunity even if you expect it to
[13:17] give you negative3 and negative4. So
[13:19] that's how the capital's destroyed and
[13:20] it's amazing uh so many bitcoiners tell
[13:23] me the same thing that you just said
[13:24] that once you start shifting into a
[13:26] world in which the money is appreciating
[13:29] then that's gone and now suddenly you
[13:31] have much higher standards -3 is not
[13:33] going to cut it negative4 is not going
[13:34] to cut it but also three is not going to
[13:36] cut it. Four is not going to cut it. 10
[13:37] is not going to cut it. you need to
[13:39] really push yourself and you need to
[13:40] really do something that's worthwhile or
[13:42] at least try and be very lean to try and
[13:45] use as little capital as possible
[13:47] because you don't want to spend more
[13:51] capital than is necessary because the
[13:53] opportunity cost is you're going to miss
[13:54] out on Bitcoin's appreciation. So for me
[13:57] for instance on a personal level I mean
[13:59] obviously my website is nowhere near as
[14:01] big as strike but from day one it had to
[14:05] operate on a monthly cash flow positive
[14:08] basis. I just I you know I I started
[14:11] small and I started making revenue and I
[14:14] just made sure that pretty much every
[14:15] month I earned more than I spent and I
[14:17] had to just continue to do that so that
[14:19] I don't lose satoshi's and I think it's
[14:21] uh worked out um so far but yeah the
[14:24] it's it's an entire mentality shift
[14:26] compared to living in fiat world where
[14:28] it's uh it's a race to who can destroy
[14:30] capital less than everybody else. The
[14:33] Bitcoin Standard podcast is brought to

[15:36] brought to you by the Daylight Computer.
[15:38] I love to work early in the morning and
[15:39] late at night or in the sun outdoors,
[15:41] but regular computer screens are
[15:43] terrible at these times and they strain
[15:45] your eyes. For years, I've wanted a
[15:47] paper-like electronic screen on a simple
[15:49] computer I could use to write. I tried
[15:52] several models, but none were very good.
[15:54] Now, finally, Daylight have delivered a
[15:57] fantastic full function tablet with a
[15:59] paper-like screen that's easy on your
[16:02] eyes and great for outdoor use. I've
[16:04] been using the Daylight computer to
[16:06] write my next book, and it is absolutely
[16:08] fantastic, and it has led me to invest
[16:10] in this company myself. Check out my
[16:13] interview with Anjan Kata in episode
[16:15] 249.
[16:17] Exactly. Yeah. I mean, for all the
[16:19] entrepreneurs out there, you know, take
[16:21] it from me. I This was my lived
[16:23] experience where to Safe's point, what
[16:26] you end up realizing at the end of the
[16:27] road is being profitable is actually a
[16:31] moral good for the world. Because what
[16:32] it actually means if if money is your
[16:34] time and energy in an abstracted form,
[16:36] it is the value and the labor and the
[16:38] effort that we all contribute to those
[16:39] around us abstracted in a market good.
[16:41] That's what money is. If that is and
[16:44] it's it's it measures who owes what to
[16:45] whom at the end of the
[16:47] day. Being profitable means you're
[16:49] delivering more value to those around
[16:52] you than you're consuming from the
[16:53] world. It is quite literally the
[16:54] financial way of saying you're making
[16:56] the world a better place. And so that
[16:58] should be the baseline goal for anyone
[17:01] starting anything. And anything that
[17:03] financially and mathematically isn't
[17:05] making the world a better place
[17:07] shouldn't exist. the free market should
[17:09] punish and crush and make these
[17:10] businesses, these ideas extinct because
[17:12] it's a net negative to the world. Now,
[17:14] when I was an entrepreneur and I first
[17:16] started out, I didn't understand all
[17:17] this. For those listening, I'm 31 years
[17:19] old. I got into Bitcoin when I was 18.
[17:21] And so, a kid when I started my
[17:23] entrepreneurial journey trying to wrap
[17:25] my head around what Satoshi had created.
[17:27] And I would say in the last market
[17:29] cycle, I had so much when you know the
[17:31] what went down with El Salvador and we
[17:34] integrated Lightning with Twitter, I had
[17:36] so much venture capital money thrown at
[17:37] me safe. There were a lot of people that
[17:39] liked the attention and liked the
[17:41] headlines that were around me. I didn't
[17:43] have the best people around me. And when
[17:45] the market corrected and the bare market
[17:47] happened, I I had to go through this
[17:49] experience very painfully on my own,
[17:51] which was am what I've built good for
[17:54] the world? Because we were losing money.
[17:56] We weren't we we had achieved a lot of
[17:58] headlines, a lot of Twitter followers, a
[18:00] lot of stuff, but we weren't cash flow
[18:02] positive. It was hard for me to really
[18:04] wrap my head around measuring what was
[18:07] good for the world if it was up to a
[18:09] venture capitalist to determine the
[18:10] value that I was building and the vision
[18:12] that I had embarked on. And what you you
[18:15] come to realize is, you know, measuring
[18:19] and future fundraises from venture
[18:21] capitalists in a depreciating currency.
[18:23] to Safedine's point, you know, it's it's
[18:26] it's a game of, you know, who can lose
[18:29] money in the most attractive way um
[18:32] under the negative 5%. So, I mean, even
[18:35] before we made these announcements, say,
[18:37] there was a blue chip Silicon Valley
[18:40] startup that published an article on
[18:42] TechCrunch, my chief of staff was like,
[18:44] "Hey, you got to read this article."
[18:45] It's funny because they're talking about
[18:47] their topline revenues and how much
[18:49] growth they've had and how much
[18:51] customers they've had, but at the very
[18:53] end of the article, they mention they're
[18:54] still not profitable and they need to
[18:56] raise money. And so, it's this whole
[18:58] article of like, we were making hundreds
[19:00] of millions of dollars in revenue. We're
[19:02] growing all this. We opened an office in
[19:04] London. We're amazing. Look at this uh
[19:06] like very um Christmas cardesque picture
[19:10] of our founding team. But at the very
[19:11] bottom, it's like, but we lose $50
[19:13] million a quarter and we need to raise
[19:15] money to survive. And that actually
[19:17] motivated me to publish our own numbers
[19:19] and talk about my experience as a
[19:21] founder in Bitcoin and realizing the
[19:23] fiat game is a muck and the topline
[19:26] revenues don't matter. The bottom line
[19:27] profits actually matter and that if you
[19:31] give people hundreds of millions of
[19:33] dollars of fiat, they're just going to
[19:34] puke it on marketing, on new products,
[19:37] on hiring a bunch of people. And uh
[19:40] yeah, it was it was through that
[19:41] experience that I I kind of pivoted. I
[19:43] changed the culture and the energy
[19:45] around Strike, what we were trying to
[19:47] do. And since then, it's been a rocket
[19:48] ship. Um so I'm thankful for those
[19:51] experiences. But for those entrepreneurs
[19:52] out there, hopefully you take it from me
[19:53] and you don't have to live it yourself.
[19:54] Um be profitable, which is a a moral
[19:57] good for the world. Um measure yourself
[19:59] in Bitcoin, not in dollars. Don't be
[20:01] part of the scam. Yeah, absolutely. No,
[20:04] I agree entirely on the the you know
[20:07] there's a lot of negative uh
[20:08] connotations to wealth and to capital
[20:10] accumulation that people have, but
[20:12] there's nothing better than turning a
[20:14] profit. Turning a profit means you're
[20:15] taking things that society values at X
[20:18] and then you're turning them into X plus
[20:20] something through the magic of economic
[20:22] production if you do it correctly. And
[20:25] that's just a good thing. You're getting
[20:26] rewarded for doing something valuable.
[20:29] You know, if if if you're buying
[20:31] everything voluntarily from people and
[20:32] if you're selling everything
[20:33] voluntarily, then you're by the
[20:36] admission of all the people paying you
[20:38] and buying from you and selling you,
[20:41] your subjective valuation of the goods
[20:43] that you produce is higher than the
[20:44] subjective valuation of the goods that
[20:46] you consume. So, you're doing something
[20:47] good. And if you're not turning a
[20:49] profit, then you're destroying capital.
[20:51] And this is, you know, it's it's morally
[20:53] good. It's good for your psychology.
[20:55] good for you as a person, but also it's
[20:59] I think what many people miss is that
[21:01] economic calculation, this is the point
[21:02] the Austrians keep uh harping on about.
[21:05] Economic calculation is what allows the
[21:07] coordination of economic production. So
[21:09] you shouldn't just think of profit as
[21:10] being good because it makes money. You
[21:11] should think of it as a as the compass
[21:14] that drives you to know what to do, what
[21:16] decisions to take. And it's just it's a
[21:18] blessing to have a market in that regard
[21:20] because it tells you, you know, you do
[21:23] this, then you don't make a lot of
[21:24] profit. It's telling you that's not
[21:26] good. Don't keep going that way. You're
[21:27] doing this other thing that's making
[21:28] profit. Keep going there. Double down on
[21:30] it. Invest on it more. Find out how you
[21:32] can make it better. Increase the
[21:34] quantity of uh products, decrease the
[21:38] Yeah. A story from Strike. So to
[21:41] continue the story I was telling, you
[21:43] know, we were focused, my initial theory
[21:45] was around lightning, and I think I'm
[21:47] right on the general trend of lightning.
[21:48] I was wrong on the timing. I thought it
[21:49] was going to happen a lot sooner than it
[21:51] has. And whatever, you're wrong
[21:53] sometimes. It's not a big deal. But
[21:55] really for me is, you know, I ended up
[21:57] taking the ego out of, you know, when I
[21:59] was a kid, I thought my job as a CEO of
[22:01] a company was to predict the future and
[22:03] know what's best for other people. And
[22:05] you realize that's just you being an
[22:07]  That's not your job. Your job
[22:08] is actually to listen to customers and
[22:12] build for what they want. And when we
[22:15] changed from we're going to try and make
[22:17] this lightning thing happen as fast as
[22:18] possible to Bitcoiners just want us to
[22:20] build Bitcoin financial services and who
[22:22] knows better what they want than them.
[22:25] That trick question, nobody. And as soon
[22:27] as we've I I went through this, you
[22:28] know, period with myself and we just
[22:30] started listening to our customers safe
[22:33] profits. We're just overflowing with
[22:34] profits and growth and positive
[22:36] feedback. And to your point, the market
[22:39] and customers have been our greatest
[22:41] guide. Uh, and it's been incredible for
[22:45] us. So anyway, um that is a real life
[22:49] story I lived through is just by
[22:51] listening to the market and being guided
[22:53] by profits, we've become an immensely
[22:56] customer focused business that's found
[22:57] our way into stacking sats and and
[22:59] growth and prosperity as a business as
[23:02] opposed to, you know, not being guided
[23:04] by capital allocation and formation. to
[23:06] your point. Yeah. I think that that
[23:09] whole notion of I know better than the
[23:10] market, this kind of u struggling artist
[23:13] who wants to produce the art that people
[23:15] don't value because people are stupid
[23:16] and they don't they don't know what art
[23:18] is is a perfect recipe for being
[23:20] miserable and depressed with the rest of
[23:21] your life. Uh embrace the people. Give
[23:24] the people what they want. Learn to like
[23:27] what they like. Your, you know, as I
[23:29] like to say, everything you want is on
[23:31] the other side of giving people what
[23:32] they want. Everything you want, you can
[23:34] get by giving people what they want. So,
[23:36] uh, take that ship off your shoulder and
[23:38] stop thinking that you know what's
[23:39] better for people than they do. It's
[23:41] taken the ego out of it. That's the
[23:42] culture we have at Strike. And actually,
[23:44] how we got to the lending product in the
[23:45] first place is because Bitcoiners were
[23:47] asking for it. And so, you could you
[23:50] could think, you know, lending in this
[23:52] industry as it's a dirty word. It's
[23:54] scary. There's past history of, you
[23:57] know, people getting burned with really
[23:59] shady criminals like Sam Bankman Freed.
[24:01] But for us, you know, Bitcoin started
[24:03] out with a market cap of zero. Now it
[24:05] has a market cap over$ two trillion
[24:06] dollars. So there's been trillions of
[24:08] dollars worth of wealth created for
[24:09] Bitcoiners. And they're all coming to us
[24:11] and saying, "We want a transparent,
[24:13] trustworthy way to borrow against the
[24:15] best performing asset in human history.
[24:17] And uh we think you can do it for us."
[24:19] And so again, it's taking the ego out of
[24:21] whatever I think the future will be
[24:23] doesn't matter. It's I'm in a position
[24:25] where I have the technology, the balance
[24:27] sheet, the team, the licenses, the
[24:29] distribution to provide financial
[24:31] services for Bitcoiners. and I shut up
[24:33] and I listen and I take my ego out of it
[24:36] and I flush it down the toilet. And so
[24:37] when they said there's no credible
[24:39] lending solution that's been done at
[24:41] scale with transparency,
[24:43] trustworthiness, with effective pricing
[24:45] and large pools of capital and uh that's
[24:47] what we built. So Strike's just been an
[24:50] iteration of Bitcoiners evolving as this
[24:52] industry grows to be honest. Yeah. No,
[24:55] absolutely. And so what is the u main u
[24:59] main source of revenue for Strike now?
[25:01] or is it just fees on transfers or
[25:04] buying Bitcoin? Yeah, our biggest
[25:06] business is the buy sell the brokerage
[25:09] product, but we're predominantly buy
[25:11] side. So, our customers don't sell a
[25:13] ton, they buy. Um, we have seen growth
[25:16] in selling as we've been able to grow
[25:18] and meet some demands, but we're
[25:20] actually already seeing a reduction in
[25:21] Bitcoin sales because these customers
[25:24] are borrowing against the asset instead,
[25:26] which is awesome. Uh, and we have other
[25:28] business lines. We have B2B products. We
[25:30] have an API. We do have our lightning
[25:32] business, but I would say our Bitcoin uh
[25:35] brokerage service is the biggest
[25:37] business line. Um the lending one is
[25:39] already growing a lot. It's been live
[25:41] for not even a month and it's a very
[25:44] popular product I think for obvious
[25:46] reasons. But it's predominantly this buy
[25:49] sell. And the last thing I think is
[25:51] interesting is you can kind of track
[25:53] what I think people misunderstand is
[25:55] yes, Bitcoin is for everyone. Yes, I
[25:57] think what's happening in Africa and
[25:58] Latin America is fascinating, but at the
[26:00] end of the day, Bitcoin is competing to
[26:02] store the world's cash balances. And
[26:04] where we've seen the most growth and the
[26:08] highest volume of business is in parts
[26:10] of the world with the largest cash
[26:11] balances, Bitcoin is a wealth transfer.
[26:13] And so, in order to track where it's
[26:15] most popular, you should just go where
[26:17] the wealth exists. So, our big biggest
[26:18] business line is the United States.
[26:20] After that is Europe and the UK. And
[26:22] then after that are a lot of the
[26:24] emerging markets. Um, and so I think
[26:26] it's very validating to see our numbers
[26:28] and see under the hood into our
[26:30] dashboards and realize that this is just
[26:32] a grand wealth transfer going on and
[26:34] people are recapitalizing their cash
[26:36] balances into this asset class from
[26:38] wherever uh US real estate, the UK stock
[26:41] market, etc., etc. Yeah, I think a lot
[26:44] of us uh initially thought that u
[26:47] Bitcoin is going to be a lot more
[26:49] popular in poor countries and countries
[26:50] that have high inflation. I think it's
[26:54] uh you know it would have been nice if
[26:57] Venezuelans and Lebanese and Zimbabwean
[26:59] people had stacked sats really hard over
[27:02] the last 5 10 years but I think you know
[27:05] from personal experience I just and I
[27:07] saw this in Lebanon firsthand and I see
[27:09] when I travel around and I talk to
[27:10] people in places like the US and Canada
[27:12] I think it turns out that ultimately at
[27:14] this point the real use case the real
[27:18] demand the real thing that is going to
[27:19] drive significant amount of interest in
[27:21] Bitcoin
[27:22] is demand for storing value in Bitcoin
[27:25] is for demand for cash balances. And
[27:27] that's just going to come from people
[27:28] who are used to saving, people who have
[27:30] savings, people have stock portfolios,
[27:32] who hold bonds, and who are financially
[27:35] savvy and who are just always have the
[27:38] ability to save for the future. And
[27:40] sadly, if you're in a place like
[27:41] Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Lebanon, if you've
[27:43] gone through hyperinflation, your um you
[27:46] know, your wealth has been destroyed and
[27:47] you don't have the lux well I I don't I
[27:51] wouldn't say you don't have the luxury.
[27:53] I think everybody should be thinking of
[27:54] the future, but uh it's much more
[27:57] difficult to think of the future in a
[27:58] place where you've had that and you
[27:59] don't have a lot of cash balances and
[28:00] you're trying to make ends meet for the
[28:02] end of the month. It's a lot harder to
[28:04] see serious demand for Bitcoin in these
[28:06] kind of situations and it's just the way
[28:08] it is ultimately. This is money and the
[28:11] money is going to end up in the hands of
[28:12] the people who have money. Exactly. And
[28:14] and one of the stats we released at
[28:17] Strike, our fastest growing customer
[28:19] cohort is actually the customer base
[28:21] that's doing 50 to $500,000 of volume
[28:23] with us a month. So these customers are
[28:26] doing millions of dollars of volume with
[28:28] us a year and that's our fastest growing
[28:30] customer base. So again, we do have
[28:32] customers all over the world. We are
[28:34] seeing growth in these Latin American
[28:36] African regions that are significantly
[28:37] poorer than Americans, but the fastest
[28:40] growing, the most volume. To safe's
[28:42] point, it's obvious. It's coming from
[28:43] the people that actually have the cash
[28:44] balances. Something that, you know, my
[28:46] mental model personally and extends to
[28:49] both my businesses is that, you know,
[28:51] humans own a little over $900 trillion
[28:54] worth of stuff. That's
[28:56] currencies, nation state debt, real
[28:58] estate, stocks, precious metals,
[29:01] collectibles, art, just all the stuff
[29:03] that we own in the world. And about half
[29:05] of that we've monetized as savings. So
[29:09] people own houses not necessarily to
[29:11] consume them and live in them, but to
[29:13] store and save their wealth. They own
[29:14] art, not necessarily to put in on their
[29:16] wall in their living room for their kids
[29:18] to throw spaghetti at, but they're using
[29:21] it as a savings account to store and
[29:22] persist wealth. And I think Bitcoin's
[29:24] competing over that 400 to500 trillion
[29:27] dollar opportunity. And so if you want
[29:28] to see where the wealth transfer is
[29:30] going to happen, you know, look under
[29:32] the hood to where the 400500 trillion
[29:34] worth of savings is looking for a
[29:36] potential new home. And that's not as
[29:39] much in Latin American Africa as it is
[29:42] in Manhattan, as it is in California, as
[29:46] it is in London. And that that's what we
[29:48] see in our numbers. And we see growth
[29:50] all over the place. Um, I think there's
[29:51] a different set of products that are
[29:52] appealing to the emerging markets, but
[29:54] yeah, it's very validating to understand
[29:57] where Bitcoin is appealing, why it's
[29:58] growing, and what's happening. The

[31:30] Yeah. What kind of products are you
[31:31] finding u most uh appealing in um um
[31:36] poorer countries? So what's fascinating
[31:39] is we integrated tether in this wallet
[31:44] that we we think of our product almost
[31:45] in two ways. We have the developed
[31:49] market product where US Europe UK we
[31:51] support the local currency and our suite
[31:53] of Bitcoin products. So we support the
[31:55] dollar, the euro, the pound and that's
[31:56] because these customers get their
[31:58] paychecks in in this product. It's these
[32:01] dollars and euros and pounds aren't
[32:03] going through necessarily
[32:04] hyperinflation. They go to the grocery
[32:05] store with it. It's fine. And they also,
[32:09] by the way, no one in America has ever I
[32:11] find this fascinating. No customer ever
[32:13] ever ever has asked us, I don't want you
[32:16] to integrate with my Chase Bank. I want
[32:18] you to integrate Tether for me in
[32:20] California. No one's ever told me that.
[32:22] So, I actually don't know who uses USDC
[32:25] or why. Cuz as an American, I have a
[32:27] Chase account. I have Cash App. I have
[32:29] Venmo. I have PayPal. Why would I need a
[32:32] stable coin? It's beyond me. And as
[32:34] someone who runs a big business in
[32:36] America, I've never heard a customer ask
[32:39] me for that. Now, outside of the
[32:41] developed world, Latin America, Africa,
[32:44] some parts of Eastern Asia, all we get
[32:47] is don't integrate with our banks. Our
[32:49] banks barely work. The technology here
[32:51] sucks. Give me Tether. Instead of the
[32:54] Ganaian SETI or the Nigerian Naira or
[32:56] the Turkish LRA and Bitcoin, I want a
[32:58] wallet with Tether and Bitcoin. And no
[33:01] one ever asked for USDC in these
[33:02] markets. It's only been Deather and I
[33:05] know they're the co-founder is now on a
[33:06] separate business with me so it's going
[33:08] to come off now as bias but this is a
[33:10] true story where we were like oh crap
[33:12] give the people what they want which is
[33:14] Tether and Bitcoin and that's the
[33:16] product that's gone viral in these other
[33:18] markets and we see a lot of the payments
[33:20] activity split between Tether and
[33:22] Bitcoin and a lot of the financial
[33:23] activity is interesting. I'm really
[33:25] excited to get our lending product to
[33:27] these markets because I'm stoked to give
[33:30] some of these poorer countries an
[33:31] ability to save an asset that's
[33:33] compounding at 50% on average and borrow
[33:35] tethers and that should I mean by
[33:37] accessing collateralized debt it
[33:39] actually should help people build
[33:41] wealth. But, you know, we'll see. But
[33:43] we're we're seeing pretty interesting
[33:44] behavior with the stable coins there.
[33:46] Um, and in Europe, no one's ever asked
[33:49] me for a tether or whatever. Yeah. Yeah.
[33:52] I mean, basically, if you've got a
[33:53] functioning USD bank account and USD
[33:55] credit card, you don't really need
[33:57] Tether. But the vast majority of the
[33:59] world doesn't. The vast majority of the
[34:01] world doesn't have that. So, I think
[34:02] there's an enormous market opportunity
[34:04] for Tether. It's been astonishing
[34:05] watching their growth. It really is. I
[34:07] was very skeptical that they could pull
[34:08] it off and they just keep delivering.
[34:11] Yeah. I mean, you know, I I think what
[34:14] people should know, I I've co-founded 21
[34:16] with Tether, so I've been friends with
[34:18] them for a really long time. I've been
[34:19] in Bitcoin for almost 13 years and
[34:21] they've been around just as long. And I
[34:24] say that to say everyone that was around
[34:26] back in the day, we're all friends
[34:27] because there just weren't that many
[34:28] people in Bitcoin. With that being said,
[34:30] I'm not a Tether employee. I don't speak
[34:33] on behalf of Tether. And by the way, I
[34:35] don't have an interest in their
[34:38] business, like their stable coin
[34:39] business at all. I'm speaking as the
[34:41] Strike Founder. People love their
[34:43] product and their product competes
[34:45] directly against these shitty currencies
[34:48] in these poor markets. It doesn't
[34:50] compete against Bitcoin in my opinion
[34:53] and from what I've seen at Strike. And
[34:55] so it's been remarkable to see the
[34:58] breadth of demand. I mean they have over
[35:01] 400 million active wallets which is
[35:04] insane. They have more active wallets
[35:06] than there are people in America which
[35:08] is outrageous. And so there's a clear
[35:10] demand for access to the dollar
[35:12] digitally in a convenient way. And screw
[35:15] Tether. I would say the private sector
[35:17] has figured that out where big
[35:19] government and stupid banks like Chase,
[35:22] you know, are slow, clunky. They've
[35:24] built their businesses on regulatory
[35:26] mode and access to the money printer as
[35:28] opposed to being technologist and
[35:30] customer focused and forward thinking.
[35:31] And so the private sector has figured
[35:33] out how to meet the demand of these poor
[35:36] countries that go through hyperinflation
[35:37] and have terrible central banks and and
[35:40] currencies and it's turned into who knew
[35:43] an amazing business that you know
[35:45] they're basically onboarding Argentine
[35:47] cab drivers onto US debt. And so now you
[35:51] know America loves it, the Argentine cab
[35:53] driver loves it and Tether takes the
[35:55] profits and plows it into Bitcoin and
[35:57] starts businesses with me like 21. So, I
[36:00] think it's fascinating, but you know,
[36:02] it's actually very logical when you
[36:04] think about it. They're just a full
[36:05] reserve bank that is actually
[36:06] technologically savvy and and ethical in
[36:09] my opinion. Yeah. And, you know, a lot
[36:12] of people in Bitcoin land like to uh
[36:15]  on Tether and say that, you know,
[36:16] it's a shitcoin. It it's a dollar. It's
[36:19] furthering dollar hedgeimony. And I can
[36:21] sort of sympathize with that. I'm no fan
[36:22] of the dollar and I'm no fan of Treasury
[36:24] bonds. But as I like to say it, you
[36:26] know, let he who is without a US dollar
[36:29] checking account and credit card cast
[36:32] the first stone. Um, everybody in
[36:34] today's world needs a US dollar bank
[36:37] account. Um, and you know, it's funny. A
[36:40] lot of the critics of Tether, they u
[36:43] they're not even uh they're not even
[36:45] into Bitcoin significantly. They buy
[36:47] maybe a little bit of Bitcoin, but
[36:49] ultimately no matter how much Bitcoin
[36:50] you have in today's world, you need to
[36:53] use fiat payments. You need to pay rent.
[36:55] You can't orange pill everybody. The
[36:58] size of Bitcoin cash balance is about
[36:59] 0.5% of all the world's cash balances.
[37:02] So every time you're trading with
[37:04] somebody, the expected value of Bitcoin
[37:06] on their balance sheet is about 0.5%. So
[37:10] almost certainly they're not going to
[37:11] want to buy and sell in Bitcoin. You
[37:13] know, somebody like me is a bit of an
[37:14] exception. My website mainly sells to
[37:16] Bitcoiners. So it's makes and and I hold
[37:20] a lot of Bitcoin and they hold a lot of
[37:21] cash balances in Bitcoin. So about a
[37:23] third to a half of my revenue comes from
[37:25] Bitcoin. Does that make sense? But if
[37:28] you're buying an Coiner good where you
[37:31] know you all the rest of the customers
[37:33] are also are not Bitcoiners and the
[37:36] business is not Bitcoiner, you can't
[37:38] orange pill them all so that you can
[37:40] spend your Bitcoin. Just get a checking
[37:41] account and use it and it's fine. It's
[37:44] uh it's it you can still call yourself a
[37:47] Bitcoiner and you're not going to kill
[37:49] Bitcoin by doing it because ultimately
[37:51] what matters is the size of the cash
[37:52] balances. That's how Bitcoin wins.
[37:54] That's really what matters. We need to
[37:55] stack SATs as hard as you can and
[37:57] inconveniencing yourself by um making it
[38:00] more expensive for you to engage in
[38:02] transactions by having to say pay
[38:04] physical cash so that you don't use the
[38:05] banks or whatever. you're just making it
[38:07] more expensive for you and therefore
[38:09] ending up stacking fewer sats and
[38:12] um making it take longer for Bitcoin to
[38:16] eat the dollar. Yeah. You know, I had a
[38:19] conversation with a customer in
[38:21] Argentina actually. This was years ago,
[38:23] but to get us at strike to the position
[38:26] we are, the customer is on Bitcoin
[38:29] Twitter and is seeing the rhetoric of
[38:30] Bitcoiners calling Tether Shitcoin and
[38:32] prolonging the dollar's hedgemony. And I
[38:35] also can sympathize with that as well. I
[38:37] was one of those people that held that
[38:38] opinion. What I would say though is the
[38:40] the customer came to me and was like,
[38:41] "Listen, man. You already support
[38:43] shitcoins. You support the dollar. You
[38:45] support the euro. You support the pound.
[38:48] Those are also shitcoins. And you
[38:50] support shitcoin rails, which is fed
[38:52] wire, which which is a which is SEPA,
[38:54] which is UK faster payment. So you
[38:56] support shitcoin rails and shitcoins
[38:58] already. Who are you to tell me, someone
[39:01] living in Argentina, that you can't
[39:04] support my preferred shitcoin rail,
[39:06] which is Tether? Like, who cares? Um,
[39:09] and go back to the Americans and say,
[39:11] "We're not going to support Fedwire.
[39:13] We're not going to support a not going
[39:14] to support your Chase bank account
[39:16] because they're shitcoins. Good luck
[39:18] then using Strike and having a smooth
[39:20] experience on boarding Bitcoin and god
[39:22] forbid you have an emergency medical
[39:23] surgery or you want to buy a house. Go
[39:25] screw yourself." and he was like,
[39:27] "Obviously that's not the right
[39:29] approach." So yes, Tether is a token um
[39:32] and it could be conflated with
[39:34] shitcoins, but the reality is why would
[39:36] you as a founder make me sit in the
[39:39] Argentine peso or make me use Binance? I
[39:41] want to use Strike and can you just
[39:44] support our preferred fiat shitcoin? And
[39:48] that conversation, I was like, "Oh,
[39:50] again, I need to take my ego out of
[39:52] this. It's not my job to decide how
[39:56] people in Argentina manage their
[39:58] finances and then marginally increase
[40:01] increase their Bitcoin cash balance
[40:02] based on their financial position.
[40:04] That's not my job. And by the way, no
[40:06] decision I make is going to encourage
[40:09] them to store more of their cash balance
[40:10] in Bitcoin. Like these decisions are
[40:12] made at the margin. And people are going
[40:15] to every single day we all wake up, we
[40:17] all do stuff for the world of value. And
[40:19] then we have a decision to make in real
[40:21] time. How do we want that value to be
[40:22] persisted and exchanged later? And
[40:25] people are going to have access to all
[40:26] sorts of tools to persist and store that
[40:28] value. And increasingly, people choose
[40:30] Bitcoin, but that's to safe's point,
[40:32] it's a process that's going to take time
[40:34] naturally. It's not going to go from two
[40:36] trillion to $200 trillion in 24 hours.
[40:39] And so that conversation, conversations
[40:42] like it really flipped my brain around
[40:44] and was like, "Oh man, my ego is in the
[40:46] way. I need to listen to these people."
[40:48] And they have a preferred shitcoin. Like
[40:50] I like using the wire system and the
[40:53] dollars in America. They like tether and
[40:55] whatever rails. Who gives a And it
[40:57] it's just helping them become
[40:59] Bitcoiners. Yeah, exactly. And yeah,
[41:01] that that's the key point. You said
[41:02] there's nothing you can do to make them
[41:03] get into Bitcoin. I don't I don't think
[41:05] so. Actually, I think remember what we
[41:07] were saying earlier. It's people that
[41:08] suffering from hyperinflation that are
[41:09] not able to get into Bitcoin because
[41:11] they don't have cash balances. Whereas
[41:13] people who do have access to the dollar
[41:15] and the euro and the relatively uh
[41:17] better uh fiat currencies, they're the
[41:19] ones that are able to maintain their
[41:21] cash balances relatively and so they can
[41:23] get into it. So when the Argentinians
[41:24] Yeah. when the Argentinians and the
[41:26] Turks and the Brazilians stop using
[41:27] their local shitcoin and they have a
[41:29] cash balance with uh the US dollars,
[41:31] they're going to become much more likely
[41:33] to start getting into Bitcoin because
[41:34] they have cash. And also because on a
[41:36] practical level, you know, they've got
[41:37] an app that allows them to move uh uh
[41:39] Tether around. they get the intuitive
[41:42] idea behind, you know, private keys,
[41:43] public keys, how you use that, and then
[41:46] it's going to be very easy for them. The
[41:47] same way that they made the upgrade from
[41:49] the Argentine peso to the dollar, then
[41:52] it's the next step from the dollar to
[41:54] Bitcoin. That's Yeah. And I I generally
[41:57] I'm not too u I'm not too negative about
[42:00] Tether because of that because
[42:02] ultimately, you know, I saw people use
[42:03] it. I I I remember in Lebanon, it was a
[42:05] lifeline for a lot of people. So it's
[42:07] it's completely callous to just say no,
[42:09] they shouldn't use it. It works. It
[42:13] Yeah. And also, I mean, this is now
[42:15] getting the technicals of the fiat
[42:16] system, but Tether doesn't own 10-year
[42:19] Treasury bonds. They buy these coupons
[42:22] that need to be refinanced every, you
[42:24] know, 3, six months. And so they're not,
[42:27] you know, the US government can't
[42:29] finance itself. Uh they're not the
[42:32] preferred lenders to the US government
[42:34] either, by the way. they're buying these
[42:36] short-term effective like bank deposits
[42:38] that are underwritten by the US
[42:40] government. And so I would say, you
[42:42] know, listen, if if the United States
[42:44] comes out and says, "Hey, new rule. If
[42:46] you're a stable coin, you need to buy
[42:48] 100year garbage bonds with all the
[42:51] customer deposits, then all of a sudden
[42:53] you're talking about, you know, stable
[42:55] coins being strongarmed into financing a
[42:58] government that's just perpetuating this
[43:00] garbage system." But the reality is
[43:02] they're servicing demand and helping
[43:04] people. They're buying these coupons.
[43:06] They're taking the profits and changing
[43:08] the world and buying Bitcoin. My
[43:10] customers are happy. The US is happy.
[43:13] Everyone's happy. I just see it as the
[43:15] private sector doing, you know, the work
[43:18] that governments and the uh co-opted
[43:22] banking system what they couldn't do
[43:23] with their fractional reserve nonsense
[43:25] and the fact that they've persisted
[43:26] their businesses through regulatory
[43:28] modes and through strong armed lobbying
[43:29] as opposed to competing in the free
[43:31] market. Like if Chase was actually good
[43:34] leadership, good technologist, they
[43:35] would have built this product 20 years
[43:36] ago. But they're not. They they spend
[43:38] their time lobbying in Washington DC.
[43:40] And so I see this as the free market and
[43:42] technologists and innovators doing good
[43:44] work for people around the world.
[43:46] They've helped hundreds of millions of
[43:47] people. I don't see a problem. Yeah. And
[43:49] also I think you know yes they're adding
[43:52] they're buying up a lot of treasuries
[43:55] but ultimately the I think the key thing
[43:58] that a lot of people are missing is that
[44:00] a lot of that is not new demand for
[44:02] treasuries. It's displacing existing
[44:04] central bank for treasury demand for
[44:06] treasuries. So people who are moving
[44:07] from the peso, the peso at the end of
[44:09] the day is just in its ideal form, it's
[44:12] a dollar stable coin. You know, the best
[44:13] thing that you could do with the peso is
[44:15] have a fixed exchange rate against the
[44:17] dollar or at least maintain uh some
[44:19] fixed rate, some close to fixed rate
[44:21] against the dollar so that the peso is
[44:22] not devaluing against the dollar. You
[44:24] can't beat the dollar, but you can at
[44:26] least hopefully, you know, many
[44:28] countries have managed to do this. I
[44:30] live in Jordan. They've been um for more
[44:32] than 35 years now, the exchange rate has
[44:34] been fixed against the dollar. That's
[44:36] basically your best case scenario. So,
[44:38] how do you do that? How can you keep
[44:39] your currency fixed against the dollar?
[44:41] You need to be buying dollars and
[44:43] treasuries and you need to be making a
[44:44] market in them. And you need to be able
[44:45] to redeem uh people's uh you know, when
[44:48] people want to dump your currency, you
[44:49] need to be able to buy it up with the
[44:51] dollars so that the currency doesn't go
[44:53] and then when there's a lot of more
[44:54] demand for your currency, you need to be
[44:56] able to sell some of it and accumulate
[44:58] dollars. So central banks hold enormous
[45:01] quantities of dollars and tether is just
[45:04] doing the same thing. Now granted they
[45:06] do it in a much more efficient way.
[45:08] That's the their secret. So Tether
[45:11] they've got a 100 employees. You know
[45:12] Paulo and his friends and cousins
[45:14] basically uh running a company that's
[45:17] making 13 billion dollars of profit a
[45:19] year. It's the most profitable company
[45:21] in human history. Um well, you know, uh
[45:25] 140 million $140 billion is this medium
[45:28] country's money supply. And now compare
[45:31] a country that runs a $140 billion
[45:34] national currency and think about how
[45:37] much more inefficient it is than Tether
[45:41] because you know it's not just they
[45:43] don't just have 100 people running that
[45:45] central bank. They are running the
[45:47] central bank. They're running the entire
[45:48] government from that currency. So when
[45:50] you hold their stable coin, their dollar
[45:53] stable coin, which is the peso or the
[45:54] lero or whatever it is, you're financing
[45:58] and the overhead of the entire
[46:00] government, the army, the
[46:02] police, the presidential palace, um all
[46:06] of the theft, all of that is being
[46:08] financed from the money printing and
[46:10] from the business. So it's an extremely
[46:12] inefficient way of converting demand for
[46:14] dollars into um a medium exchange that
[46:18] people can use day dayto day and it's a
[46:21] way that demands a lot of dollars but
[46:23] now tether is doing it in a more
[46:24] efficient way. So yeah likely it will
[46:27] increase demand for treasuries but it's
[46:28] not entirely new demand. It's not like
[46:30] those $150 billion in treasuries that
[46:32] they currently hold are um you know dis
[46:36] out of nowhere. They likely displaced a
[46:38] lot of the demand that central banks
[46:40] would have been holding.
[46:42] 100% I couldn't agree more. I love the
[46:44] point on free markets in the private
[46:46] sector. Like let entrepreneurs in the
[46:48] free market solve problems for people
[46:50] and they will come up with the most
[46:51] efficient cost-effective way. Like
[46:54] public sector governments and to me like
[46:57] JP Morgan, Bank of America, all these
[46:59] big too big to fail banks, they're
[47:01] effectively arms of the government and
[47:04] they aren't innovators. They have not
[47:06] been building progressive technology.
[47:08] They've just been lobbying. And so,
[47:09] yeah, you're seeing a massively
[47:12] innovative profit per employee business,
[47:14] highly efficient, solve a problem for
[47:16] hundreds of millions of people with like
[47:17] a 100 folks. And that's exactly how the
[47:20] world should be. That's the incentive of
[47:22] the free market and, you know, capital
[47:24] structure. So, I couldn't agree more. I
[47:27] mean, to be honest, I like one of the
[47:29] dumbest things the Democrats ever did in
[47:31] America was poo poo Mark Zuckerberg with
[47:34] his Libra token or whatever. Like, what
[47:37] idiots. I mean, that that shows you just
[47:41] how, you know, monstrous government has
[47:43] gotten over control that they couldn't
[47:45] see the forest for the trees and realize
[47:47] that letting the private sector solve
[47:49] these problems, letting the free market
[47:51] go out and build technology. Who would
[47:52] have been better at building technology
[47:54] and distributing the dollar to billions
[47:56] of people all over the world than the
[47:57] guy that has 4 billion daily active
[47:59] users? News flash, nobody. But
[48:02] government is too big and too power-
[48:03] hungry and too stupid to realize that
[48:06] they got in that guy's way and shut it
[48:08] down. But inevitably, the private sector
[48:10] and like entrepreneurs in the free
[48:12] market are going to be the be best and
[48:13] most efficient at solving these
[48:14] problems. So to me, the fact that the US
[48:16] government has come all the way around
[48:18] to realizing Tether is a good thing,
[48:20] innovation is a good thing, uh progress
[48:23] is a good thing, demand for their debt
[48:25] is a good thing for them. Um it just
[48:27] flies in the face of everything they
[48:28] claim to be. It's like you idiots. Four
[48:30] years ago, you were trying to kill this
[48:32] industry. Now you're supporting it. You
[48:33] look like clowns. And now looking back,
[48:36] the best thing you could have done is
[48:37] support Mark Zuckerberg in innovation.
[48:40] But um you guys are just too power-
[48:42] hungry and stupid. Uh couldn't get out
[48:44] of your own way. Yeah, but I mean, let's
[48:47] face it, I'd much rather have Paulo
[48:48] handling this thing than Oh, I mean, I'm
[48:52] I'm, you know, these are my co-founders
[48:54] uh on 21 and I think I mean, these guys
[48:59] are awesome innovators. They're
[49:00] Bitcoiners at the end of the day, as I
[49:02] mentioned. So, I think the universe
[49:04] doesn't make any mistakes. Let's be
[49:06] clear. uh I think they've earned through
[49:08] proof of work the position they're in
[49:10] and they've done a tremendous job
[49:12] building the business and then using
[49:13] their resources to further influence the
[49:15] world in what they think is the right
[49:16] direction. I mean Paulo's out investing
[49:18] and innovating in neuroscience. He's out
[49:21] and building self-s sovereign locally
[49:23] hosted AI to compete against Sam Alman's
[49:26] monopoly over understanding everything
[49:28] about your life. He's building P2P
[49:30] communication chat. So, I mean, I think
[49:32] these guys deserve to be in the place
[49:34] they're in, and I feel very confident
[49:36] that they're going to have ethical
[49:37] interests into what they do with the
[49:39] resources, but yeah, my point was more
[49:42] just the US making a mockery of itself,
[49:45] being so power control hungry that
[49:46] they're flip-flopping on, you know,
[49:48] whether stable coins are good or not.
[49:50] Just it's the public sector's a mess.
[49:52] the most inefficient misuse of capital
[49:56] like in human history is people with the
[49:59] money printer that elect themselves uh
[50:01] to just um pour money into stupid you
[50:04] know power controlled ways. Uh and you
[50:07] can see if you let the free market do
[50:09] its thing how efficient humans are. They
[50:11] can take a hundred people, work in a
[50:13] room with Paulo, and change the lives of
[50:16] half a billion people without while
[50:18] fighting the most powerful governments
[50:21] along their journey. That's just how
[50:23] awesome human beings are if you just get
[50:25] out of their way. Yeah, absolutely. And
[50:27] the thing is, you know, they're buying
[50:28] Bitcoin. And for me recently, I got this
[50:31] I I'm beginning to think about this that
[50:33] Tether might actually uh play an
[50:36] important role in the transition to a
[50:38] Bitcoin standard because as they keep um
[50:42] you know, if they keep growing and they
[50:45] keep selling more USDT, buying more
[50:48] treasuries, they're going to make more
[50:50] profit and they're going to put that
[50:51] into Bitcoin. Now, their Bitcoin is
[50:53] going to go up over time. Their dollar
[50:55] is going to go down over time. And then
[50:57] over time their liabilities, you know,
[51:00] are going to become a lot lower in real
[51:03] terms value compared to their balance
[51:04] sheet because their Bitcoin is going up.
[51:06] So there will come a point that think in
[51:08] which they're going to have to break the
[51:10] peg, but they're not going to break the
[51:11] peg downward. I think they're going to
[51:13] break the peg upward. I think there will
[51:15] come a point in which Apollo is going to
[51:17] say one USDT is equal to $1.02
[51:20] 02 and then maybe every year they're
[51:22] going to add another two cents to it and
[51:24] then it's just going to keep going up
[51:26] because the dollar is going to keep
[51:27] going down and then maybe if they add 2%
[51:29] per year to the USDT they make it
[51:32] redeemable for a larger quantity then
[51:35] maybe USDT becomes a better currency
[51:37] than the dollar because the USDT has a
[51:39] lot of Bitcoin backing it so they're
[51:42] able to increase the value of their
[51:44] currencies compared to the dollar and so
[51:46] then as the dollar continues to circle
[51:48] the drain the USDT can um have some kind
[51:52] of orderly alternative which increases
[51:55] over time in value and therefore as you
[51:58] know Bitcoin increases more the dollar
[52:00] drops less and less and less eventually
[52:04] you can you keep bringing up the value
[52:06] of the USDT and then you just peg the
[52:08] USDT to Bitcoin and no longer need to
[52:11] peg it to the dollar. I couldn't agree
[52:14] more. All right. I mean, listen, I think
[52:16] they're running a dollar product.
[52:20] They're running a bank the right way.
[52:21] They're they're holding the coupon, the
[52:24] short-term US debt. They're now there's
[52:26] more reserves for USDT than there is
[52:30] USDT because they've been purchasing and
[52:32] holding both gold and Bitcoin safe. So,
[52:35] these are two assets that have scarcity
[52:38] elements to it that are performing
[52:40] tremendously well. I think what's
[52:42] happening with the Trump administration
[52:43] is fascinating. I mean, he's pivoting
[52:45] away from tariffs and now he's onto this
[52:47] capital controls idea. But the point is
[52:49] basically, hey, foreigners, get your
[52:50] money out of the country. The deal was
[52:52] you have to buy treasuries, not our
[52:54] stock market, not our land, not real
[52:56] estate and bid up and cause tremendous
[52:59] amounts of asset inflation in the
[53:00] country and create a wealth gap here.
[53:02] Get your money out and effectively
[53:04] telling them buy gold, buy Bitcoin. And
[53:07] here you have a bank for 400 million
[53:10] people effectively that is over reserved
[53:13] with gold bitcoin holding short-term
[53:16] coupons. I I mean I think what te te
[53:18] tether has a tether gold product by the
[53:20] way I think is very forwardlooking like
[53:22] how long before the world wants digital
[53:25] open network version of gold that's easy
[53:28] to remit that's easy to transport that's
[53:30] e easy to settle trade like is the world
[53:32] going to use tether gold as well. And
[53:34] then to your point at at one point if
[53:37] the dollar is debased enough you know
[53:40] can they incorporate Bitcoin? Um and I
[53:45] think so. So yeah I think it's what if
[53:48] what if the world had a full reserve or
[53:50] overreserved bank that was
[53:52] technologically forward built by
[53:54] pioneers innovators. It was the private
[53:57] sector. They were incented by profits.
[53:59] They were incented to keep itself lean.
[54:00] They had a hurdle rate that was
[54:02] reasonable. like what if that existed
[54:04] and that's what we're looking at and
[54:05] contrast that against Bank of America by
[54:08] the way if you know the US tenure gets
[54:10] above 5% Bank of America is functionally
[54:12] insolvent so take compare Bank of
[54:15] America to Tether and you'll so yes I
[54:19] couldn't agree more yeah I mean this is
[54:21] when I uh changed my mind on tether and
[54:24] this is when I was comfortable publicly
[54:26] saying that u this thing actually has a
[54:28] use case uh when I saw what happened in
[54:30] 2022 when uh Everything was falling
[54:33] apart and Tether had to redeem something
[54:36] like $20 billion over a weekend or I I
[54:39] don't remember the exact numbers. I
[54:40] discussed it with Paulo. I hosted him in
[54:42] the podcast. So, check it out if you're
[54:44] interested. We talk about the details of
[54:46] the numbers. But basically, this was
[54:48] bigger than any redemption that any bank
[54:51] in the fiat system has ever had to do.
[54:53] JP Morgan has never had its customers
[54:56] come up and say, "Hey, we want to
[54:57] liquidate everything we have to you with
[54:59] you and we want to get cash out." and
[55:01] that adds up to $7 billion or anything.
[55:04] I mean, can you imagine what would
[55:05] happen if somebody went to JP Morgan or
[55:07] City Bank and said, "Hey, I want my $20
[55:09] billion." I mean, we saw what happened
[55:11] with Silicon Valley Bank, right? They're
[55:12] no longer. So, yeah. And that was a lot
[55:15] smaller, you know? Yeah. I think a 20
[55:17] bill I think what what Tether withtood
[55:19] on that day, I think would have broken
[55:22] any bank in the world. And not not just
[55:24] the bank, but I think the the entire
[55:26] banking system. I think that it it it it
[55:30] would be a mad max world if somebody
[55:32] were to go to JP Morgan or City Bank and
[55:34] tell them, "Hey, I want to get my $20
[55:35] billion out over the weekend." And yet,
[55:39] you know, 100 guys in Switzerland on
[55:42] their laptops managed to do this. It's
[55:44] absolutely astonishing and it's just
[55:46] there's no way around it. This is truly
[55:48] a very powerful innovation.
[55:51] Yeah, I couldn't agree more.
[55:53] I mean my friendship with these guys was
[55:56] before Tether even existed. So you know
[55:59] similar group created Bitfinex which is
[56:01] one of the largest exchanges in the
[56:02] world. Bitfinex is the first to
[56:04] integrate lightning. Bitfinex and tether
[56:07] now have doiciled in El Salvador where
[56:10] you know I was a material part of that
[56:12] government's journey into Bitcoin. And
[56:14] so we've overlapped over the years. Um,
[56:16] I've only gotten to know the business
[56:18] just like everyone else over Twitter and
[56:20] seeing their attestations and stuff, but
[56:22] I've known these guys for over a decade
[56:23] just because they're Bitcoiners. And so,
[56:26] you know, we also like our founding
[56:28] story for 21 and these guys are
[56:30] Bitcoiners. We were watching what Sailor
[56:31] was doing. Um, we thought we could bring
[56:33] something new and exciting to the
[56:35] marketplace um into the capital markets
[56:37] with a slightly different vehicle. But,
[56:39] um, it's remarkable what they've built
[56:42] um what they've also just I'm an
[56:43] entrepreneur as well. what they've been
[56:45] able to overcome as far as adversity. Uh
[56:49] I mean, you got to be a special type of
[56:52] person and group of people to persevere
[56:54] through what they've been up against.
[56:56] And uh turns out it's a great business.
[56:58] And um they're changing the world now in
[57:01] a plethora of ways. I do really
[57:03] encourage people to look at all the like
[57:05] money and investments. They're they're
[57:07] trying to change neuroscience. They're
[57:09] trying to change AI in a distributed
[57:11] self-s sovereign way. They're trying to
[57:14] uh change P2P communications now.
[57:17] They're bringing a vehicle to capital
[57:19] markets with me in the US. I don't know.
[57:22] It's a cool story. Uh and they're good.
[57:24] They're good Bitcoiners. Yeah, they're
[57:26] stack and sats ultimately. Although I
[57:28] mean it's not it's it's not all great.
[57:30] They are investing in Juventus football
[57:32] club which I think is inexcusable but
[57:34] Oh, I don't know much about that. Okay.
[57:37] Okay. All right. So now tell us about
[57:40] 21. What's going on there?
[57:42] Uh so 21 we want to give the capital US
[57:46] capital markets a unique type of vehicle
[57:48] what we consider unique um carrying the
[57:51] the story forward. So, I've known the
[57:53] Tether guys forever and it's been, you
[57:56] know, the analogous campfire, the
[57:58] conversation all Bitcoiners have like,
[57:59] "Wow, you see what Sailor's doing. You
[58:01] see what this gu is doing." And four or
[58:03] five years ago, we couldn't believe what
[58:04] Michael was pulling off listening to
[58:05] probably your podcast with him. And I
[58:08] think Bitcoin has always inspired the
[58:09] most creative thinking I've ever seen.
[58:12] It's just such a free market. There's no
[58:14] interference or intermediaries that get
[58:15] in the way of people coming up with
[58:17] clever ideas and testing the
[58:19] marketplace. So we were just cheering
[58:21] Sailor on as Bitcoiners. I would
[58:24] say you know that was four or five years
[58:26] ago maybe one to two years ago we'd seen
[58:28] the industry evolve and some smaller cap
[58:31] companies had copied sailor there had
[58:33] been a lot more institutional demand for
[58:35] Bitcoin a lot more you know bigger
[58:37] appetite in the capital markets and we
[58:40] thought you know a lot of the smaller
[58:43] businesses that had pivoted to Bitcoin
[58:45] um these are businesses sailor always
[58:47] talks about businesses that needed
[58:49] Bitcoin Bitcoin's on a need to know
[58:51] basis like maybe their old business was
[58:52] failing, maybe they need a new life,
[58:54] maybe they need a new growth, and
[58:56] they're pivoting to Bitcoin and and a
[58:58] smaller cap capacity. And uh on the
[59:01] Michael Sailor Micro Strategy side, you
[59:03] know, we think there's an opportunity to
[59:05] build technology with a balance sheet
[59:07] that big and with access to capital
[59:09] markets like Paulo and I, we've built
[59:11] really high margin, high-profit, high
[59:14] growth technology in this sector at
[59:16] Strike at Tether. And so it was this
[59:18] combination of we wanted to bring both
[59:22] bluechip credibility and startup upside.
[59:24] We wanted to bring a vehicle that was
[59:26] big enough to win, small enough to grow.
[59:28] So we're not coming to the market with
[59:29] hundreds of millions of dollars. We're
[59:30] coming with billions of dollars
[59:32] initially. We're already the third
[59:33] largest treasury in the world. So we can
[59:36] fill that institutional demand so to
[59:39] speak like we we can like an investor
[59:41] like SoftBank gave us a billion dollar
[59:43] check you know we we can take on that
[59:45] level of demand no problem. But we
[59:48] wanted to bring the startup upside. We
[59:49] think that there's room to build
[59:50] technology that we don't need to be a
[59:53] hotel or or you know some pivoting
[59:54] business. Not that there's anything
[59:56] wrong with that by the way clearly. I
[59:57] mean MetaPlanet is killing it. But we
[60:00] didn't want to be a business that was
[60:01] pivoting from something in the past.
[60:02] We're purposebuilt and founded to be a
[60:04] Bitcoin company. We're going to build
[60:06] Bitcoin technology and we're going to
[60:07] use the capital markets in our balance
[60:09] sheet to acquire as much Bitcoin as
[60:10] possible. And we thought that that was
[60:12] something that the capital markets
[60:13] hadn't had yet. and watching the story
[60:16] evolve. We were waiting for someone to
[60:18] do it and at one point sitting around
[60:19] the campfire, we looked at each other
[60:21] and we're like, who better to do it than
[60:22] us? Both Strike and Tether are, you
[60:24] know, as successful for gross and net
[60:26] profit per employee as there is in
[60:28] Bitcoin. We know how to do these things.
[60:30] We have lots of capital. Tether has lots
[60:32] of money as we just talked about and um
[60:34] we might as well be the change we wanted
[60:35] to see. So, that's the founding story
[60:37] and yeah, there's lots of fun stuff to
[60:40] talk about,
[60:42] but yeah. Um so I mean uh do you see any
[60:47] kind of differentiation between what you
[60:48] guys are doing and what Sailor is doing?
[60:51] Uh yeah I think I think the main
[60:54] differentiation is that we want to build
[60:56] Bitcoin financial services. So we think
[60:58] there's opportunities the lending market
[61:00] and the credit market. We've filed this
[61:03] all with the SEC already. We think we
[61:05] can generate cash flow and a lot of our
[61:08] actual operating company will be focused
[61:10] on Bitcoin. There's ways to le leverage
[61:13] Tether and their network. There's ways
[61:14] to leverage stuff I've done with Strike.
[61:17] Uh we think to actually build cash flow
[61:20] and a business that's going to be
[61:22] growing and uh stacking SATs with uh
[61:25] cash profit. I think that's probably the
[61:27] biggest differentiator. I think um
[61:30] Sailor uh hasn't embarked on building
[61:32] Bitcoin software yet. I don't know if he
[61:34] plans to. I'm sure he will at some
[61:36] point, but for us that's probably the
[61:38] biggest one. Um, we have similar KPIs
[61:41] like we measure Bitcoin per share, coin
[61:43] return rate. So, we don't want to be
[61:45] measured in fiat similar to Sailor. He's
[61:47] got BTC yield, but I would say yeah, for
[61:50] Sailor, he's plenty big for
[61:52] institutions, right? I mean, it's a
[61:53] hundred billion dollar company at this
[61:55] point. Um, but we hadn't seen him extend
[61:58] that opportunity to build software and
[62:01] build products. Um, we think there's
[62:03] going to be I mean, if Bitcoin is going
[62:04] to be a $2 trillion asset going on 20
[62:06] trillion, going on 200 trillion, people
[62:08] are going to need financial services at
[62:10] a severe scale. Um, I don't think
[62:12] Coinbase is going to be able to do that.
[62:14] And I don't know if Micro Strategy is
[62:16] interested in doing that. We are at 21.
[62:18] Paulo and I absolutely are. And then for
[62:22] the other Bitcoin Treasury companies,
[62:24] not that there's anything wrong with
[62:25] them, but they're just a little bit
[62:26] smaller. So, you're talking about market
[62:27] caps of, you know, a couple hundred
[62:29] million bucks. and someone like a soft
[62:31] bank can't call them and say, "I want a
[62:32] billion dollars worth of exposure. I got
[62:34] real size capital." Um, you know, the
[62:36] fixed income market's in trouble. The
[62:38] 60/40 portfolio is dead. Bonds are a
[62:41] shitcoin. And there's a lot of money on
[62:43] Wall Street that I've been meeting with
[62:45] that need a new home. And we needed a a
[62:48] company that could actually soak up that
[62:50] size of demand. And so that's why I say
[62:53] big enough to win, small enough to grow,
[62:55] blue chip credibility, startup upside.
[62:57] that's kind of how we see ourselves um
[62:59] relative to everyone else. But at the
[63:00] end of the day, we're all on the same
[63:01] team. You know, I think sometimes people
[63:04] clip my my podcast and and try and put
[63:07] me up against Sailor or up against other
[63:09] Bitcoiners, and I don't view it that way
[63:12] at all. Um we're all on the same team,
[63:14] but I do think we're unique uh in those
[63:16] ways. Yeah. And I think this is really
[63:19] the beauty of it because in a sense
[63:21] there's no real competition here because
[63:24] uh the more you buy Bitcoin, the more
[63:26] you pump sailor's bags and the more he
[63:28] buys Bitcoin, the more you pump your
[63:30] bags. So the more people find new
[63:32] opportunities of doing these uh Bitcoin
[63:35] buying companies across capital markets
[63:38] with ability to access different capital
[63:40] markets, it's good for everybody
[63:42] involved. It's good for Bitcoiners and
[63:43] it's good for Bitcoin companies. So, you
[63:45] know, there's just um ju just the other
[63:48] day, you know, I was at a I was speaking
[63:49] at an insurance industry conference in
[63:51] Thailand. I was invited there and I, you
[63:53] know, the audience almost entirely no
[63:55] coiners. Nobody knows anything about
[63:56] Bitcoin. But there was this one money
[63:58] manager guy who was sitting there and he
[64:00] just um he was another speaker and he
[64:02] told me, "Yeah, that's very interesting.
[64:04] Thanks for letting me for talking about
[64:06] Bitcoin. I'm going to look into it." He
[64:08] told me, you know, I'm curious. I've
[64:09] been curious about Bitcoin for a while,
[64:10] but I didn't didn't have the time to get
[64:12] into it and study it and figure out
[64:13] what's actually going on. But then I
[64:15] heard about this stock that allows you
[64:17] to do a Bitcoin play. So, I put some
[64:20] money into this company called Micro
[64:22] Strategy and I made $1.2 million just by
[64:24] buying Micro Strategy. And the guy still
[64:26] has no idea what Bitcoin is. But this is
[64:29] really how it works in fiat market. I
[64:31] mean, the way to be in fiat market is to
[64:33] just constantly everybody's always
[64:35] moving money around and it doesn't take
[64:37] them much. they, you know, your friend
[64:40] tells you about this great steel melting
[64:44] steel factory in Spain or whatever. And
[64:46] so, yeah, you just pick up your phone
[64:48] and you buy a bunch of stocks. Somebody
[64:51] tells you about a new Australian mining
[64:53] company, you go and you just buy some
[64:54] stock. You read an article in the
[64:56] newspaper that talks about some new
[64:58] industry coming along, so you just buy a
[64:59] stock. And so it doesn't take much to
[65:01] get people to become curious about
[65:03] Bitcoin, but um there the the bulk of
[65:07] the world's money is on these stock
[65:08] trading platforms. And so everywhere
[65:11] where you can show up in somebody's app
[65:13] with a with a Bitcoin product is going
[65:16] to just get a lot of money. And then
[65:18] it's just the mimemetic power. Like this
[65:20] guy obviously is a lot more likely to
[65:22] read about Bitcoin now that he's made
[65:24] 1.2 two million thanks to Bitcoin. Then
[65:26] if he had not had that option and he
[65:28] he'd spent all this time still trying to
[65:30] figure out where to go and how to read
[65:32] and um which shitcoin exchange to use
[65:35] and so on. So, it's just it's I think
[65:38] it's an enormous opportunity and I think
[65:40] you need you're probably going to see u
[65:43] Metanet and Micro Strategy and one of
[65:46] these is going to show up in basically
[65:48] most of the large capital markets and um
[65:51] you know there's there are eyeballs on
[65:53] each capital market on all of the
[65:55] tickers on each capital market and there
[65:56] are people who have to invest in them.
[65:58] There are companies and retirement
[65:59] accounts that have to invest in
[66:00] particular capital markets. And so
[66:03] wherever the money is, you pop up one of
[66:05] these companies, it's going to do great.
[66:07] It's going to show up and you know, it's
[66:09] going to print green candles and that's
[66:11] what people want. The people want green
[66:12] candles and y that that's what these
[66:15] companies can offer. Yeah. I think there
[66:17] a few things. One, you know, I've always
[66:19] thought of Bitcoin as universal acid.
[66:21] Anything it touches, it conquers. Um you
[66:23] can't stop it. And so for the people
[66:25] that always say, why are you so focused
[66:27] on the price? Why aren't you focused on
[66:29] the technology? It's like, well, the
[66:30] price is the most important KPI we have
[66:33] and it's our biggest marketing tool. And
[66:35] the fact that the price of both Bitcoin
[66:38] meme stocks and the price of the spot
[66:40] physical asset just continues to go up
[66:43] and conquer everything it touches. That
[66:46] is the best way to spread the message.
[66:48] To be clear, there is no like silver
[66:50] bullet podcaster. At the end of the day,
[66:52] people are going to be attracted to
[66:54] giant green candles um because that's
[66:56] what we all want in life is, you know,
[66:58] financial stability and in a way to
[66:59] afford uh the life that we think is
[67:01] reasonable. So that's for one. For two,
[67:04] yeah, I think I agree with you. I think
[67:05] in the US there's a very unique story
[67:08] unfolding that uh I'm fascinated by and
[67:12] one of the reasons we felt uh we should
[67:14] really go out and be the change we
[67:16] wanted to see in and found 21 is just
[67:19] what's happening in the United States
[67:21] you know for the listeners you know my
[67:23] the way I think about it is we're
[67:25] unwinding from the world wars call it
[67:27] after World War II a lot of the monetary
[67:30] regime setup and arrangements was very
[67:33] simple is that the US was strong say,
[67:35] you know, if you could claim a winner of
[67:37] the World Wars, it was, in my opinion,
[67:39] everyone lost. But if you could say that
[67:42] someone won, it was the United States.
[67:43] They had the most gold at the time, the
[67:45] strongest economy at the time, the
[67:46] strongest manufacturing base at the
[67:47] time. And their claim was they were
[67:50] going to export their strength to help
[67:52] everyone else out get back on their feet
[67:54] through the dollar by taking on the role
[67:55] of the World Reserve currency. And so
[67:57] the arrangement was very simple through
[67:59] all of these Brett and Woods agreements
[68:00] and such is we're going to export the
[68:03] dollar and import goods and services
[68:05] from you guys. So you guys get to use
[68:08] our strength of our economy and the fact
[68:09] that our consumers are consuming so much
[68:11] by giving us food uh raw materials. You
[68:15] know, Russia's the greatest natural
[68:17] resource producer in the world. China's
[68:18] now the world's factory and
[68:20] manufacturing base. Uh Germany makes
[68:22] really cool cars. Japan saw some of the
[68:24] biggest domestic growth of all time. and
[68:26] you're going to export to American
[68:28] consumers, we're going to export the
[68:29] dollar. So, at the time, the dollar was
[68:31] backed by gold. Then all of a sudden,
[68:33] you sever the relationship with gold.
[68:35] And the dollar was backed by kind of
[68:38] oil. At the time, we had an arrangement
[68:39] with the Middle East and a relationship
[68:42] there. Then that relationship fell
[68:44] apart. And then the dollar became backed
[68:45] by US treasuries. But then after 2008,
[68:49] China stopped buying those because
[68:51] politicians and the central bank
[68:52] prioritized Wall Street over their
[68:54] foreign trading partners. And then the
[68:56] dollar became backed by de facto the US
[68:58] stock market. And that's kind of where
[69:00] we've been today. And what's unraveling
[69:01] now is that China operates in a trillion
[69:05] dollar trade surplus right now against
[69:07] the US deficits. And they need something
[69:11] to do with the dollars that they're
[69:12] getting. They can't reinvest them
[69:14] locally in their economy because that
[69:15] would strengthen their currency and
[69:17] weaken their export business. So they
[69:19] have to put the dollars somewhere. They
[69:20] don't want to put them in treasuries
[69:22] because those are real rates negative.
[69:24] those are losing purchasing power and so
[69:26] they've been dumping them into Facebook
[69:28] stock, into Amazon stock, into Nvidia
[69:30] stock and that's where you get these
[69:31] companies that are trading at 50 times
[69:33] earnings. This irrational economic
[69:35] behavior because all of the global trade
[69:37] surplus is being dumped into the US
[69:38] stock market. And now the United States
[69:41] and Donald Trump are saying get your
[69:43] money out of our stock market. It's
[69:44] creating the most massive wealth gap in
[69:46] America for those that don't have a
[69:48] college education. and they don't
[69:49] benefit from this perpetual like market
[69:52] stocks go up phenomena that exists now
[69:54] in the US. And so you have an
[69:56] increasingly poor population in the
[69:58] middle of America. Those that live on
[69:59] the coast and have access to stocks are
[70:02] now getting ungodly rich without doing
[70:04] anything. And it's eroding the very like
[70:06] culture and of America. We have no
[70:09] manufacturing base. We have no middle
[70:10] class. And these American first trade
[70:12] policies that he's coming out with are
[70:14] saying get your money out. And this is
[70:16] where I think this is a fascinating time
[70:19] to give the capital markets access to
[70:21] Bitcoin um through the ways that we are
[70:23] at 21, which is the stock market is
[70:25] highly inflated because it's taking all
[70:28] of the trade surplus with foreign
[70:30] partners. And this is the dollar
[70:32] instrument that's been deacto backing
[70:34] the dollar for decades now is just plow
[70:36] it into the NASDAQ. Who cares about the
[70:38] price? Sure, Google's worth 50 times
[70:40] earnings. That's such irrational
[70:42] behavior. That's ridiculous. And so now
[70:44] I think that's all unfolding and capital
[70:46] has to find a new home. I think it's
[70:47] going to find it into Bitcoin
[70:48] eventually. Gold for now for certain if
[70:51] you just pull up a chart. Uh but just
[70:53] giving these capital markets access to
[70:55] rotate out of highly inflated tech
[70:58] stocks and highly inflated basket of
[71:00] indexes and into a business that's
[71:02] acquiring a hard money that has a
[71:05] tremendously powerful balance sheet
[71:06] that's able to give you fixed income
[71:08] instruments like a Bitcoinbacked bond.
[71:11] Um we think there's huge opportunity
[71:13] there and there's a massive massive
[71:15] amount of capital that needs to rotate
[71:17] out of you know a carry trade that's
[71:20] over and that's unwinding and you know
[71:21] this is a process that's been building
[71:23] up for 100 years since the world wars is
[71:26] you know what's de facto backing this
[71:28] printed piece of paper that the US is
[71:30] exporting and these deficits that have
[71:32] compounded on each other for so long um
[71:35] and giving people an escape hatch.
[71:38] Yeah, I think I I I I probably slightly
[71:41] disagree in that. I don't think it's the
[71:42] fact that people are bringing in the
[71:44] money that's causing the bubble. I think
[71:46] it's just the fact that the central bank
[71:48] is printing the money, but you know,
[71:51] that's kind of uh splitting hairs here.
[71:53] Um it's it's it's still ultimately both
[71:56] are true. Yeah. And it's still a massive
[71:58] massive imbalance which is caused by the
[72:00] fact that everybody else in the world
[72:02] has to work for the dollar, but the US
[72:03] government can print it. But the but the
[72:06] um you know I think the um the crazy
[72:09] thing about what Trump is doing is that
[72:10] essentially he's trying to remove the uh
[72:14] symptoms of the problem of the money
[72:16] printer while keeping the money printer.
[72:17] And that's I think what's uh what's what
[72:20] what's making
[72:21] it so far seems to be on um uh
[72:25] backfiring. In fact, as we speak,
[72:27] there's been a big spike in the 10-year
[72:29] yield. It's up to almost 4.6 now, which
[72:32] is a huge uh deal. Uh I think I don't
[72:35] this might be the highest it's been in a
[72:37] very long time. Um you know the this is
[72:40] this is I think the important one. The
[72:42] bonds are getting destroyed. So as the
[72:44] bond yield rises the value of existing
[72:46] bond drops and that's dangerous because
[72:49] it's it's um it's that's the cost of the
[72:52] US government borrowing and US
[72:54] government has a lot of debt to roll
[72:56] over now.
[72:57] Yeah. I mean I couldn't agree more. I
[73:00] think Trump came out with this
[73:01] maximalist tariffs position and it
[73:03] backfired on him. Um, and now he's
[73:07] pivoting to capital controls which is
[73:10] effectively trying to achieve the same
[73:11] thing. I mean, what we have to
[73:12] understand is the US has been running
[73:15] this massive trade deficit meaning the
[73:17] the rest of the world is getting a ton
[73:19] of dollars and they have to do something
[73:21] with the dollars. They don't want to buy
[73:22] their own currency with the dollars. So,
[73:25] traditionally it was buy gold because we
[73:27] were living on a gold standard. Then it
[73:28] was buy US treasuries because those were
[73:30] de facto backing. And now it's buy
[73:32] stocks, buy land, buy farmland in the
[73:34] US, buy real estate in the US. And
[73:36] you're seeing these foreign trading
[73:38] partners just scoop up all of the
[73:40] desirable goods in America. And that's
[73:42] caused civil unrest in America because
[73:45] now there's like 80 90% of America that
[73:47] can't afford the yacht, can't afford the
[73:48] penthouse, can't afford all the things
[73:50] that these foreigners are bidding up in
[73:52] price because they have such a surplus
[73:53] of dollars that the central bank has
[73:55] printed. And it's really divided the
[73:58] country. Like when you talk about
[73:59] America, you're talking about two
[74:00] Americas. Now, which America are you
[74:02] talking about? Are you talking about the
[74:03] rust belt America, middle America? Over
[74:05] half the country doesn't have a college
[74:07] education. Or are you talking about
[74:09] Silicon Valley America? Are you talking
[74:10] about Manhattan America? They're two
[74:11] separate Americas at this point. And so
[74:14] Trump has been saying, I'm working for
[74:16] Main Street, not Wall Street. I'm
[74:18] talking about bringing back the
[74:19] manufacturing jobs. I'm talking about
[74:20] bringing back the middle class. And so
[74:22] what he's trying to do is get the
[74:24] foreign capital out of America, which is
[74:28]  That's a bad deal. You cannot
[74:30] give China a trillion dollars of US
[74:32] dollars and offer them nothing to buy
[74:33] with it. It's a raw deal. And so I mean,
[74:37] what I think is happening is, you know,
[74:39] Trump came out with his tariffs and the
[74:40] one thing he didn't tariff is gold. You
[74:43] know, it's to me it's an effective wink
[74:45] wink nod nod. We're going to start a
[74:46] Bitcoin strategic reserve and we're not
[74:48] going to tariff gold. Everything else
[74:50] you're not allowed to buy. I'm going to
[74:52] impose a 30% withholding tax on stocks
[74:55] and land and real estate you buy in
[74:57] America and the 10-year Treasury is
[74:59] going to run real rates negative. So,
[75:00] you buy the Treasury, you lose
[75:02] purchasing power. You buy any of the
[75:03] stuff in this country, I'm going to tax
[75:05] the living hell out of you, but you can
[75:06] buy gold and I encourage you to buy
[75:08] Bitcoin. And then to see like the Abu
[75:10] Dhabi sovereign wealth fund come out and
[75:11] say, "Yeah, we we just added half a
[75:14] billion dollars to our Bitcoin
[75:15] position." I think we're moving back to
[75:17] neutral reserve currency. I think
[75:19] eventually the Trump administration is
[75:21] going to revalue the gold on the balance
[75:24] sheet of the government and they're
[75:26] going to put more of a focus on Bitcoin
[75:29] and the dollar. You know, the dollar
[75:31] will be the world reserve currency,
[75:33] whatever that means. Yes, your pizza
[75:34] will be priced in dollars, but the world
[75:37] reserve asset where sovereigns and
[75:39] central banks and businesses actually
[75:41] store their cash balances, I think will
[75:43] be increasingly gold and Bitcoin and
[75:45] eventually Bitcoin in my opinion.
[75:47] I I I just find it hard to believe that
[75:50] um they've got a hard money uh instinct.
[75:53] I just I mean you listen to Lutnik, you
[75:56] listen to Bent. I mean they're very big
[75:58] fan and Trump as well. You know they're
[75:59] very big fans of the US dollar being the
[76:01] global reserve currency. They want to
[76:03] strengthen it. They want to u make sure
[76:05] the whole world uses it. Trump was
[76:07] saying something about sanctions against
[76:08] countries that try and move away from
[76:10] the dollar. And you know, you look at
[76:12] the budget that is uh being uh bandied
[76:16] about now. It's basically Biden
[76:19] economics uh but with added defense
[76:22] spending. It's uh it's keeping all of
[76:24] the Green New Deal stuff. It's keeping
[76:26] all of the um I mean uh it's it's really
[76:30] business as usual. Nothing has changed.
[76:31] All of the talk about reducing
[76:33] government spending. So if you do move
[76:36] to you tie the dollar to gold or
[76:40] bitcoin, if you do increase the value of
[76:42] gold or bitcoin,
[76:44] uh I mean you have two scenarios there.
[76:46] You're either going to undermine the
[76:47] dollar massively because you're going to
[76:49] increase the demand for go for gold and
[76:52] bitcoin or you're going to have to peg
[76:54] the dollar to gold or bitcoin at which
[76:57] point no more senior at which point you
[76:59] need to run a balanced budget in the
[77:00] long run.
[77:02] And that's just doesn't seem very likely
[77:05] to me. Yeah, I don't think that's
[77:07] happening anytime soon. And to be clear,
[77:09] as an American, this is a bipartisan
[77:11] effort. Like the notion that this is a
[77:13] Republican thing or a Trump thing is
[77:14] garbage. That's just different rhetoric
[77:16] and different gobblygook that's trying
[77:17] to achieve the same thing, which is I
[77:19] mean, even the reliance on China is a
[77:21] national security threat at this point.
[77:23] At least you can make the claim over 78%
[77:26] I think is the number of the materials
[77:28] needed to produce weapons. We need China
[77:31] to play ball with us. So we've
[77:34] outsourced the ability to produce
[77:36] anything to such a degree that there has
[77:39] to be a chai chai America divorce,
[77:42] whatever that means to you. And that's
[77:43] bipartisan in the United States. And I
[77:46] think the way that you know hearing
[77:48] these politicians, the the funniest
[77:50] thing about politicians is they have to
[77:51] get reelected. And so, for
[77:54] example, Treasury Secretary Scott
[77:56] Bessant is having a tough time finding
[77:58] buyers for his garbage 10-year bonds,
[78:01] right? No one wants that heaping pile of
[78:03] crap. And so, they need better
[78:05] influencers really. Yeah, exactly. Well,
[78:08] who's who's been the marginal buyer? Cuz
[78:11] it's not China, right? They don't want
[78:13] that crap either. It's been if you look
[78:16] at it's been Paulo. But if Paul So what
[78:19] I found fascinating, Paulo tweeted out a
[78:21] graphic where he's now top five, you
[78:23] know, purchasers of US debt. And I was
[78:26] like, really top five? Who's number one?
[78:27] Number one's the Cayman Islands. The
[78:28] Cayman Islands has 75,000 people. How
[78:31] are the Cayman Islands? Oh, that's where
[78:33] all the hedge funds are. And so what you
[78:35] realize is an extremely levered US
[78:38] banking system, an extremely levered
[78:40] Wall Street of of hedge funds are
[78:43] replacing the buying power of China. the
[78:45] only way they can replace that level of
[78:46] buying power is with leverage. And so
[78:49] when Scott Besson comes out and says,
[78:51] "We're focused on deregulation,"
[78:53] deregulation is a fancy way of saying,
[78:55] "We're going to remove the supplemental
[78:57] leverage ratio and allow banks and hedge
[78:59] funds to use unlimited leverage to buy
[79:02] the 10-year." Now, if I were to say it
[79:04] like that, it doesn't sound very
[79:05] politically palatable, right? Like
[79:07] unlimited leverage for Wall Street is a
[79:10] bad word. That's how you don't get
[79:11] reelected. But if I say this is about
[79:13] deregulation and getting out of the way
[79:15] of innovation, that's why I'm going to
[79:16] remove the rules that force banks to
[79:18] post collateral to buy my garbage bonds,
[79:21] then all of a sudden it sounds
[79:23] appealing. Another goal for Bessant, he
[79:25] needs to devalue the dollar against the
[79:27] wan. He needs the Chinese currency to
[79:30] get stronger. He needs the dollar to get
[79:31] weaker. But instead of saying we need a
[79:34] weaker dollar, he says we've been
[79:36] talking to China about finding a more
[79:38] fair equilibrium. Well, an equilibrium
[79:41] would if these things are going to be
[79:42] more equal, it means the dollar's got to
[79:44] come down and the wand's got to come up.
[79:45] But that's a more politically palatable
[79:47] way of saying I have to devalue the
[79:49] dollar. I don't have a choice. So these
[79:51] politicians, you know, warping their
[79:54] words to make them sound better than
[79:55] they are to get reelected. I do think
[79:58] inevitably it's a bipartisan effort to
[80:02] uh reduce like we have to exit this
[80:04] deficit world. It's it's becoming a
[80:06] national security threat now. whether
[80:08] they forfeit the money printer now or in
[80:10] the future. We all know it's inevitably
[80:11] coming, but I see a lot more gradual
[80:15] process towards gold and Bitcoin than
[80:18] I've ever seen of any administration.
[80:20] And uh they're trying to mask it. Like,
[80:22] you know, even you know, QE is a bad
[80:24] word now. Every even even the normal
[80:26] American at the grocery store knows QE
[80:28] means inflation. Inflation is bad. And
[80:31] so, you know, Bessant is finding ways to
[80:33] stimulate dollar liquidity through
[80:35] Treasury buybacks instead of using words
[80:37] like QE. So, at the end of the day, it's
[80:40] all garbage. They're saying the same
[80:41] thing. They're going to have to do the
[80:42] same thing. They're going to have to
[80:43] increase the money supply. They're going
[80:44] to have to print capital. They're going
[80:45] to have to value the dollar. And they're
[80:46] just doing it in clever ways that the
[80:48] person at the grocery store doesn't
[80:50] recognize. But I did find it
[80:52] fascinating. The one thing Trump didn't
[80:53] tariff was gold. And amidst all this
[80:56] reordering of global capital flows, he
[80:58] made a particular point to say we have a
[81:00] Bitcoin strategic reserve. Now whether
[81:02] that was purposeful or not, but
[81:04] foreigners and sovereign wealth funds
[81:06] like in Abu Dhabi, they're clearly
[81:07] taking note. They're buying gold.
[81:08] They're buying Bitcoin. They're not
[81:10] buying, you know, I think the NASDAQ and
[81:12] Bitcoin will decouple because sovereign
[81:14] wealth funds are going to stop buying
[81:16] Google at 50 times earnings. Why would
[81:18] they anymore? They're going to get a 30%
[81:19] withholding tax. Trump's told them
[81:21] they'll leave.
[81:23] Yeah. I I I don't think that's uh that's
[81:26] going to be very wise. I mean, I just
[81:28] think listen, the uh the the smart way
[81:31] to go about this is free trade, free
[81:33] capital flows, and get rid of the money
[81:35] printer. Now, trying to balance the
[81:38] trade while keeping the money printer is
[81:40] the equivalent of imagine you have a
[81:42] money printer in your basement and
[81:45] you're you can just print money and buy
[81:47] things for free, but you're trying to
[81:49] also make sure that you never spend more
[81:51] than you earn. They're contradicted. The
[81:53] money printer. Yeah. Why would you want
[81:55] It's not a real goal. Just get your
[81:57] money printer. Um but if you do have the
[82:00] money printer and you want to take
[82:02] advantage of it, then why are you trying
[82:04] to stop trading with people? It's like
[82:05] saying, "Yeah, buying stuff with my
[82:07] money printer." And and and Bessant has
[82:10] said this like, you know, the funniest
[82:12] thing about these people is financial
[82:14] authorities tell you what to expect
[82:16] because they cannot surprise the
[82:18] financial market. The financial market
[82:20] has way too much leverage. leverage and
[82:21] volatility don't go well. So the way
[82:23] they one of the ways they reduce
[82:24] volatility is by telling you what's
[82:26] going to happen. That's when Jerome
[82:27] Powell comes out at his little meetings
[82:29] and says, "I'm going to stop QT and
[82:32] start QE. Do you hear me?" And the
[82:34] financial markets start pricing in what
[82:36] he's saying because they can't afford
[82:38] volatility. There's too much leverage in
[82:40] the system. And so what Bessant has said
[82:42] is my goal is to reduce the deficit.
[82:45] It's not to erase it. And so you just
[82:47] listen to the guy. They're still going
[82:49] to print money. they're still going to
[82:51] have to finance this government through
[82:53] borrowing from whatever highly levered
[82:56] US bank deposits and hedge funds in the
[82:58] Cayman Islands. So, I I agree with you
[83:02] saying that we're going to balance the
[83:04] the budget but also print money. Um,
[83:06] these are contradictory statements. It
[83:08] don't make any sense. Um, we we'll see
[83:10] what happens. But just the notion that
[83:12] they're telling foreign capital to get
[83:15] out of the country, we're okay with you
[83:17] buying gold and Bitcoin, but not
[83:18] anything else. You know, I I I think
[83:21] there's a re hopefully I mean, and I'm
[83:23] I'm biased, right? I'm a Bitcoiner, so
[83:25] I'm optimistic here, but I I'm hopeful
[83:27] that there's a, you know, a restoration
[83:29] back to let's just store our capital in
[83:32] something that is scarce and see where
[83:35] things unfold from here. I think that
[83:37] that'll be the winners of this decade is
[83:39] I'm going to sit this one out. not going
[83:40] to own bonds. I'm not going to pay 50
[83:42] times earnings for a tech company where
[83:44] I don't even understand their products.
[83:46] I'm just going to stack sats and and
[83:48] watch this unfold. And and those are
[83:49] going to be the biggest winners both at
[83:51] the sovereign level and the individual
[83:52] level in my opinion. Yeah, absolutely.
[83:55] This is what I u this is what I really
[83:57] think. I mean, it's just the the most
[83:59] difficult thing about this is just
[84:00] believing that it can actually be this
[84:02] simple. It's just very difficult. It's
[84:05] very difficult particularly in fiat
[84:06] world because everybody has spent the
[84:08] last 30 40 years of their lives playing
[84:12] increasingly more complicated and
[84:13] sophisticated games trying to ek out one
[84:16] or two% over inflation and now you're
[84:19] just telling them nope don't do
[84:20] anything. You know it's a very very very
[84:23] zen thing where you just sit there and
[84:25] do nothing and watch your orange coins
[84:27] go up. Yeah. It's and it's a difficult
[84:30] thing. Um it flies in the face of
[84:32] everything you've learned. So, you know,
[84:34] Bitcoiners talk almost like it's a
[84:36] spiritual experience almost for some
[84:38] people to really educate themselves on
[84:40] the proper way to exist and live and
[84:43] provide. Um, yeah, that's the stay
[84:45] humble and stack sats is a is, you know,
[84:47] goes very deep and, uh, earn more than
[84:50] you spend. Uh, think about the future,
[84:53] lower your time preference, save. And I
[84:56] think like, you know, you got me into
[84:58] carnivore and steak and health. um I owe
[85:01] that to you. But just I don't think it's
[85:04] a mistake that Bitcoiners also then tend
[85:06] to take care of themselves. That's
[85:08] another thing with the US government I
[85:10] thought is fascinating is they're trying
[85:11] to reduce their expenses everywhere. One
[85:14] of which is Trump's now directly
[85:16] attacking the pharmaceutical industry.
[85:18] This is the first administration in
[85:20] America that's saying you're charging
[85:22] Americans 10 times as much and I don't
[85:24] care how much you're going to lobby me.
[85:25] I have to fix this because everyone in
[85:27] this country is fat and sick and it's
[85:29] too expensive for me to take care of
[85:31] everybody here. And so like I've never
[85:34] seen our government do that. And it's
[85:36] just, you know, like a restoration back
[85:39] to first principles. Instead of printing
[85:41] money to take care of fat and sick
[85:42] people, how about everyone just not be
[85:44] fat and sick? and and Bitcoiners have
[85:47] somehow figured that out first through
[85:50] the journey of low time preference,
[85:52] prioritizing their future, hard money,
[85:54] ethical living. Um, so yeah, it's
[85:58] interesting time for sure. It is. It
[86:00] absolutely is. I mean, I can I'm I'm a
[86:03] lot more cynical of the u chances of
[86:06] success for these uh ideas, but it is
[86:08] still very interesting that at least
[86:10] they're making that effort to get out
[86:11] there. Um, you know, they're going after
[86:13] the pharmaceutical companies. They may
[86:15] not have the best kind of execution on
[86:17] these ideas, but it's definitely moving
[86:20] moving the Overton window of what can
[86:23] and should be done on these things.
[86:25] Yeah, I just find it validating. I don't
[86:27] like everyone should know I've never
[86:29] voted in my life because I just don't
[86:31] believe in this system. I don't think
[86:32] change is affected by putting the right
[86:35] old white man in a blue suit in a house
[86:37] in Washington DC. That's not my belief
[86:40] system. So, I vote with my time and
[86:42] energy and that's working on Bitcoin.
[86:44] And that's where I think I can affect
[86:45] the most change. So I don't believe in
[86:47] any politician. I don't think any of
[86:49] them are going to affect more change
[86:51] than open source software and free
[86:52] markets to be clear. But I find it
[86:54] validating that all of a sudden the US
[86:56] is like wait these trade deficits don't
[86:58] make any sense. Wait, you know,
[87:01] subsidizing pharmaceutical companies
[87:03] with profits by overcharging Americans
[87:06] is actually a bad thing because we're
[87:08] enabling everyone to be fat and sick and
[87:10] that's far more costly than it is that
[87:12] you like. I just find it validating to
[87:14] hear these people say what Bitcoiners
[87:17] have believed for a very long time. So,
[87:19] we'll see where things shake out. At the
[87:21] end of the day, their jobs are to get
[87:22] reelected and, you know, pe people are
[87:25] going to vote in what they want. That's
[87:27] cheap money. Um, you know, and and so
[87:30] we'll see what happens. But it's been
[87:33] validating to to watch uh you know gold
[87:37] and Bitcoin harder assets outperform and
[87:40] uh watch Trump's tariffs fall flat on
[87:42] their face. Like I think it's just been
[87:44] funny. Yeah. I mean it's uh it's it's
[87:48] just such a uh such an improvement of
[87:50] your life experience when you just have
[87:52] Bitcoin and then you can watch all of
[87:53] this stuff knowing that Yes. You know,
[87:56] let them fight among themselves. It's
[87:58] all entertainment. It's all bread and
[87:59] circus as long as you have Bitcoin. Yes.
[88:01] It really is the cheat code.
[88:03] Yeah, I mean and the time preference is
[88:06] infinite, right? Like I have very high
[88:08] confidence in an ability to build for my
[88:11] future because of the stats I have in
[88:12] cold storage and those that have
[88:15] government bonds right now can't say the
[88:16] same.
[88:18] Yeah, but you know that's uh it's it's
[88:22] got to happen. This whole um funding war
[88:24] and endless government spending business
[88:27] has to come to an end. It's been a
[88:28] massive drag on our civilization for the
[88:30] last couple centuries and it's time for
[88:33] it to
[88:34] end. All right. What uh what else do you
[88:36] have in mind? Can you share with us what
[88:38] some more uh plans coming up?
[88:41] Um I mean I got some fun announcements
[88:43] at the Bitcoin conference uh you know at
[88:46] uh Yeah. Yeah. So we'll have some
[88:49] lending stuff. Uh we think we can
[88:52] achieve singledigit APR rates which
[88:55] would be an industryleading rate for
[88:57] those that want to borrow against their
[88:58] Bitcoin uh for some of our customers. A
[89:01] lot of lending announcements on the
[89:02] strike side. On the 21 side uh we intend
[89:06] to provide proof of reserves. Um we
[89:09] think it's important um to try and
[89:11] achieve that for a company of our size.
[89:14] So, uh, I'm hopeful that I I I can get
[89:17] that done, um, over the near-term
[89:20] future. So, yeah, the focus for 21 is
[89:23] what everyone should know is we
[89:24] announced an intent to go public, but
[89:26] that transaction hasn't closed. So, my
[89:28] job is working with regulators to get us
[89:31] listed on a stock exchange officially
[89:34] uh, under the ticker XXI and then
[89:36] educating the world, hopefully providing
[89:39] products like proof of reserves for our
[89:40] existing holdings. And then on the
[89:42] strike side, I've got some lending
[89:43] announcements. So, pretty exciting. And
[89:45] stacking stats on both sides of the of
[89:47] the balance sheets. Excellent. Keep at
[89:50] it, man. Keep at it. We're cheering for
[89:52] you. We're cheering for you here at the
[89:54] Bitcoin Standard Podcast. Jack, thank
[89:56] you so much again for joining us for
[89:58] your time and best of luck on
[89:59] everything. Thanks, Safe. I appreciate
[90:01] it. All right. Take care, my man. See
[90:05] [Music]
[90:06] you. Heat. Heat.
