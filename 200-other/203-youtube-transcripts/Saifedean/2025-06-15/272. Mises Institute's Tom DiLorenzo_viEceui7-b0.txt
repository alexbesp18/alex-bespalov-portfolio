[00:05] Hello, welcome to the Bitcoin Standard
[00:06] podcast. Our guest today is Dr. Thomas
[00:08] Dorenzo, the president of the Mises
[00:10] Institute, a distinguished economist
[00:12] known for his uncompromising critiques
[00:14] of government overreach and central
[00:16] planning. He's a former professor at
[00:18] Lyola University in Maryland, longtime
[00:20] faculty member at the Mises Institute,
[00:23] and an author whose work challenges
[00:25] conventional narratives in economics,
[00:26] history, and politics. Professor
[00:29] Dorenzo, thank you so much for joining
[00:31] us. It's an honor to have you. Well,
[00:32] it's my pleasure to be here. Thank you
[00:34] for inviting me.
[00:36] All right. So, I guess um there's a lot
[00:38] we could talk about from your work and
[00:41] I've learned a lot from you over the
[00:43] years. Um perhaps maybe we should take a
[00:46] chronological approach where we begin
[00:48] with your earlier work and then move on
[00:50] and then we can talk about the Mises
[00:51] Institute and your current role in the
[00:52] Mises Institute and how you see the
[00:54] Mises Institute uh moving forward. Does
[00:56] that sound good? Sure.
[00:59] All right. So, uh perhaps a good place
[01:00] to begin would be your work on US
[01:03] history, particularly Lincoln.
[01:06] Okay, we can start there. I'll give you
[01:09] a a little different uh topic before
[01:13] that. Um what I was sort of known for is
[01:17] I did a lot of writing on antitrust
[01:20] regulation in in early in my career and
[01:23] I published an article called the
[01:24] origins of antitrust in the
[01:26] international review of law and
[01:27] economics that challenged the idea that
[01:30] there was a need for anti- monopoly laws
[01:33] in the US in the late 19th century. And
[01:36] I found that uh that nobody at that time
[01:41] in the 1980s as of the 1980s had
[01:44] actually looked at data on what was
[01:47] happening with the prices and production
[01:50] in the United States at the time the
[01:52] antitrust laws were were invoked. This
[01:55] was the year 1890. And I found that the
[01:58] industries that were being accused of
[02:00] being monopolies had been dropping
[02:02] prices for for the previous decade and
[02:06] had been expanding production faster
[02:08] than GDP in general had been uh
[02:11] expanding some of them 10 or 15 times
[02:14] faster. This was the industrial
[02:16] revolution and these were the most
[02:17] dynamic competitive industries in
[02:19] America and they were targeted by their
[02:22] sour grapes competitors as monopolies
[02:25] which they weren't. they were they were
[02:27] good competitors. And so that's one
[02:30] thing that I'm I was known for before
[02:32] the Lincoln stuff. And then I also
[02:34] challenged the whole idea of natural
[02:36] monopoly. That was the theory behind why
[02:39] all the public utilities in the US,
[02:41] water supply,
[02:43] electricity, telephone services were all
[02:46] granted government monopolies.
[02:48] The theory goes that well if you allow
[02:50] the free market to work economies of
[02:52] scale will appear and they will create
[02:55] one big monopoly in all these industries
[02:57] and we don't want that. So therefore we
[03:00] need to create one big monopoly and we
[03:03] benevolent politicians will set the
[03:05] prices and so that happened all over
[03:07] America. But I I showed in my in my in
[03:10] an article that was in the review of
[03:11] Austrian economics way back in the in
[03:14] the 80s also that uh there was vigorous
[03:17] competition everywhere, electricity,
[03:19] telephone services and everything else.
[03:22] And how it came about was basically a
[03:25] loot sharing agreement between
[03:26] governments and corporations.
[03:29] uh in in in the city of Baltimore for
[03:31] example the the very first public
[03:34] utility monopoly was created when the
[03:37] the uh power company the electric power
[03:39] company today it's called B Baltimore
[03:41] gas and electric but this is turn of the
[03:44] 20th century they said we will give you
[03:47] the state of Maryland 15% of revenues
[03:50] every year if you give us a monopoly in
[03:53] in the production of of electric of
[03:56] light the light company and That's how
[03:59] it came about. It came about through
[04:01] corruption, cronyism, and politics and
[04:04] not the free market. And so that was
[04:06] sort of my background. And then I I
[04:08] became sort of a a Civil War buff. The
[04:10] American Civil War always fascinated me.
[04:12] What what what would motivate men to to
[04:15] to do the things that they did and uh
[04:18] being in an army and march into march
[04:20] into a 50,000man army with cannons and
[04:24] rifle pits and for what what what
[04:26] motivated them to do that? And uh and
[04:29] then in the course of that I got to uh
[04:32] wondering well how can I combine my
[04:33] profession economics with u this hobby
[04:37] of mine civil war history and I started
[04:40] reading about Lincoln and I started
[04:43] asking some of the Ivy League professors
[04:45] who were lecturing at the Smithsonian
[04:47] Institution at the time. I was taking a
[04:49] one a course, you know, in Civil War
[04:52] history through the Smithsonian
[04:54] Institution in Washington DC and they
[04:56] recommended this one book called The
[04:58] Lincoln and the American Dream. And the
[05:00] economics was horrible. It said silly
[05:02] things like Lincoln was a lifelong
[05:05] protectionist because he wanted the
[05:07] average man to have a chance to become
[05:09] wealthy like he had become wealthy. And
[05:11] it's just nonsense. And so that's how I
[05:14] got into uh writing articles about
[05:16] Lincoln. The Bitcoin Standard podcast is

[06:20] brought to you by the Daylight Computer.
[06:22] I love to work early in the morning and
[06:23] late at night or in the sun outdoors,
[06:25] but regular computer screens are
[06:27] terrible at these times and they strain
[06:29] your eyes. For years, I've wanted a
[06:31] paper-like electronic screen on a simple
[06:33] computer I could use to write. I tried
[06:36] several models, but none were very good.
[06:38] Now, finally, Daylight have delivered a
[06:41] fantastic full function tablet with a
[06:44] paper-like screen that's easy on your
[06:46] eyes and great for outdoor use. I've
[06:48] been using the Daylight computer to
[06:50] write my next book, and it is absolutely
[06:52] fantastic, and it has led me to invest
[06:54] in this company myself. Check out my
[06:57] interview with Anjan Kata in episode
[06:59] 249.
[07:01] Well, okay. Well, let's let's get back
[07:03] to the monopoly stuff because that's
[07:04] another part of your work that I uh
[07:05] enjoy. I quoted the uh that article you
[07:08] mentioned, the the myth of natural
[07:10] monopoly. I quote it in my uh principles
[07:13] of economics book. I I thought it was a
[07:16] great uh explanation of this. So the
[07:18] general idea here is that some
[07:20] industries are just naturally going to
[07:22] tend toward one producer and therefore
[07:25] it's better to just have that producer
[07:27] be a monopoly that is protected from
[07:31] competition that also has a monopoly on
[07:33] violence because that somehow is going
[07:35] to make it a more efficient monopoly.
[07:37] Have I got this right? Yes. basically
[07:41] and it's all it's all a fairy tale
[07:43] because uh even when I was in graduate
[07:45] school long before I wrote this article
[07:48] there was an economist named Walter
[07:50] Primo spelled P R I M E AUX who wrote a
[07:53] whole series of articles and I was
[07:55] thinking of writing my doctoral
[07:56] dissertation in this area because I was
[07:58] very interested in this at the time and
[08:00] he showed that uh in in America there
[08:03] there always were several dozen cities
[08:06] that did not do this that allowed direct
[08:09] competition ition in in the electric
[08:11] power industry and not not a profit
[08:14] sharing thing where the east side of the
[08:16] city is one company and the west side is
[08:17] the other. They all compete. They
[08:19] competed for everybody for all the
[08:21] customers and uh and that was very
[08:24] telling to me and and he found that sure
[08:26] enough in a situation like that you have
[08:28] lower prices and better services. And
[08:31] that's the exact opposite of what the
[08:33] so-called natural monopoly theory says.
[08:36] It says if you allow competition it'll
[08:38] evolve into monopoly and bad service and
[08:41] monopoly pricing and all that. And on
[08:44] top of that there's a literature in in
[08:46] law and economics quite a few articles
[08:48] published in the journal of law
[08:50] economics and elsewhere showing that uh
[08:53] of course when you put the pricing of
[08:55] utilities like electricity in the hands
[08:57] of politicians the price will be
[09:00] determined by politics. So it it all
[09:03] depends on who has more political clout.
[09:06] If the corporation has more clout, then
[09:07] you're going to get higher prices. If
[09:10] there's a sort of a reaction to that by
[09:12] a segment of the public that is
[09:15] successful, well then you'll get lower
[09:16] prices. And so even even though we have
[09:19] this theory of natural natural monopoly,
[09:22] it it assumed it always assumed that
[09:25] politicians would be like benevolent
[09:27] despots and always do what economists
[09:30] told them to do. But no, they do what
[09:31] what's best for themselves politically
[09:34] as all politicians do at all times.
[09:36] Yeah, absolutely. I think one of the
[09:38] absurd things about this natural
[09:39] monopoly argument is usually it relies
[09:42] on some version of economies of scale
[09:44] that in any particular town it's
[09:47] inefficient to have two different power
[09:49] plants. It's more thermodynamically
[09:51] efficient to have one power plant and so
[09:53] therefore it's going to tend to be a
[09:54] monopoly. But of course the reason this
[09:56] is absurd is that adherence of this
[09:59] theory apply it to every government,
[10:02] every city, every country from you know
[10:06] cities with a few hundred people,
[10:08] isolated little cities with a few
[10:09] hundred people with one small generator
[10:11] as well as countries with 20 million
[10:13] people where they need to have one
[10:16] electric utility. And so the
[10:18] thermodynamics can't
[10:20] possibly justify one power plant at
[10:23] every single scale. There has to be some
[10:27] benefits to scales. Yes, of course. In
[10:30] thermodynamics, the bigger the power
[10:31] plant, the more efficient the conversion
[10:33] of heat to energy because you get less
[10:35] heat loss, for instance, from thermal
[10:38] power plants. But there are also
[10:41] economies of diseconomies of scale.
[10:43] There are ways in which scale can be
[10:45] counterproductive. After a certain
[10:46] scale, then long transmission lines lead
[10:49] to more losses. They become too
[10:51] expensive. it becomes more economic to
[10:54] have several generators even if they're
[10:57] less thermodynamically efficient,
[10:58] they're more economically efficient
[11:00] because of the costs of transmission. So
[11:02] this uh the theory is clearly
[11:05] nonsensical because it is entirely based
[11:07] on the idea that whatever scale,
[11:09] whatever political scale we're
[11:11] discussing, it's always best optimized
[11:14] by having one power generator.
[11:17] Yeah. Well, of course, uh, in today's
[11:20] world, smaller towns and cities can buy
[11:23] electricity from a lot of different
[11:25] sources, and that that changes
[11:27] everything. And the another basis of the
[11:29] theory is that these costs are are fixed
[11:33] somehow. And and so the government steps
[11:35] in and creates a monopoly. And what that
[11:37] usually does, it says no more
[11:40] competitive discovery is allowed. And
[11:42] it's competition. You know, the Austrian
[11:45] economists say competition is a dynamic
[11:47] discovery process and and it is. And so,
[11:51] who knows what kind of technology would
[11:52] have been discovered had the government
[11:54] not stepped in in the early 20th century
[11:56] and created these monopolies everywhere
[11:58] and basically said no more no more R&D,
[12:02] you know, no more no more research and
[12:04] alternative uh ways of uh generating
[12:07] electricity and and selling electricity,
[12:09] you know, we know what is best for you.
[12:11] So, it's just the same old sort of
[12:13] central planning mentality that a small
[12:16] group of people uh advised by some wise
[12:19] economists
[12:20] uh very well- paid wise economists I
[12:23] would assume u as consultants to the
[12:26] state uh you know would would do that.
[12:29] That's sort of the whole the fatal
[12:30] conceit as Friedrich Hayatt called it
[12:32] about about government planning. Yeah,
[12:35] absolutely. And it's I mean the the uh
[12:38] what whatever the merits of the argument
[12:40] on terms of uh scale ultimately what
[12:44] they're saying is a monopoly that
[12:46] emerges naturally on the market is too
[12:49] dangerous even though people have the
[12:51] option of just not buying their products
[12:53] building their own alternative going to
[12:56] some other alternative uh producer
[12:59] extending power lines from another town.
[13:01] All these things are possible when you
[13:02] have a market monopoly, some bogey man.
[13:06] But none of these things are possible
[13:07] when you have a government monopoly
[13:09] because that government monopoly has a
[13:11] gun and it will shoot you if you object
[13:14] to it. They'll throw you in jail if you
[13:15] set up a competing power plant to the
[13:18] one that even I an academic could make
[13:21] money with an ironclad monopoly enforced
[13:24] by
[13:25] violence. Who who who can't make a lot
[13:27] of money in that kind of situation? And
[13:29] and of course once any government
[13:31] program is established it
[13:34] creates sort of a a collection of
[13:37] special interests that profit from that
[13:39] program the employees and the the
[13:42] stockholders and and if there are
[13:44] stockholders and so forth and so and
[13:47] that creates a very difficult time in
[13:49] ever getting rid of it and deregulating
[13:52] uh and you know in the US when we
[13:54] deregulated airlines
[13:56] uh the civil aeronautics board created
[13:58] basically a monopoly, a cartel situation
[14:01] for the airlines by making it illegal to
[14:04] cut prices. And and there were more
[14:06] airlines in America, companies in the
[14:09] 1930s, than there were in the 1970s. And
[14:13] even big statists like uh Senator Ted
[14:16] Kennedy and Ralph Nater were in favor of
[14:19] deregulating the airlines because it was
[14:21] such an obvious monopoly scam. But it
[14:25] took what uh 40 years uh for that to
[14:29] happen for the politics to finally
[14:31] realize that this was a bad deal for the
[14:33] vast majority of people and the
[14:35] politicians turned around and and
[14:37] deregulated airlines partially anyway,
[14:40] but they're still under the boot of the
[14:41] Federal Aviation Administration and and
[14:44] in the US the airports are almost all of
[14:47] them are run by state or local
[14:49] governments.
[14:50] Yeah. Yeah. And I think it's um it's
[14:53] it's it's remarkable for me as somebody
[14:54] who travels a lot all over the world,
[14:57] it's remarkable for me that generally uh
[14:59] airlines in the US and airports in the
[15:01] US
[15:02] are fairly below global average. I mean,
[15:06] you travel around some of the Middle
[15:08] Eastern airlines and some of their
[15:09] airports is so much better organized, so
[15:11] much cleaner, so much more likely to be
[15:13] on time, a lot less uh problems happen.
[15:17] And it's pretty startling, you know,
[15:19] because the US is not a cheap place.
[15:21] People have a lot of uh income. You
[15:24] would expect that airplanes and airlines
[15:26] would do well. But what is it now with
[15:29] airlines? They go bankrupt roughly every
[15:32] 10 years or so, every seven years, and
[15:34] then they get bailed out. And the
[15:36] airports rely on public money. And um
[15:39] there's not a lot of competition here.
[15:41] Whereas with smaller countries, I think
[15:43] even though they the airlines and
[15:46] airports are staterun, they are small
[15:48] countries. So effectively they're
[15:51] competing on the global stage. SoQatar
[15:54] doesn't have Yeah. They have a monopoly
[15:55] on airports and but is a tiny little
[15:57] island. So they're out there competing
[15:59] with all of the airlines of the world
[16:01] for running flights across the world.
[16:03] And so they have to get their act
[16:05] together. And so as I said, it's a much
[16:07] better experience. Yeah. That's how
[16:08] that's how Japan broke into the highly
[16:11] protected American car industry in the
[16:13] 1960s and 70s. They they had they were,
[16:17] you know, in bad shape economically
[16:19] after World War II, but they did it for
[16:22] sure. And a friend of mine that traveled
[16:25] to Bali, I think it was Singapore
[16:27] Airlines, he told me when they finally
[16:29] landed uh back home, he said, "Do I
[16:32] really have to get off the plane?" He
[16:33] didn't want to get off the plane. He was
[16:36] so comfortable.
[16:38] Yeah, agreed. The difference in airlines
[16:41] and airplanes is quite startling. U
[16:44] okay, I want to discuss antitrust. So
[16:46] this is the the prevailing idea that
[16:49] people have about this is that in the
[16:51] 19th century there were all these evil
[16:52] people called the robber barons and
[16:55] these people controlled all of the
[16:57] industries of the US. all the major
[16:58] industries. They were in charge of the
[17:00] industrialization and they all had
[17:02] monopolies and it only was the um genius
[17:07] guiding hand of the state that made them
[17:10] relinquish these monopolies, broke up
[17:11] their companies into smaller companies,
[17:13] allowed for competition and uh in and
[17:17] and because of that it increased the
[17:19] living standards of Americans and made
[17:21] these goods more and more affordable.
[17:23] Tell us why that's nonsense.
[17:26] Well, you you can study history. Um,
[17:28] there's a book by a little book by a man
[17:32] Burton Fulsome is the author's name.
[17:34] It's the myth of the robber barons. And
[17:36] it's a straightforward history of the
[17:38] reality of these people. And one good
[17:39] example is a man named James J. Hill,
[17:43] who was, you know, called a robber baron
[17:45] at the time. At the time, the government
[17:48] after the American Civil War uh very
[17:51] heavily subsidized two big
[17:53] transcontinental railroads that went
[17:55] from the the American Midwest to
[17:58] California. And James J. Hill was an
[18:02] entrepreneur. He was a Canadian who came
[18:04] to America. He had one eye. His father
[18:07] died when he was nine. And he had to
[18:09] help his mother raise I think he had six
[18:11] siblings. and uh and he he saved every
[18:15] penny as a young man working for various
[18:17] businesses and he bought into a railroad
[18:21] company by the time he was he was older
[18:24] and he eventually got investors to
[18:27] invest in with him to create the great
[18:30] Northern Railroad, a totally privately
[18:32] funded railroad that would compete with
[18:34] the government subsidized
[18:35] transcontinental railroads. And he got
[18:37] no land grants from the American
[18:39] government like the other railroads did.
[18:41] free land. He would pay the American
[18:43] Indians uh for the rights of way through
[18:46] their property with cattle, you know,
[18:49] whatever they could trade for. The the
[18:52] government subsidized railroads, on the
[18:53] other hand, would call in the US Army
[18:56] and shoot all the Indians and getting
[18:58] get them out of the way. And that was a
[19:00] way of socializing the cost of building
[19:03] the government subsidized railroads. But
[19:05] the bottom line is James J. Hill just
[19:08] out competed these other two uh the
[19:11] Northern Pacific and the Central Pacific
[19:13] railroads because he was a free market
[19:16] entrepreneur. And so therefore the
[19:18] government castigated him as an evil
[19:20] robber baron. They even later on at the
[19:23] turn of the this was all in the 1870s
[19:25] when this began in the 1880s, the Great
[19:28] Northern Railroad. And by the 20 years
[19:31] later, one of the very first antitrust
[19:34] lawsuits in America sued James J. Hills
[19:37] Company. So the government had a grudge,
[19:39] a decadesl long grudge against this man
[19:41] that made them look like damn fools with
[19:44] their their their crazy subsidies. And
[19:47] and and the government subsidized
[19:48] railroads were a huge mess. I used to
[19:51] talk about this to my college students
[19:53] and I would write a map on a blackboard
[19:56] with a bunch of squiggly lines that
[19:57] looked like a bowl of spaghetti and say,
[19:59] "Well, that's the the railroad lines of
[20:01] the government subsidized railroads."
[20:03] Because because uh every member of
[20:05] Congress would say, "I'll vote for the
[20:07] subsidy, but you have to run a line to
[20:09] my small town of 500 people." And and
[20:12] then I would put the actual on the
[20:15] internet from the internet on the
[20:16] screen. you know, but the actual roots
[20:18] of the the government subsidized
[20:19] railroads, and it did look like a bowl
[20:21] of spaghetti, whereas James J. Hills was
[20:23] almost as straight a line as you can
[20:25] draw from the upper Midwest to the west
[20:28] coast of the United States through the
[20:30] Rocky Mountains because it was all about
[20:32] efficiency and profitability to him. And
[20:35] that's the kind of thing that you read
[20:37] all throughout this book, The Myth of
[20:38] the Robert Barons. John D. Rockefeller
[20:41] became the richest man in the world by
[20:43] dropping the price of refined kerosene
[20:46] year after year after year for for
[20:49] decades and and and creating dozens of
[20:52] new products like Vaseline from the the
[20:54] residue from from uh from his oil from
[20:58] the petroleum and and although some of
[21:00] these people the so-called robber barons
[21:03] changed later on maybe got involved in
[21:05] some of them not James Jill but some of
[21:07] them got involved in politics and did
[21:09] become sort crony capitalists and not
[21:11] free market entrepreneurs. But that
[21:14] story is a in general a a phony story.
[21:19] Yeah, I've u I I remember coming across
[21:22] this as well in Marty Rothbard's The
[21:25] Progressive Era, which is a great book,
[21:26] another great Rothbart book. And I found
[21:29] it pretty startling uh just how many
[21:32] examples he cites of this. Uh I I think
[21:35] he cites your book or do you site his? I
[21:38] can't remember which one was published
[21:39] first on this. Yeah, I probably cited
[21:41] more of Murray Rothmar than he cited of
[21:43] me.
[21:44] Yeah, I'm not sure, but the progressive
[21:46] era was one of his later works, so he
[21:48] may have cited in that one. Yeah. Yeah,
[21:50] that was actually a written handwritten
[21:52] manuscript that my uh a Mises Institute
[21:56] fellow named Patrick Newman. Yes. Got
[21:59] all the handwritten manuscript and and
[22:01] put it into a book and the Mises
[22:02] Institute published as a book. Yes,
[22:05] we've had Patrick Newman on here. He's a
[22:07] friend of the show and we're looking
[22:08] forward to having him on again. He's uh
[22:10] always interesting to chat with. He has
[22:11] a new book that we are going to publish
[22:13] in in another couple of months on called
[22:16] on cronyism 2. He wrote a book on
[22:18] cronyism in American politics up until I
[22:23] think 1850 and this one is 1850 to a
[22:27] more modern era.
[22:30] What what I found fascinating about this
[22:32] idea of the robber barons. So first of
[22:35] all uh the the discussion of this idea
[22:37] that they are ruthless monopolists
[22:40] exploiting the people is just
[22:42] economically illiterate. I mean John D.
[22:45] Rockefeller in particular you could lay
[22:48] a decent claim to say that he was the
[22:50] man who invented the modern world. He
[22:52] was the man who invented the industrial
[22:53] world of the 20th century. Yes. by uh
[22:57] turning crude oil into these homogeneous
[23:00] products that were reliably delivered in
[23:03] del in in standard that was the whole
[23:06] point standard you know standard
[23:08] containers standard uh shipment u he
[23:12] standardized the entire process of
[23:13] getting energy to people and completely
[23:15] transformed people's lives by giving
[23:17] people cheap kerosene and then uh
[23:19] cheaper gasoline and so on. It was truly
[23:22] truly one of the most impactful uh he
[23:26] actions anybody has done. He's really
[23:28] one of the greatest humans to ever live
[23:30] in my mind because he managed this
[23:32] company as it went from just one small
[23:35] Ohio oil producer to the global leader
[23:40] in the industry of oil. And it's
[23:44] improved the lives of billions of people
[23:46] all over the world and it continues to
[23:47] do so until today. And he did all of
[23:50] that while the price of his product was
[23:52] declining. Every year almost kerosene
[23:55] was getting cheaper. All of his products
[23:57] continued to get cheaper because he used
[23:58] the fact that he could he managed the
[24:01] companies really well. He used economies
[24:02] of scale and he negotiated great deals
[24:05] with the railroads and so on. And all of
[24:08] that led to him providing people with a
[24:10] lot of cheap kerosene and a lot of cheap
[24:12] products. And that's why everybody used
[24:14] his products. So the idea that he was
[24:16] out there exploiting people is
[24:17] ridiculous because all the alternatives
[24:19] were offering people much more expensive
[24:22] kerosene. And it's it's ridiculous uh to
[24:26] present this as evil. And I recently
[24:29] read a book by uh Walter Isaxson I think
[24:32] it was who wrote a biography of
[24:34] Rockefeller called Titan.
[24:36] And I found it amazing how
[24:39] know 21st century journalist or late
[24:42] 20th century journalist u is just so
[24:46] critical of so much of Rockefeller's
[24:48] life and completely without any any any
[24:51] reason to do so. I mean, you're just a
[24:54] writer who's writing about the guy who's
[24:56] created the 20th century and he's just
[25:00] constantly passing judgment on how he
[25:03] acted. And and I found it truly, I
[25:06] think, one of the worst manifestations
[25:09] of the anti- capitalist sentiment that
[25:11] you see growing in the 20th century in
[25:13] the US. And I think this vilification of
[25:15] the robber barons presenting them as if
[25:18] they're evil people was a monumental
[25:21] shift in the uh perception of free
[25:25] enterprise and capitalism in the US
[25:26] perhaps in that after this everybody
[25:29] started well not everybody but
[25:30] increasingly people began to see that if
[25:33] you're a rich businessman then you must
[25:35] have done it by exploiting people by
[25:36] taking advantage of people and they
[25:38] missed the fact that he was out there
[25:40] giving people cheap products and I think
[25:43] And it's laughable the the book in in
[25:46] the book Titan there's um there's a you
[25:48] know there's whole sections in which the
[25:49] author is just being very moralizing
[25:52] about how um
[25:55] uh Rockefeller is doing evil things
[26:00] and you know um and he made sure to keep
[26:03] the prices of his kerosene lows to avoid
[26:06] criticism. You know, this is the this
[26:07] smile small little detail. While he was
[26:09] out there evil and exploiting people, he
[26:12] tricked people by giving them the thing
[26:14] that made their life infinitely better
[26:16] at an infinitely lower cost than they
[26:18] could afford it just so that they would
[26:20] think that he's a good person when in
[26:22] fact he was out there to get rich. And
[26:26] he he he makes it sound like he's such
[26:28] an evil person. And I came out of the
[26:30] book um really sympathetic to
[26:34] Rockefeller. I thought he was uh I I I
[26:37] thought I would see something critical.
[26:38] I would I I kept looking for the evil
[26:40] part and I couldn't find it. Now
[26:42] granted, a lot of people have misgivings
[26:44] about Rockefeller's charity work, his
[26:46] foundations, the things that his
[26:48] foundations have done with modern
[26:50] medicine, but a I I don't have strong
[26:53] opinions on that because I'm not quite
[26:55] clear on how strong his own personal
[26:57] role in that was. He was already mostly
[26:59] retired at that point and focusing on
[27:01] his golf. Um, but when you look at
[27:05] Rockefeller, the businessman, putting
[27:06] aside his charity work, whatever you
[27:08] think of it, which for me, the juryy's
[27:10] out on that, but as a businessman, I
[27:12] mean, the guy is one of the greatest
[27:13] humans to ever live. I think I don't
[27:15] think you could fault him. And he was a
[27:16] truly moral person, truly cared for the
[27:19] poor. He gave to charity so much and he
[27:22] genuinely understood that giving people
[27:23] cheap products was a was the way in
[27:25] which he's contributing to society. And
[27:27] it's just something that flies over the
[27:29] head of all of u well not all but a lot
[27:32] of the moderns who think of him as being
[27:35] evil.
[27:37] Yeah. You know that's you mentioned the
[27:39] word standard how he standardized all
[27:41] these things. It was the name of the
[27:42] company was Standard Oil Company and he
[27:45] was rewarded for all of
[27:47] this by the government suing his company
[27:50] under the antitrust law and breaking it
[27:52] up. they broke up his company uh even
[27:55] even though uh there was no evidence
[27:58] whatsoever that he he harmed any
[28:01] consumers. Uh it's another example of
[28:03] the the uh
[28:05] uh the mainstream of the economics
[28:08] profession being propagandists for
[28:10] statism. Uh and you know when the
[28:12] American Economic Association was
[28:14] founded in
[28:16] 1887, their founding document condemned
[28:19] lay far as they called it unsound in
[28:22] practice and unsafe in morals and and
[28:25] they came up with this theory of
[28:26] predatory pricing claiming that
[28:29] Rockefeller and people like him who oh
[28:32] who yes they they dropped prices of
[28:34] their products for 30 years. rocket
[28:37] failure 30 years price cut after price
[28:39] cut after price cut
[28:41] because they're hoping in someday they
[28:45] will drive everybody else from the
[28:46] market and then look out monopoly. So
[28:49] they'll lose money on purpose on every
[28:51] sale for 30 or 40 years and then become
[28:54] a that's the theory that was used to
[28:56] justify this the antitrust lawsuit
[28:59] against John D. Rockefeller and it broke
[29:02] his company up into Standard Oil of
[29:03] Ohio, Standard Oil of New Jersey and he
[29:07] was punished for it just like James J.
[29:09] Hill was punished by the state for for
[29:12] embarrassing uh the government run
[29:15] government subsidized railroads and and
[29:18] yeah Rockefeller I don't think he had
[29:19] much to do with the Rockefeller
[29:21] Foundation. There's there's a lot of
[29:23] examples of these foundations that are
[29:25] taken over by the left. Uh my my good
[29:27] friend Tom Woods says I can paraphrase
[29:30] him. They said no no no good deed done
[29:32] by a free market entrepreneur ever goes
[29:35] unpunished. And eventually when when
[29:38] Walmart came about and start and got
[29:40] into the grocery business in America and
[29:42] they started underpricing the unionized
[29:45] grocery stores with cheap groceries,
[29:48] they were attacked for 20 years by the
[29:50] unions in their and the media as being
[29:53] evil. not as evil as Rockefeller, but
[29:56] but the cheap groceries, we can't have
[29:59] that. And it's sort of the same story
[30:01] over and over again, isn't it? Yeah. I
[30:04] should just make one small correction. I
[30:05] said that the uh Titan book on
[30:08] Rockefeller was written by Walter Isax.
[30:10] That was wrong. It's actually written by
[30:12] Ron Cherno. Uh but uh
[30:16] he's he's another socialist
[30:18] propagandist.
[30:20] He wrote a big book also on Alexander
[30:22] Hamilton and one of my books is called
[30:23] Hamilton's Curse. I'm not a Hamilton
[30:25] fan, but there are things in that book
[30:27] too that he he praises Hamilton for
[30:31] being an abolitionist because he made
[30:33] some nice talk about anti-slavery talk.
[30:37] But then in one passage of the book, he
[30:39] he describes how Hamilton himself once
[30:41] purchased slaves. He went to a slave
[30:44] auction and purchased slaves. And so how
[30:46] can you be anti-slavery and purchase
[30:48] slaves at the same time? So when you
[30:50] read these biographies of famous people
[30:53] by people like Ron Cherno, uh you have
[30:56] to be uh careful. It's kind of like
[30:57] reading a Bill Clinton speech. Yeah,
[31:01] that's a good metaphor. It is. Um, and I
[31:04] but I think if you're uh if you're aware
[31:06] of these biases, if you've read if
[31:08] you've been inoculated by reading some
[31:09] Rothbard earlier, that it's actually
[31:11] quite illuminating to read this leftist
[31:14] take on Rockefeller or other luminaries
[31:17] because you can see where uh you can see
[31:20] where the propaganda has to be uh has to
[31:23] be jackhammered in to the story. Yeah.
[31:27] The Yeah. the famous book, The Jungle,
[31:29] about the meat packing business. That
[31:31] was another miracle of uh the industrial
[31:34] revolution, how they they were able to
[31:37] package frozen beef and ship it all over
[31:40] the country and people could buy beef
[31:42] much cheaper than they than the the
[31:44] local monopoly butcher was selling it to
[31:46] them. And uh and so of course, you know,
[31:49] they had to be demonized.
[31:53] Hello. Yes. Yeah. So, sorry we we lost
[31:57] you again for some reason. The last
[31:58] thing we got was people could buy beef
[32:00] much cheaper.
[32:02] Yes. And so the beef trust, as it was
[32:04] called, had to be demonized because they
[32:06] provided cheap cheap meat to to people
[32:10] all over America. The same with the
[32:12] Rockefeller story. Yeah, it's it's
[32:15] pretty remarkable. And reading the FDR
[32:18] uh sorry, the Rockefeller story, um I
[32:20] mean, look, the workers were very happy.
[32:22] They were getting paid better than other
[32:24] companies. The shareholders were very
[32:26] happy. A lot of people got rich by
[32:27] owning Standard Oil stock and the
[32:30] customers most importantly were very
[32:31] happy and the only people that were
[32:34] really upset were generatively the
[32:36] competitors, the people who lost out
[32:38] because they weren't as good as him. And
[32:40] I think the the most famous
[32:43] uh of the people who attacked
[32:45] Rockefeller was I think her name was a
[32:47] Ada Love Lace. She was a journalist who
[32:50] kept attacking him at that time. Ada
[32:52] Tarbell. Ida Tarbell. Yes, I bel and she
[32:56] happened to be the daughter or the
[32:58] sister of a major oil producer who went
[33:01] out of business and was bought out by
[33:03] Rockefeller because he was just much
[33:04] better. So, it's a very small, very loud
[33:07] minority of people that are uh
[33:09] presenting their own grievances with
[33:11] somebody who was just more successful
[33:13] than them as if it is an a damning
[33:16] indictment of this person and completely
[33:19] dismissing all of the customers,
[33:20] shareholders, and workers who benefited
[33:22] from this. Yeah, Ida Tarbell in her
[33:25] book, it's called uh cutting to kill was
[33:28] a chapter of a book on the Standard Oil
[33:30] Company and cutting to kill price
[33:33] cutting, you know, you offering people
[33:35] cheaper cheaper valuable products.
[33:38] That's that's it's killing them and and
[33:40] but she admitted that it was a she
[33:42] called it a marvelous example of
[33:44] efficiency in the whole Rockefeller
[33:46] operation. And she even praised his
[33:48] brother who was apparently a a business
[33:50] genius. And a lot of the things that are
[33:53] taught in MBA schools today in
[33:55] accounting and finance and things were
[33:57] were adopted by the Rockefeller
[33:58] organized by the Rockefeller
[34:00] organization. and uh and and despite
[34:03] calling him his operation a marvelous
[34:06] example of efficiency, she condemned it
[34:08] all because as you said, I think it was
[34:10] her brother who the pure oil company was
[34:13] put out of business or bought out by
[34:15] Rockefeller because they just couldn't
[34:16] compete. They weren't they they couldn't
[34:19] compete on cost and and everything else.
[34:22] Yep. And it was a similar story with the
[34:24] steel industry, right?
[34:27] Yeah. The steel was like that. There are
[34:29] many examples like like that.
[34:31] U sort of an entertaining example was uh
[34:34] Cornelius Vanderbilt, the railroad baron
[34:38] as he was called. He got his start in
[34:40] business. He was hired by a man to run a
[34:43] ferry boat down the Hudson River outside
[34:46] of New York City and he decided to
[34:48] charge zero. The price of getting on the
[34:51] ferry was zero. And he made his money by
[34:54] selling food and drinks on the ferry
[34:56] boat. And it was illegal because the
[34:58] other the other companies had a
[35:00] government monopoly on the ferryboat
[35:03] service, kind of like the public utility
[35:05] monopoly. And he had the police chasing
[35:07] him up and down the Hudson River. And
[35:09] they the police finally gave up and he
[35:11] broke up the monopoly, the government
[35:13] monopoly there. And then, you know, he
[35:16] later on in in his life, he became a
[35:19] railroad entrepreneur and uh and and
[35:23] underpriced his competitors in that
[35:25] business, too.
[35:28] Yeah, so many examples. I think the term
[35:31] Robert Baron is a great example of a
[35:33] scop. I think it's uh if you see anybody
[35:36] referring to somebody as a Robert Baron,
[35:38] then it's generally likely that person
[35:41] is a victim of a scop because Baron is
[35:44] sort of a European elitist or something
[35:47] like that. But James J. Hill, who I
[35:49] mentioned earlier, was anything but a
[35:51] baron. Like I said, he he was orphan.
[35:53] His father died at when he was a nine
[35:56] years old. He had to raise his siblings.
[35:58] He went to work at nine years old making
[36:01] pennies to support his his family. Uh
[36:04] and he he worked diligently. He's a very
[36:07] brilliant man. and his whole life, even
[36:10] when when he when he was running this
[36:11] big railroad, the Great Northern, if uh
[36:14] if there was a some reason why someone
[36:16] got hurt or couldn't finish the job, he
[36:18] he would actually pick up a shovel and
[36:20] help the help the guys on the line
[36:22] making the making the railroad beds if
[36:24] he was around. And and and that's kind
[36:27] of person he was. He was hardly a baron.
[36:28] And he didn't rob anybody. He didn't rob
[36:31] anybody. He g like Rockefeller. gave
[36:33] them great products at lower prices than
[36:35] anyone else could charge at the time.
[36:39] Yeah. And of course, the same people who
[36:41] tell you about all these evil
[36:42] capitalists out there giving people
[36:44] cheap trains and cheap feries and cheap
[36:47] uh kerosene, they don't seem to have
[36:50] much bad to say about the actual uh
[36:55] criminal monopolies out there like the
[36:56] Federal Reserve and the people who
[36:58] established that. So those people don't
[37:00] count as Robert Barren for some reason.
[37:02] You know, they're barely mentioned in
[37:04] that same vein. Yeah. Well, you know,
[37:07] Murray Rothbart, you mentioned his book,
[37:09] The Progressive Era, and he discusses in
[37:11] that book and in many other places how
[37:14] uh an essential part of the the cement
[37:17] of statism is the state always has to to
[37:21] have paid in intellectuals to to to
[37:24] justify what they're doing. And that's
[37:27] always been a part of it. They can't use
[37:28] violence and coercion all the time
[37:30] because that that's could be a threat to
[37:32] the state because there might be a
[37:34] reaction. There might be a blowback by
[37:36] the public if they use too much
[37:37] violence. It's easier to brainwash
[37:40] people sometimes there, you know,
[37:42] especially when you control the
[37:43] government schools. And so, and so
[37:45] that's another example of reason of why
[37:48] we see this. There's always a core of
[37:50] not necessarily academics but
[37:53] journalists uh and newspaper owners and
[37:57] people who are connected and who profit
[37:59] in some way from their association with
[38:01] the state and that's where all of this
[38:03] comes from.
[38:05] Yeah. And that's you know it's I think
[38:07] it's very telling that the entrepreneur
[38:10] who builds something that's actually
[38:11] useful that helps lies a million is
[38:14] vilified as a Robert Baron. the banking
[38:17] cartel that is protected by the
[38:18] government, the Federal Reserve, it's
[38:21] completely immune to criticism. You
[38:22] know, it's a government institution.
[38:24] It's run with the best of intentions.
[38:25] All of these people are just out there,
[38:28] you know, they're not giving people
[38:29] cheap services. They're not making
[38:32] people's lives better. They're doing the
[38:34] government thing of continuing to rob
[38:35] people and monopolizing the industry at
[38:38] their expense. The Fed was created
[38:40] during the same era that all these other
[38:42] monopolies, the public utility
[38:44] monopolies,
[38:46] uh the the civil civil anotics board
[38:49] that monopolized airlines, the
[38:50] interstate commerce commission
[38:52] monopolized the railroad industry
[38:54] because the first president the first
[38:57] head of it was a railroad industry
[39:00] president and they made it illegal to
[39:02] compete there. And that was the the the
[39:04] uh the political uh era era that uh that
[39:09] existed at the time the Fed was created.
[39:11] It was just another government cartel
[39:13] operation because the banks uh wanted to
[39:17] inflate and their currency. And if you
[39:20] don't have gold or so and silver in
[39:22] reserve in sufficient amounts, you could
[39:25] be in trouble. And that of course puts a
[39:27] block on the ability of banks to
[39:29] inflate, which is why they didn't want
[39:31] it. But if they could all inflate at the
[39:33] same time and then have a a lender of
[39:36] last resort, which is a sort of another
[39:38] word of saying, "We will bail bail you
[39:40] out if you make too many bad loans."
[39:43] Well, then you're basically just another
[39:45] governmentrun cartel for the banking
[39:47] industry. They got theirs. The railroad
[39:49] industry got theirs. The trucking
[39:51] industry got theirs with the ICC. The
[39:53] airline industry got theirs with the
[39:56] civil aeronautics board. the banking
[39:57] industry on their governmentr run cartel
[40:01] operation with the Fed.
[40:05] Absolutely. And that's rarely ever ever
[40:09] criticized. Rarely ever problematized to
[40:12] use a favorite word of the uh leftist
[40:15] court intellectuals. Um you you'll spend
[40:18] forever problematizing people who serve
[40:21] people voluntarily on the market, but
[40:23] government monopolies are beyond
[40:25] reproach usually. Yeah, you know, when
[40:27] when Thomas Jefferson had a debate with
[40:29] Alexander Hamilton over the
[40:31] constitutionality of a national bank run
[40:34] by politicians, that is they're debating
[40:36] the Bank of the United States, which was
[40:38] a precursor to the Fed. Uh Jefferson
[40:41] looked at Hamilton's case
[40:44] for a bank and he and he concluded that
[40:47] it was intentionally confusing and
[40:50] obfuscating because they only wanted the
[40:52] insiders to really know what was going
[40:54] on, how this whole system would work at
[40:57] the same time. And I think that was I
[40:59] think old Thomas Jefferson was right on
[41:00] the money with that. And uh there's an
[41:04] economist named Larry White. He's an
[41:06] Austrian school economist. He taught at
[41:07] George Mason University for many years.
[41:09] He published an article in an academic
[41:11] journal where he surveyed the monet the
[41:15] monetary journals in the academic world
[41:17] like the journal of monetary economics
[41:18] and and a bunch of others and he
[41:21] concluded that about 75% of all the
[41:24] academic journal articles published on
[41:27] monetary policy were published by people
[41:29] associated with the Fed in some way
[41:32] meaning paid by the Fed in some way. And
[41:35] even some of the journals themselves are
[41:36] actually paid for by the Fed. And you
[41:39] know, Milton Friedman once said, "If you
[41:41] want a career as an academic monetary
[41:44] economist, it's a good idea not to
[41:46] criticize the main employer in your
[41:48] profession." And so, we get all this
[41:51] propaganda from the academic world
[41:53] praising the Fed. I once had a senior
[41:55] economics major in one of my classes
[41:57] come to me and I was teaching a course
[41:59] in American economic history and he
[42:02] said, "You know, I've taken the whole
[42:03] curriculum. I'm going to graduate. I've
[42:05] taken all the monetary courses and
[42:07] macroeconomics courses and I had no idea
[42:10] that there were criticisms of the Fed
[42:12] out there and they had been taught any
[42:14] until I got to my class. But when I was
[42:17] in school, you know, 150 years ago, and
[42:20] I took monetary economics, we we we
[42:23] learned all about the monitorrists
[42:24] versus the Keynesians. And there were a
[42:26] lot of criticisms of the Fed that I was
[42:28] taught even as an undergraduate, but
[42:30] apparently no longer at a lot of a lot
[42:32] of universities. The Bitcoin Standard

[44:05] uh wake up moments.
[44:06] I'd begun to be to read Austrians around
[44:10] 2007 and then when the financial crisis
[44:12] happened having read a little bit of
[44:14] Hayek and maybe only a tiny bit of
[44:16] Rothbart at that time but I was still
[44:19] inoculated enough to just notice how
[44:21] ridiculous it was that academic
[44:23] economists were just out there um
[44:26] basically translating what Ben Bernani
[44:28] and John Pollson were saying to the lay
[44:30] man. That's their entire job. And so one
[44:33] day they're going on about how oh the
[44:36] the financial the financial system is
[44:38] fine, everything is safe and there's no
[44:41] need to bail out the banks because that
[44:42] would create moral hazard. And then the
[44:44] next day because that's what Ben Bernaki
[44:47] would have said. And then the next day
[44:49] Ben Bernaki says, "Yep, we had to give
[44:51] um Goldman Sachs $80 trillion or
[44:54] whatever." Yeah. because otherwise, you
[44:56] know, your shelves would have run out of
[44:58] food and you'd be all starving and
[45:01] riding in the streets. And then all of
[45:03] these economists in unison get together
[45:06] and just start repeating all of that
[45:07] stuff on their blogs, in their classes,
[45:09] in their universities, on their uh uh
[45:12] newspaper columns. Yeah. Well, that we
[45:14] had to give Goldman Sachs $80 trillion
[45:16] because if we did it, then the food on
[45:18] your shelf would have run out. And
[45:19] that's what passes for academic
[45:21] economics these days. You just repeat
[45:23] what power says. Yeah. Yeah, you know,
[45:25] David Stockman wrote a book called The
[45:27] Great Deformationation. Big I think it's
[45:29] a thousandpage book. I've reviewed it
[45:32] for the review of a quarterly journal of
[45:35] Austrian economics. But he he discusses
[45:37] this in great detail. And he shows that
[45:39] Goldman Sachs and and some of these
[45:41] other companies, they were not they were
[45:44] not going to go out of business. They
[45:45] had, you know, a few lines of their
[45:47] business were were were in bad shape
[45:49] because of all the bad loans that they
[45:51] had in their portfolio, mortgage loans.
[45:54] But but they were fine. They were going
[45:56] to go out of business. And then u and
[45:58] what happened was they got the big
[46:00] bailouts. Then all the executives got
[46:02] their normal, you know, uh 20 million
[46:06] $30 million bonuses for for the for the
[46:08] year. So they actually got big bonuses
[46:11] the year that they they lost all this
[46:13] money. And the bonuses, of course, came
[46:15] from the bailout money. and and Stockman
[46:18] writes that that's what the bailouts
[46:19] were all about to make sure all the
[46:21] executives got their bonuses for the for
[46:23] the year regardless of performance and
[46:26] you know talk about moral hazard
[46:28] problems but that's going to and I
[46:30] remember at the time also by the way
[46:32] that there were articles by uh in the
[46:35] Wall Street Journal and the Financial
[46:37] Times arguing that the cause of the
[46:40] crash was the Fed was not powerful
[46:42] enough. I think I think it was uh John
[46:45] Steel Gordon the business historian had
[46:48] an article I think it was the Wall
[46:49] Street Journal and he blamed it on Ron
[46:52] Paul. He said Ron Paul is sort of the
[46:55] the modernday Jefferson and because
[46:57] Jefferson was a big critic of a national
[46:59] bank run by politicians and there's Ron
[47:02] Paul out there because Ron was running
[47:03] for the Republican nomination at the
[47:05] time and he's been on the board of the
[47:07] Mises Institute for 43 years by the way.
[47:10] Ron Paul and uh and and so here's John
[47:13] Steel Gordon in the Wall Street Journal
[47:15] saying it's because the Fed is not
[47:16] powerful enough and then there's Henry
[47:19] Kaufman in the Financial Times was
[47:21] writing at the time that u the problem
[47:25] is that Alan Greenspan was an associate
[47:29] of Ein Rand as a young man. Einrand was
[47:32] in favor of Laceair. Therefore the Fed
[47:34] is a lace afair institution and should
[47:37] be given and and it doesn't have enough
[47:39] power. That's why we had the crash of08
[47:41] that was you know the bond trader I
[47:43] think is
[47:46] Kaufman he must have lost a lot of money
[47:48] in his bonds there and lost his mind
[47:50] over it right to write something so
[47:52] silly but that's the sort of thing you
[47:54] were reading in the financial press at
[47:55] the time. Well I'm I'm not so sure you
[47:58] could say he lost his mind. I think it's
[48:00] very smart self-interested rationale.
[48:03] You want the central bank to be handing
[48:05] out more money to you. you want to
[48:07] vilify people who say that the central
[48:10] bank doesn't shouldn't be handing out
[48:12] money to you. But of course, as you've
[48:14] written yourself, you know, this is part
[48:15] of very long tradition in the US of uh
[48:18] cronyism and government intervention in
[48:21] uh the economy. Um all right, I want to
[48:24] let's make let's uh shift to more
[48:27] political topics. Um, in general, I
[48:29] guess I I' I'd like to begin by asking
[48:32] you, what are your thoughts on
[48:33] historical revisionism as a term and as
[48:36] a field? Why do you think revisionism is
[48:38] important? Well, all all history that is
[48:41] written is revisionist history. If you
[48:44] look at the academic historians, they
[48:46] they specialize in a certain thing like
[48:48] you're you're the top expert on
[48:50] Alexander Hamilton. If you're an
[48:52] academic, you probably write uh many
[48:55] articles and several books on Hamilton.
[48:58] And why would you write another one?
[48:59] Well, you've you've discovered new
[49:01] things to say about Hamilton. You've
[49:02] revised your earlier writings. And
[49:05] that's what that's what all academic
[49:07] historians do. They they they pick a an
[49:10] area, whether it's a a personality like
[49:12] Hamilton or a a topic, the gold standard
[49:16] or what whatever it might be, and they
[49:18] write article after article, book after
[49:20] book because they revise their thinking.
[49:22] And so but uh uh when you know we're
[49:25] having a conference at the Mises
[49:27] Institute May 15th through 17th called
[49:29] revisionist history of war. And when I
[49:32] wrote the uh the fundraising letter for
[49:34] that I I made the argument that you know
[49:37] everybody knows that uh there's lie
[49:40] after lie after lie has been our history
[49:42] in getting us into wars. And so why
[49:45] wouldn't the state lie about what
[49:47] actually happened during their war at
[49:49] the same time? The history of wars has
[49:51] to be filled with not all lives but
[49:53] certainly a lot. And so we have a a a
[49:56] blockbuster group of speakers coming
[49:58] here at the Mises Institute in a couple
[50:00] of weeks to do that. And so and of
[50:03] course I've you know and of course the
[50:06] state responded to this this whole
[50:08] revisionist thing you know is associated
[50:10] with Holocaust deniers. So they want to
[50:12] think that we're cooks just like the
[50:14] Holocaust deniers if you if you're a
[50:17] revisionist on anything. Uh, but that's
[50:19] that's nonsense because like I said, all
[50:22] history that is written is revisionist
[50:23] history. Why would you write another
[50:24] book on George Washington if you didn't
[50:26] have something new to say about George
[50:28] Washington? Why would a publisher spend
[50:30] the money to publish it if if there was
[50:33] nothing new to say? You could read the
[50:34] old book you can buy on on online for a
[50:38] buck uh if it's just a book on George
[50:40] Washington you wanted.
[50:43] Yeah. Okay. So, uh, what are your let's
[50:46] begin chronologically. What are your
[50:48] thoughts on Hamilton and uh how do you
[50:50] differ from
[50:52] the mainstream interpretation of
[50:54] history? Well, well, I mentioned uh John
[50:56] Steel Gordon. He wrote a book called
[50:58] Hamilton's Blessing. Hamilton once said
[51:00] that a a a national debt could be a
[51:03] public blessing. And the reason he said
[51:04] that is that he he wanted the government
[51:07] to be much bigger than what the
[51:08] Constitution allowed for. He he
[51:10] condemned the Constitution as a frail
[51:12] and worthless fabric when it was
[51:14] ratified because it didn't give the
[51:16] government enough power. And so
[51:18] uh and and so that's that's where he's
[51:21] he stood and and he he's really and John
[51:25] still Gordon praised him for that he
[51:28] Hamilton's blessing. So my book
[51:30] Hamilton's curse is takes the opposite
[51:32] view and Hamilton's reason for that was
[51:35] that the wealthier people of the country
[51:37] would be the ones owning the government
[51:39] bonds if the government accumulated
[51:41] debt. Therefore, they would form a
[51:43] political block in favor of higher taxes
[51:45] to ensure there's always enough money to
[51:47] pay off the interest in principle and
[51:49] interest on their bonds and and you
[51:51] know, bigger government, more money,
[51:53] more taxes. So, he's very
[51:55] malavelium. And the left sort of
[51:58] recently discovered that Hamilton was
[52:00] the real founding father of big
[52:01] government in America. That's why they
[52:03] have this corny play about Hamilton on
[52:06] Broadway that they made all this money
[52:08] for. They they keep writing books that
[52:09] condemn his nemesis Thomas Jefferson and
[52:12] praising Ron Cherno wrote a big
[52:15] giant Pulitzer Prizewinning book on
[52:18] Hamilton and it's all to support his
[52:20] statism. Hamilton was the inventor of
[52:22] the idea of implied powers of the
[52:24] constitution. In his debate with
[52:26] Jefferson over the constitutionality of
[52:29] a national bank, Jefferson said the
[52:33] constitutional convention considered
[52:34] this. They voted it down. Case closed.
[52:37] Hamilton responded by saying, "No, you
[52:39] got to read between the lines. They're
[52:40] implied powers of the government." He
[52:43] was the first to pervert the commerce
[52:45] clause of the constitution to to uh
[52:48] advocate sort of pervasive government
[52:50] regulation of commerce. Uh he was a big
[52:54] taxer. He he he talked George Washington
[52:57] into take in the the drafting 15,000 men
[53:01] to put down the whiskey tax rebellion in
[53:03] Pennsylvania. Hamilton wanted to hang
[53:06] all the tax rebels. George Washington
[53:08] ended up pardoning them all. And he he
[53:12] was the founding father of crony
[53:14] capitalism. He wanted government
[53:16] subsidies for the building of roads and
[53:18] canals even though private enterprise
[53:21] was already busy building roads and
[53:23] canals. He didn't get his way. He was a
[53:26] protectionist on on trade. He was an
[53:29] ignoramis on the economics of trade. He
[53:32] said silly things like anything that is
[53:35] not made grown in America can be
[53:38] imported cuz we can't grow bananas here
[53:41] but everything else we should we should
[53:44] leave out. We should have protectionist
[53:46] tariffs or quotas you know and not have
[53:49] competition from abroad and that that
[53:51] and so he was an economic status through
[53:54] and through. He advocated at the
[53:57] constitutional convention a permanent
[53:59] president which is another word for a
[54:01] king. They had just fought a revolution,
[54:04] a bloody revolution to get rid of a king
[54:06] and he turns around and wants to be a
[54:07] king. And so he basically wanted to
[54:10] bring the rotten British mercantalist
[54:12] system that the revolution was fought
[54:15] against back to America as long as it
[54:18] was controlled by people like himself
[54:20] and his political puppet masters uh in
[54:24] New England and Philadelphia and New
[54:26] York is which is which is what they
[54:29] were. And it reminds it all reminded me
[54:32] of the scene in this old movie uh
[54:35] history of the world part two where Mel
[54:36] Brooks portrays the king of France and
[54:39] his laugh line is to say it's good to be
[54:42] the king. Like someone delivers a pallet
[54:44] of gold bars to him and he looks right
[54:46] into the camera and says it's good to be
[54:48] the king. And that was Hamilton. It's
[54:51] mercantalism is a rotten system if
[54:54] you're on the paying end. But if you're
[54:55] on the money receiving end, it's a
[54:57] pretty good gig.
[54:59] Okay, I'm going to do a little bit of uh
[55:01] revisionism myself here and um challenge
[55:04] one of the uh sacred foundational um
[55:07] beliefs of the US revolution which is
[55:10] yeah I mean sure you could say all kinds
[55:13] of bad things about the British
[55:14] government and the British king but
[55:16] ultimately the British revolution was
[55:18] over 3% tax on tea or 2% tax on tea.
[55:21] Americans today pay something like 50 60
[55:24] 70% of their income in taxes depending
[55:27] on how you calculate it and yeah they
[55:30] get to vote which you know is scant
[55:32] consolation but I think if you told them
[55:34] would you I mean my question for you
[55:37] wouldn't you prefer a king and 3% tax on
[55:39] tea rather than a vote and 70% tax on
[55:42] your income I think it was more than
[55:44] just the taxes there was you know they
[55:47] they cut off trade they they regulated
[55:49] trade they didn't allow the Americans of
[55:51] trade. They had things like since ships
[55:53] were built with they used a lot of
[55:55] pinewood. They they prohibited Americans
[55:58] from chopping down pine trees. They had
[56:01] a police policing it. You soldiers
[56:03] policing it, you know, to find you or
[56:05] put you in jail for cutting down a pine
[56:07] tree and and and a lot of other things
[56:10] like that. It wasn't just the the tax
[56:12] like that. Although I do have a British
[56:14] friend who once said to a group of us
[56:17] Americans at a conference in Cambridge,
[56:20] he said, you know, you you he said, "You
[56:22] Americans uh revolted over taxation
[56:26] without representation." And he said,
[56:28] "How do you like taxation with
[56:29] representation now that you have it?"
[56:32] You know, so your point is well taken on
[56:34] that that that's what it has all evolved
[56:37] to. But who knows what uh it would have
[56:39] evolved to under if we were still
[56:42] British. Look at England today. We
[56:45] England is even worse than we are in
[56:47] America today and we would be just like
[56:49] them. Yeah, fair enough. Fair enough. Um
[56:53] although again you could also say that
[56:55] uh what drove Britain's decline was also
[56:58] a lot of uh taxation and representation.
[57:01] I think the dangerous thing here is once
[57:04] you start giving representation as a
[57:07] function of taxation, then you start
[57:09] making taxation sound like a good thing
[57:12] and people start developing this
[57:13] illusion that the government is out
[57:14] there to help them. The government is
[57:16] their friend and then that just helps
[57:18] the government grow more and more and
[57:19] more. I prefer the honesty of a king
[57:23] because there's a clearer aspect of us
[57:27] versus them. There's the royal family
[57:29] and then there's us plebs.
[57:31] And the I'm not under the delusion that
[57:35] he's taxing me so that he makes my life
[57:37] better. I and so therefore it's
[57:40] difficult for him to impose more and
[57:41] more taxes because people aren't
[57:42] cheering on their own taxation because
[57:44] they're not that they're not conditioned
[57:47] to think of government as we government
[57:49] is another family. You know, you're not
[57:51] part of that family. You're you're not
[57:52] in the royal palace. Yeah. That's them.
[57:55] But when people get the impression that
[57:57] just because you get to th put a piece
[57:59] of paper in a ballot box then government
[58:01] is we then people become a lot more
[58:04] receptive to all kinds of uh uh
[58:07] government positions on life. Oh sure.
[58:09] Yeah. Well, even the study of history
[58:11] when when I wrote so I wrote several
[58:13] books on Lincoln and I I I wrote things
[58:17] uh like
[58:18] about you know the death of at least
[58:22] 50,000 southern civilians, the
[58:24] bombardment of cities occupied only by
[58:27] civilians and the rape, murder and arson
[58:30] of Sherman and other of Lincoln's
[58:32] generals and things like that. People
[58:34] have trouble believing that because they
[58:36] believe, you know, we are the government
[58:37] and and and you know, we were the
[58:40] government in that time, the 1860s, and
[58:42] so how could we do such thing? I, you
[58:44] know, I would never think of, you know,
[58:47] murdering women and children. And so,
[58:50] and and so you get people that have
[58:52] disbelief over the bad things, the evil
[58:54] things the government does because, as
[58:56] you said, American school children are
[58:58] taught from the very beginning that we
[59:00] are the government. That's a big myth.
[59:02] And the the counter to that is what we
[59:04] call libertarian class theory. And
[59:07] Murray Rothbart used to quote John C.
[59:10] Calhoun about this a lot. He wasn't the
[59:13] originator of this. It goes back into
[59:16] European history even later, but Calhoun
[59:19] wrote that in a democracy, you got two
[59:21] two basic classes. The taxpayers versus
[59:24] the net taxpayers who pay more in taxes
[59:28] than they get back from government in
[59:29] benefits. And the net tax consumers who
[59:32] get more from government than they pay
[59:35] in taxes. And that would be the
[59:36] bureaucracy, the politicians, special
[59:39] interest, the welfare warfare state
[59:43] recipients of large s. And Calhoun
[59:46] predicted that the net tax consumers
[59:49] would inevitably overwhelm the net
[59:51] taxpayers in politics so that a paper
[59:54] constitution would be irrelevant. They
[59:57] would they would dream up argument after
[59:59] argument which they have. By the way,
[60:01] it's called the Hamiltonian Constitution
[60:03] in law schools. You know, Hamilton
[60:06] started this sort of clever lawyerly
[60:09] substrifuge of the constitution with
[60:12] this perversion of the commerce clause
[60:13] and and the idea of implied powers. He
[60:17] even had a a theory of subsequent
[60:19] powers. He said, "If the government does
[60:21] something that is
[60:22] unconstitutional, the fact that it did
[60:24] it makes it constitutional." And we've
[60:27] adopted that. Every time we we start
[60:29] bombing another country, it's it's just
[60:32] assumed that it's constitutional because
[60:34] we did it. Even though the Constitution
[60:37] says you have to vote, Congress has to
[60:39] vote for a new war. We start wars all
[60:41] the time. We we started a war in
[60:43] Ukraine. And and there was no vote by
[60:46] Congress to start a war in Ukraine.
[60:48] and the Congress acts as though it is
[60:50] whatever it does there is constitutional
[60:53] because it's doing it and that was that
[60:55] was Hamilton's theory.
[60:59] Yeah. This is yeah this is uh I think
[61:01] very astute. this is the way things go
[61:04] and it's just I think it's just the
[61:06] ultimate contradiction of government
[61:07] which is how can you give consent to
[61:13] somebody to have the uh legitimacy to
[61:16] initiate violence in order to try and
[61:20] limit the ability of people to initiate
[61:22] violence.
[61:24] It's the inherent contradiction of
[61:26] government that can only be resolved by
[61:29] anarchy by people stopping believing in
[61:31] this scam. I guess.
[61:34] Yes, I agree.
[61:37] Okay. Now, moving on to the Civil War.
[61:41] What is uh what is your take on the
[61:43] Civil War and why are you so
[61:44] controversial about it? Yeah. Well, it's
[61:46] hard in a few minutes to to I have
[61:49] written three books on on the subject,
[61:51] but I tell people to be if you want to
[61:53] begin understanding why there was a
[61:54] Civil War, carefully read Abraham
[61:57] Lincoln's first inaugural address. At
[62:00] the beginning of it, I call it his
[62:02] slavery forever speech. In the beginning
[62:04] of it, he starts out saying, "I have no
[62:06] intention to disturb slavery. You can
[62:09] read all my past speeches. I've not
[62:10] changed my mind on this. And besides, it
[62:13] would be unconstitutional for me to do
[62:15] so." And then at the end of the speech,
[62:17] he supports a constitutional amendment
[62:20] that had already passed the House and
[62:21] the Senate and had been ratified by by
[62:25] five states that would have made it uh
[62:29] prohibited the federal government from
[62:30] ever interfering in in slavery. It was
[62:34] called the Corwin Amendment, named after
[62:36] Ohio congressman named Thomas Corwin.
[62:39] But it came from Lincoln. It was
[62:40] Lincoln's amendment. He instructed
[62:43] William Seard before he was inaugurated.
[62:46] He he thought Seward, the New York
[62:47] senator, to get this amendment through
[62:49] the Senate, which he did. And then he
[62:51] lied about it in his first inaugural
[62:53] address. And he says at the end, I
[62:55] haven't seen this amendment. I know
[62:57] nothing about it, but I'm for it. You
[62:59] know, I haven't actually read it, but
[63:01] I'm for it. Imagine that. A lawyer
[63:03] saying, I haven't read this document,
[63:05] but I'm all for it. He says, "I have no
[63:08] no
[63:09] uh problem with making it, in his words,
[63:12] express and irrevocable." That is the
[63:14] the amendment that would have prohibited
[63:16] the government from ever interfering
[63:17] with slavery. So on his day he was
[63:20] inaugurated, he promised the world that
[63:23] he had no intention to disturb slavery.
[63:26] And uh but in the same speech, keep in
[63:29] mind that there was no income tax there.
[63:32] About 90% or more of all federal tax
[63:35] revenue came from tariffs on imports.
[63:37] The average tariff rate was more than
[63:39] doubled two days earlier. More than
[63:41] double the rate of federal taxation. And
[63:44] Lincoln says it's my duty to collect the
[63:47] tariffs. And then he says but beyond
[63:49] that there will be no invasion of any
[63:51] state. And he said he also said there
[63:54] needs to be no invasion or or no
[63:56] bloodshed of any state as long as I can
[63:59] collect the tariffs. So he literally
[64:02] threatened war and bloodshed over tax
[64:04] collection in the same speech that I
[64:07] think is the most powerful defense of
[64:09] slavery ever met meant ever made by an
[64:13] American politician because this was the
[64:15] president on inauguration day and he
[64:18] already had his amendment through the
[64:20] congress and on its way to the states to
[64:23] be ratified that would have made it
[64:25] impossible to do anything about slavery.
[64:27] So if you want to know why there was a
[64:29] war, that's why there was a war. It was
[64:30] over tax collection. And uh and
[64:33] everybody knew it at the time because
[64:34] that's what he said. And in and so in
[64:37] the Emancipation
[64:39] Proclamation that occurred after the
[64:42] Union Army was losing the war after the
[64:44] first two years because of the because
[64:46] of Roberty Lee and Stonewall Jackson and
[64:49] people like that. uh he issued this
[64:53] emancipation proclamation that didn't
[64:54] emancipate anybody because it only
[64:57] applied to rebel territory where no one
[65:00] could emancipate anybody and uh parts of
[65:03] the the America that were under the
[65:06] control of the Union Army were
[65:08] specifically exempted. Uh the entire
[65:10] state of West Virginia was created by
[65:13] the Republican party under Lincoln and
[65:15] it was the last slave state to enter the
[65:17] Union and it entered the Union as a
[65:19] slave state and they kept all the slaves
[65:21] as slaves in West Virginia during the
[65:23] war and the and and they gave the
[65:25] Republican party two more senators and
[65:28] more electoral votes and uh but they
[65:31] didn't free any slaves in West Virginia.
[65:33] and it was specifically exempted in the
[65:34] Emancipation Proclamation as were all
[65:37] the parishes in Louisiana where the
[65:39] Union Army was in control at the time is
[65:42] each one was listed one by one in the
[65:45] right in the document and uh when I
[65:47] visited the Lincoln Presidential Museum
[65:49] in Springfield, Illinois once they had a
[65:52] surprising video they had the face of an
[65:55] ex-slave on a video screen and then his
[65:58] words a voice over with his words saying
[66:01] you I could paraphrase We heard about
[66:03] this emancipation proclamation, but we
[66:06] knew it was false because we weren't
[66:08] emancipated. No, nobody freed us. Yeah,
[66:11] it's 1863. We were still slaves. So, so
[66:15] and so I think the the only possible
[66:18] purpose of that was he thought it might
[66:21] have incited slave rebellions and then
[66:24] the soldiers would have ran home to take
[66:26] care of their families and slave
[66:27] rebellions. Uh but that never happened.
[66:30] did not incite slave rebellions. And the
[66:32] Europeans especially castigated and
[66:35] ridiculed Lincoln for this because they
[66:38] said things like it promises to free
[66:41] slaves where they cannot free slaves,
[66:43] which is exactly what it did.
[66:46] Yeah. I remember things to look at.
[66:49] Yeah. I remember when I uh when I first
[66:50] moved to the US in 2004, I think in one
[66:53] of my first years there maybe in 2005 or
[66:56] so,
[66:58] I was just reading on the internet um
[67:00] something about Lincoln and I came
[67:02] across the Lincoln Douglas debate and I
[67:05] came across some of the expert some
[67:07] excerpts from there and it's actually
[67:10] quite startling how
[67:12] uh very clear Lincoln was about the fact
[67:15] that he's not opposed to slavery and
[67:18] that His problem was essentially a
[67:21] protectionist problem. He was worried
[67:22] about uh he he wanted as he wanted
[67:25] slaves to be sent back to Africa. He
[67:27] didn't want to abolish slavery because
[67:29] he wanted them sent back and he thought
[67:31] the problem was uh slave labor was going
[67:34] to compete with white labor and drive
[67:36] down white wages. Right. Yes. Yeah.
[67:39] whenever he gave a speech about the the
[67:42] Republican party only ever opposed the
[67:45] extension of slavery into the new
[67:47] territories that were that were parts of
[67:49] the United States that were called
[67:51] territories that eventually became
[67:53] state. So you had the Kansas territory
[67:55] or the Oklahoma territory before it was
[67:58] the state of Oklahoma or the state of
[68:00] Kansas. And and they and they said,
[68:03] "Well, we're against that. We're against
[68:04] allowing slaves to be brought there for
[68:06] two reasons. one, they will compete for
[68:10] jobs of free white labor. And that those
[68:12] are the only people who had the right to
[68:14] vote were adult white males. Women
[68:17] didn't have the right to vote at that
[68:18] time and and certainly black people,
[68:20] free or slave, didn't have the right to
[68:22] vote at that time in in American
[68:25] history. And secondly, there was
[68:27] something in the constitution called the
[68:29] three-fifths clause. When when they
[68:31] decide how many members of Congress each
[68:33] state gets, it's based on population. So
[68:36] the bigger the population, the more
[68:38] members of Congress you get in your from
[68:40] your state. And and there was the
[68:42] three-fifths clause said for every five
[68:44] slaves, we will count in the census as
[68:47] three people. And so you would add the
[68:50] number of votes of the Democrat party,
[68:52] if the Democrat party of the which
[68:55] dominated the South brought slaves into
[68:57] the new territories that became states.
[69:00] And so so they gave a political reason
[69:02] and an economic reason but not a moral
[69:04] reason for opposing the extension of
[69:06] slavery but never a southern slavery.
[69:09] The Republican platform of 1860
[69:12] protected southern slavery. This it
[69:14] explicitly says we have no intention of
[69:16] disturbing the domestic institutions of
[69:18] the states which by which they meant
[69:20] slavery. Lincoln was a Hamiltonian on
[69:23] economics. when he first got into
[69:25] politics in
[69:27] 1832, he said, "Here's why I'm in
[69:30] politics. I want a central bank. I want
[69:33] protectionist tariffs and I want
[69:35] internal improvement subsidies, which
[69:38] today we would call corporate welfare."
[69:40] And that's it. That that's it. And he
[69:43] stuck with that his whole career. And
[69:45] that's another reason why I got
[69:46] interested in writing a book on Lincoln.
[69:48] Here's a man who said that those three
[69:51] things, economic polic interventionist
[69:54] economics, was why he got into politics.
[69:57] He spent 25 years fighting for those
[69:59] things. And I'm supposed to believe that
[70:01] that had nothing whatsoever to do with
[70:03] why he was elected president or what
[70:05] he's doing as as president. That's
[70:08] that's what Americans are taught. And it
[70:10] made no sense at all to me and because
[70:12] it is nonsensical. And sure enough, he
[70:14] gets elected president. The first thing,
[70:17] one of the first things he does, the war
[70:19] has already started in June of
[70:22] 1861. He calls Congress back to
[70:25] Washington DC to do what? To get the
[70:27] ball rolling on the Pacific Railway
[70:29] Railway Bill to start subsidizing
[70:32] transcontinental railroads. Lincoln was
[70:35] a railroad attorney. He was a general
[70:37] counsel of the Illinois Central
[70:38] Railroad, one of the biggest
[70:40] corporations on the planet at the time.
[70:42] He rode around the Midwest in a private
[70:44] rail car with an entourage of Illinois
[70:47] central executives. He lived in the
[70:50] biggest house of what's called Old
[70:51] Aristocracy Row in Springfield,
[70:53] Illinois, Illinois uh today. And that's
[70:57] who he was. He was a wealthy railroad
[70:59] lobbyist attorney and that was his
[71:02] priority. He was also a protectionist.
[71:05] So the steel industry especially was was
[71:07] behind him and that's why he signed 10
[71:10] tariff increasing bills as president and
[71:13] the average tariff rate during the
[71:15] Lincoln regime went from a modest
[71:19] 15% 15 to 60% and stayed there for the
[71:23] next 50 years. And so that was the
[71:26] policy of the Republican party
[71:27] protectionism and Lincoln and nothing
[71:30] else. and and of course the the
[71:32] corporate welfare and he didn't get a
[71:35] national bank, but they did have the
[71:37] national currency acts and the legal
[71:38] tender acts that created the greenback
[71:41] dollar as monopoly money. And these
[71:43] these these laws impose taxes on
[71:45] competing currencies and they they tax
[71:48] the competing currencies out of out of
[71:50] business. And like uh one of them was
[71:53] called the Dix, which is 10 in French,
[71:56] Dix. And there was a bank in New Orleans
[71:59] that had a high very high ratio of gold
[72:01] reserves behind the Dicks, the $10
[72:05] currency. And it was very popular and so
[72:08] so widely used that even in the state of
[72:10] Minnesota a thousand miles north of New
[72:13] Orleans it was used as currency because
[72:15] people trusted it. It was backed by
[72:16] gold. And uh and that's where that's
[72:19] where the word Dixie comes from. The
[72:20] merchants would come down the
[72:22] Mississippi River from the upper Midwest
[72:24] and they would sell their wheat or
[72:26] whatever they're selling and they would
[72:28] go home with a pocket full of Dixies,
[72:30] they would say. And so the South became
[72:32] known as the land of Dixie because of
[72:34] his competing currency. But that was
[72:37] that was taxed out of business by
[72:39] Lincoln's national currency acts. And he
[72:42] he didn't get his central bank. He was a
[72:44] life a career-long advocate of bringing
[72:46] back the the Bank of the United States.
[72:49] Americans abolished three central banks.
[72:52] First one was called the Bank of North
[72:54] America. Lasted a year and a half. And
[72:56] it was abolished because it nobody
[72:59] trusted the money. It wasn't backed by
[73:01] anything. Then they had the the Bank of
[73:03] the United States was given a 20-year
[73:05] charter. It it was ended because it
[73:08] corrupted politics, created boom and bus
[73:10] cycles, price
[73:12] inflation. They brought it back to f to
[73:15] monetize the debt for the war of 1812,
[73:18] second bank of the United States.
[73:20] President Andrew Jackson abolished that
[73:23] one by vetoing the recharter because it
[73:26] did the same thing. boom and bust, price
[73:28] inflation, corrupted politics. So, we
[73:31] have in American history, we have three
[73:33] examples of abolishing central banks,
[73:36] and there's no reason why the one we got
[73:38] now can't be abolished or at the very
[73:41] least uh change the law so that they can
[73:43] no longer monetize the debt by buying
[73:46] short-term government bonds. I think
[73:48] Argent, we're working on it. We're
[73:50] working on it with Bitcoin. Yeah, I
[73:51] think Malay and Argentina proposed
[73:54] making it illegal for anyone to to do
[73:57] that. Whether they will do that, who
[73:58] knows? But that's something that can be
[74:00] done. That didn't come along until the
[74:02] 1930s in the US. The Fed was created in
[74:05] 1913, but they changed the law in 19
[74:08] 1930s to allow the government to
[74:10] monetize the debt in that way. And that
[74:13] law can be rescended. You can still keep
[74:15] the Fed, but that would go a great way
[74:17] toward toward taming the Fed.
[74:20] So I was familiar with the uh uh three
[74:23] banks that came after the independence.
[74:26] But you mentioned the first one which is
[74:27] Bank of North America. Bank of North
[74:28] America. You can read them all all about
[74:30] it in Murray Rothbart's history of
[74:33] banking in the United States. It's
[74:35] online on mistas.org on our website. And
[74:39] uh you know the bank of North America
[74:40] was the first one. The second one what
[74:42] year it was?
[74:46] I don't I forget the exact year, but I
[74:48] think 1781 was the first bank of the the
[74:52] United States and this was before that.
[74:55] Yeah.
[74:58] I I thought that was the first one.
[75:01] 1791, I think. Rather
[75:04] 1791. Um Oh, okay. I'll look it up. That
[75:07] was the first one. You read Murray
[75:09] Rothbart's book, The History of Money
[75:11] and Banking in the United States is
[75:12] online on mises.org. You can it's on the
[75:15] just it goes chronologically so you can
[75:17] you can find it very easily. And then
[75:20] the second was bank of the United States
[75:22] which Hamilton championed. Yeah.
[75:25] Jefferson allowed to to I think it was
[75:27] Jefferson who didn't renew its charter.
[75:30] No, the Congress did not renew its
[75:31] charter. Okay. Uh in
[75:34] uh 18 uh that would have been 18
[75:41] uh 1811 I think. Then they brought it
[75:44] back. They created the bank, second Bank
[75:46] of the United States because the War of
[75:47] 1812 came and in 1816 they created
[75:52] what's called the Second Bank of the
[75:54] United States. Then uh and it had a
[75:56] 20-year charter also. So you get to the
[76:00] 1830s and President Andrew Jackson
[76:04] vetoed the recharter. They wanted to
[76:06] give it another 20-year charter and
[76:08] Andrew Jackson vetoed it and the veto
[76:11] was was upheld and so it it eventually
[76:14] over the next several years went out of
[76:16] business. Yeah. So the first one was
[76:18] 1791 to 1811. Yeah. And then the
[76:22] successor was the one that Yeah. The
[76:25] second one was 1816 to 1936.
[76:28] Jackson famously said, "That will kill
[76:30] the bank even if it kills me." And yeah,
[76:33] he he was right on both counts, it
[76:34] seems. Yeah, that was back in the day
[76:36] when u the so-called Supreme Court did
[76:40] not have a monopoly on constitutional
[76:42] interpretation. The chief justice was
[76:44] John Marshall and he he decreed that the
[76:48] Bank of the United States was
[76:50] constitutional even though the
[76:52] Constitutional Convention took an up and
[76:54] down vote and voted down on that on that
[76:57] very thing. But he's a lawyer and so
[77:00] lawyers, you know, specialize in
[77:03] subtrauge with the language and
[77:06] especially government lawyers and
[77:08] especially government lawyers with
[77:09] lifetime tenure. They can say whatever
[77:11] they want and have no repercussion and
[77:14] uh and so he did that and but Andrew
[77:16] Jackson famous basically said thanks for
[77:19] your opinion but I'm the president and
[77:21] my opinion is just as valid as your
[77:23] opinion. I think somewhere along the
[77:25] line he also said I have the I have the
[77:27] army to enforce my opinion. What have
[77:28] you got? And so so back in those days we
[77:32] didn't look at these black robe deities
[77:35] uh in the way we do today. Always you
[77:38] know sitting on the edge of our chairs
[77:40] waiting what what the Supreme Court is
[77:42] going to say about my freedom.
[77:44] And the Jefferson Jeffersonians by the
[77:47] way thought for always said that if the
[77:50] day ever came where everyone's freedom
[77:53] is in the hands of five government
[77:55] lawyers with lifetime tenure, the
[77:57] majority of the Supreme Court, that
[77:59] Americans would live under a tyranny.
[78:02] And that's been true ever since the end
[78:03] of the Civil War. That was not true
[78:06] before the Civil War. We had judicial
[78:09] review, but it was it wasn't the only
[78:11] judicial review. Okay? Congress had an
[78:13] equal say. the president had an equal
[78:15] say and the people of the states were
[78:17] thought to have an equal say on these
[78:18] matters. Yeah, I think there's a general
[78:21] feeling that uh people people look at
[78:24] this and they think, well, it's
[78:24] inefficient. Well, then how is the
[78:26] government going to get anything done?
[78:28] And I think that misses the point that
[78:30] the whole point is for government not to
[78:32] get stuff done. That's the whole point
[78:34] of the Constitution is to make it hard
[78:35] for a government to get things done.
[78:37] Exactly. Exactly. The easier it is for
[78:39] them to get things done, the more
[78:41] catastrophes. James Madison wrote in the
[78:43] famous federalist essay number 10. He he
[78:47] called democracy the violence of
[78:49] faction. We today we would call it
[78:52] special interest politics. And he said
[78:54] the whole purpose of the constitution is
[78:56] to control the violence of faction in
[78:59] the democracy in other words. And that
[79:02] there's always been that tug of war. you
[79:04] know, and and so by by the end of the
[79:07] 19th century though, the the the
[79:10] democracy worshippers got their way.
[79:13] They uh the movement for democracy led
[79:17] to uh the we got the Fed and the income
[79:20] tax in 1913, but also the direct
[79:24] election of United States senators, the
[79:27] 17th amendment to the Constitution.
[79:29] Previous to that, senators were
[79:32] appointed by legislators. So if they
[79:34] said one thing back home in their state,
[79:37] I promised to do this. And then they go
[79:39] to Washington and get bribed by some
[79:42] lobbyist to do the opposite. They could
[79:44] have been fired on the spot by their
[79:45] state legislature. And that happened
[79:48] when Andrew Jackson vetoed the Bank of
[79:51] the United States. There were seven
[79:53] senators who promised to support Andrew
[79:56] Jackson in his battle against the Bank
[79:58] of the United States. They went to
[80:00] Washington and they were bribed with
[80:02] campaign contributions and god knows
[80:05] what else and voted against against
[80:09] Jackson and they were all recalled on
[80:11] the spot and lost their jobs and were
[80:13] replaced by somebody else. But then once
[80:16] we had direct election of senators, then
[80:20] well, if he's in year one and he and he
[80:22] and he votes the opposite of what the
[80:24] people back home send him there for, he
[80:26] has five and a half years to collect
[80:28] campaign contributions from all over the
[80:30] world to to guarantee he's going to be
[80:33] reelected no matter what he votes on.
[80:36] And uh and and that that's what
[80:37] democracy did to uh to representation.
[80:41] It was another willing down
[80:43] of the power of the people to control
[80:46] their own government.
[80:48] Yeah. So um ging back to the civil war
[80:51] in particular, what is your perspective
[80:54] on the issue of slavery and how do you
[80:56] think a free society would have dealt
[80:58] with slavery without the sort of at
[81:01] least uh conventional wisdom idea that
[81:04] Lincoln had to fight a war to stop it?
[81:06] Well, you have to understand that no
[81:09] other country in the world had a war to
[81:11] end slavery. There were slaves than the
[81:13] the British, the French, the Dutch, the
[81:15] Danes, the Swedes, they all had slaves.
[81:18] There were more slaves uh in
[81:21] the in the southern hemisphere than the
[81:23] northern northern hemis than there were
[81:25] in the United States by a large large
[81:28] margin, orders of magnitude as as far as
[81:31] that goes. And there's a book called
[81:34] Greatest Emancipations by uh Jim Powell
[81:38] who cataloges how all the countries of
[81:41] the world ended slavery peacefully
[81:43] including all the northern states. There
[81:45] were slaves in all slaves built the
[81:48] slave ships in New York, Boston and
[81:50] Providence Harbor that went AC sailed to
[81:53] Africa and the coast of Africa. They had
[81:57] house slaves in in the Alexander
[82:00] Hamilton in New York City had house
[82:02] slaves. There were slaves in every
[82:03] state. There were slaves in Illinois,
[82:05] Pennsylvania. They all figured out a way
[82:07] to end slavery peacefully as did all
[82:10] these other countries, the British.
[82:12] There was no war in Great Britain over
[82:14] slavery or or France or Spain or
[82:17] anywhere else. It was only Lincoln, only
[82:20] the Lincoln regime. And of course, only
[82:22] the second half of the war was slavery
[82:25] said to have anything to do with it. And
[82:27] so Lincoln could have done what the
[82:29] British did if he really wanted to end
[82:31] slavery that the British uh bought the
[82:35] slaves from the slave owners and then
[82:37] ended it legally. And that that was the
[82:40] only slavery did not benefit the average
[82:43] hillbilly who was who fought for the
[82:45] Confederate army who did not own slaves.
[82:48] In fact,
[82:49] slavery, as Lincoln
[82:53] understood, slave labor competed with
[82:55] free labor. And the Republican party's
[82:58] position was, "We're against slavery in
[83:00] the territories because we want the
[83:02] votes of free white labor." Lincoln
[83:04] himself even used those exact words. We
[83:07] want the territories to be the exclusive
[83:11] providence of free white labor. That's
[83:13] what Abraham Lincoln said. The same is
[83:15] true in the South. They didn't say that
[83:16] in the south, but it was true that free
[83:20] white labor competed with slave labor.
[83:22] And if you're a yman farmer with a small
[83:24] farm, but no slaves, and you had to
[83:27] compete with the big slave plantation,
[83:29] that was not good for you as a
[83:30] businessman either. And so the vast
[83:33] majority of the Confederate soldiers did
[83:35] not own slaves and they did not they did
[83:38] not think they were fighting for
[83:39] slavery. They would have been a natural
[83:41] political constituency for ending
[83:43] slavery because the whole southerni
[83:45] society was harmed by slavery because
[83:48] slave labor is inherently less efficient
[83:51] than free labor. If you're a slave, you
[83:53] have very little incentive to accumulate
[83:56] skills and and everything because
[83:58] there's nothing in it for you. You don't
[84:00] get paid anymore for for all of that
[84:02] effort you put into into into that or to
[84:06] work hard to work overtime and all and
[84:08] all that. That's why they had to use
[84:09] coercion for slaves. And so he could
[84:14] have done what the British did and what
[84:16] all the rest of the world did. He could
[84:17] have done what Pennsylvania did. In New
[84:19] York, there's there's a book called
[84:21] Slavery in New York. And the New York
[84:24] Historical Society had a big exhibit
[84:26] once and I was there. I went to it
[84:27] called Slavery in New York. There were
[84:29] slaves in New York City until
[84:31] 1853, you know, the eve of the Civil
[84:34] War. And it was only Lincoln that used
[84:37] violence, I think. Why? They they and
[84:39] they got more and more violent as the
[84:41] war went on because they had always
[84:44] waged war on southern civilians from the
[84:46] very beginning. And at that point, tens
[84:49] of thousands of civilians had been
[84:51] killed and there had been massive theft
[84:54] and plundering of southern property by
[84:56] soldiers and hundreds of thousands of
[84:59] soldiers had died or been and even more
[85:02] had been maimed. And so they they
[85:04] couldn't say that this was all about
[85:06] money, which it was. Lincoln said that
[85:08] very clearly in his first inaugural
[85:10] address. So they had to think of
[85:11] something. And also it got more violent
[85:14] because Sherman and Grant and Lincoln
[85:17] knew that they could be hanged if the
[85:19] Confederates won. They could be hanged
[85:21] for war crimes. if the Confederates
[85:23] actually won the war. I even quote a u a
[85:27] Sherman biographer named John
[85:29] Marzlech as saying had the Confederates
[85:31] won, he says they would have been
[85:33] justified in hanging Grant Sherman and
[85:36] Lincoln and the entire Union high
[85:38] command for for waging war crimes which
[85:41] they did against southern
[85:43] civilians during the war. And I think
[85:45] that's why they got even more violent
[85:47] especially against the civilians uh in
[85:50] the last two years of the war because
[85:52] they knew that that that could happen to
[85:54] them if they if they didn't win the war.
[85:58] Excellent. Um yeah and I think in in in
[86:01] my book the uh my book principles of
[86:03] economics I uh I make the case for why I
[86:07] think what really ended slavery all over
[86:09] the world was industrialization by
[86:12] increasing the productivity of workers.
[86:14] it just made it uh not feasible to have
[86:17] slave labor. You don't see industrial
[86:20] slave labor. If it's a factory, then the
[86:23] worker has very high productivity and
[86:25] you need him to pay attention. You need
[86:27] him to not mess up the machine. You need
[86:29] him to be focused and dedicated and that
[86:32] just doesn't work if you're he needs to
[86:34] read. He needs to be able to read
[86:37] as far as that goes. That's why you know
[86:39] the New England and New York New York
[86:40] they ended slavery earlier but the way
[86:43] they usually ended it was in New York
[86:46] for example in the 18 uh oh as long or
[86:50] before the 1800s even they passed a law
[86:54] saying that the children of existing
[86:57] slaves will be free upon reaching age
[87:01] 25. And so you had decades more of
[87:05] slavery even though this law had been
[87:07] passed. And then when the child grew up
[87:10] and was 24, he would be sold into
[87:13] slavery somewhere else in Brazil,
[87:16] southern states. So they they ended
[87:18] slavery, but they did not free very many
[87:20] slaves because they did not want the
[87:22] black slaves living among them in the
[87:25] north. the north. Even Toqueville in his
[87:27] famous book, Democracy in America,
[87:29] published in the
[87:30] 1830s, he said the problem of race, he
[87:34] said, is is uh worse in the north than
[87:38] the South. It was even even worse. And
[87:41] and so the people who ended slavery for
[87:44] economic reasons in the north did not
[87:46] free very many slaves. They ended them
[87:48] ended slavery, but they sold the slaves
[87:50] upon reaching age 23 or 24 or whatever
[87:53] it was. uh and and to somebody else and
[87:56] got rid of them. And uh there's a book
[88:00] by Joanna Pope Melish called Disowning
[88:03] Slavery that's also about
[88:06] this what what happened in the north.
[88:08] And they even dug up black graves
[88:10] because they didn't want black people
[88:12] being buried alongside white people.
[88:14] That was the the the
[88:16] the race situation in the northern
[88:19] states. And I grew up in Pennsylvania
[88:22] and and so this whole idea that
[88:25] northerners were so benited and so
[88:28] humanitarian that they would be willing
[88:30] to die by the hundreds of thousands for
[88:32] black stained strangers in Mississippi.
[88:35] Always struck me as a big pile of
[88:38] horsemen and but that's what every
[88:40] American school child is taught.
[88:43] Yeah, I I find it uh quite uh difficult
[88:47] to believe once you've considered the
[88:48] alternative explanations presented by
[88:50] people like you. It's very obviously not
[88:54] the case. Um um one one issue that keeps
[88:58] coming up now I'm curious about your
[88:59] opinion on this. A lot of people say uh
[89:02] Donald Trump's tariffs are a great idea
[89:04] because in the 19th century the US
[89:06] became a superpower and got really rich
[89:08] because of tariffs. How do you answer
[89:10] that? Well, that was the industrial
[89:12] revolution. We've talked about the
[89:13] robber barons and the and all that. I
[89:16] think they have the causation
[89:19] backwards. We industrialized and became
[89:22] prosperous. And then we adopted tariffs
[89:24] because a few bureaucrats wanted to be
[89:27] protected from competition as far as
[89:29] that goes. That started during the civil
[89:32] war, by the way. And foreign trade was a
[89:35] small percentage of GDP all throughout
[89:37] that time. So it couldn't have been the
[89:40] driving force. The driving force was
[89:42] free market entrepreneurship by people
[89:45] like James J. Hill and Ron John D.
[89:47] Rockefeller. And and a lot of the
[89:49] tariffs have always been on inputs into
[89:52] the production process. It it it's it's
[89:55] just laughable that President Trump
[89:57] today, for example, wants higher tariffs
[90:00] on steel and aluminum and then at the
[90:03] same time he has auto workers all
[90:05] cheering him. Yeah. He's but it's going
[90:08] to make the production of American cars
[90:11] more expensive. You know, make American
[90:13] cars less competitive on international
[90:15] markets if the cost of their steel and
[90:17] aluminum goes up. And that was true in
[90:20] spades. Like I'll give you one example.
[90:21] The McKinley tariff of
[90:24] 1890. Uh William McKinley, who later
[90:27] became president, was a member of
[90:28] Congress at the time. He's Trump's hero.
[90:31] President Trump has made speeches
[90:32] praising McKinley. He wants to be like
[90:35] McKinley. McKinley was also an
[90:37] imperialist who who launched I think
[90:39] seven or eight invasions of Dominican
[90:41] Republic and Haiti and Mexico several
[90:45] times a big imperialist as well. But he
[90:49] he they put his name on this tariff even
[90:51] though uh because he was the most rabid
[90:54] protectionist in Congress at the time,
[90:57] 1890. And it was such a bad idea and it
[91:02] increased the price of things that were
[91:04] used very widely by Americans that the
[91:07] Republican party which had control the
[91:09] House of Representatives was kicked out.
[91:12] They had a 3 to1 minority. They they
[91:15] were in the minority. Democrats had a 3
[91:18] to1 majority and McKinley himself was
[91:20] voted out of office and because the
[91:23] people were so harmed at the time tin
[91:25] plate was used to manufacture a lot of a
[91:27] lot of things and so there's a big
[91:29] increase in the price of tin and so a
[91:31] lot of common household products that
[91:34] were made of
[91:35] tin skyrocketed in price and that's just
[91:38] one thing there were dozens of other
[91:40] things and people equated those price
[91:43] increases with McKinley and the
[91:45] Republicans
[91:46] and it almost totally destroyed the
[91:48] Republican party. And so, as I said, a
[91:51] lot of the inputs, it made it made
[91:53] America less competitive. If you if you
[91:56] want your industry to be strong, you
[91:58] want it to be comp subjected to
[92:00] competition. If you want it to become
[92:03] fat and lazy and uncompetitive like the
[92:05] American car companies were in the
[92:07] 1970s, then protect them from
[92:10] competition like they were in the 1960s
[92:13] uh and in the 1950s with tariffs and and
[92:16] and quotas and things like that.
[92:20] Yeah. And I think um I I think what's
[92:23] also missed here as as you said the uh
[92:26] the size of foreign trade was a very
[92:28] much smaller part of the economy. And I
[92:31] think what's missed here is that the US
[92:32] itself was always one giant free trade
[92:35] zone where people could trade within
[92:37] that zone without any tariffs. And I
[92:39] think this is arguably one of the most
[92:42] important reasons for the US's economic
[92:44] development. It had always been the
[92:46] world's largest free market. Maybe until
[92:48] recently China now is possibly bigger by
[92:50] some metrics, but it was always the
[92:52] largest market. You've got 50 states and
[92:54] you can if you can make one thing in one
[92:57] of those states, then you can sell it in
[92:58] all 50 states. It's a huge geographic
[93:01] area with a lot of production. So to
[93:04] credit the tariffs on the foreign goods
[93:06] which was a small part of the economy I
[93:09] think is wrong. But I think the other
[93:11] aspect of it is that even if the tariffs
[93:13] were high the total burden on the
[93:16] citizens of tariffs and taxes and
[93:18] inflation was a lot lower than it is
[93:20] today. Oh sure. Key point. Well, sure
[93:24] that today uh I think I used to look up
[93:26] once in a while
[93:28] uh uh national income get get you know
[93:31] the government statistics on national
[93:33] income and then get the government
[93:35] statistics on all taxes federal, state
[93:37] and local and divide the two taxes
[93:40] divided by national income and and you
[93:42] would usually get 33% 35 38%. And then
[93:47] if you consider that regulation is an
[93:49] implicit tax because it pushes up the
[93:51] price of whatever is being
[93:53] regulated then you can easily say that
[93:56] we pay at least 50% of everybody's
[93:59] income in tax. Uh the national taxpayers
[94:02] union every day celebrates tax freedom
[94:04] day. It's usually right around now. It's
[94:06] usually like April 15th is tax day, but
[94:10] it's also a tax freedom day because they
[94:12] they get this number taxes divided by
[94:14] income and say the average American
[94:16] works for about three and a half months
[94:18] out of every year just to pay taxes. And
[94:21] uh that's sort of deceiving because the
[94:24] top 50% of income earners, which is only
[94:28] adjusted gross income of about 50,000 a
[94:30] year or more, pay 98% of all taxes. the
[94:34] bottom 50% pay almost no income tax and
[94:37] so you've got that top 50% paying
[94:40] everything and u and that's sort of
[94:42] Calhoun John Calhoun would be a uh that'
[94:47] be a nightmare to him because you talk
[94:49] about the tax the net taxpayers or this
[94:53] upper group the net tax consumer is the
[94:55] is half the country now more than half
[94:58] the country.
[95:00] Yeah. Okay.
[95:02] Um generally what uh what thinkers
[95:05] outside of the Austrian school would you
[95:07] recommend for people interested in
[95:09] learning more about um uh history and
[95:12] economics in general? What are some of
[95:14] the important scholars other than you
[95:16] know Rothbart Mises Hayek and the ones
[95:18] that we're very familiar with? Well, I
[95:19] mentioned another friend of ours Ralph
[95:21] Reiko. He's a historian who just
[95:24] published a book of his essays on the
[95:27] history of liberty. He wrote his
[95:29] doctoral dissertation under Friedrich
[95:30] Hayek at the University of Chicago on on
[95:33] the history of liberty in Europe, the
[95:35] European tradition. And he and we took
[95:38] all his speeches, his videos of
[95:41] speeches, and had them transcribed into
[95:43] this new book that we just published a
[95:46] couple of weeks ago. He also published a
[95:48] book called The World at War. And of
[95:51] course, the I'm an economist. I you
[95:53] know, I read a lot of the Chicago school
[95:55] economist economists over the years. I
[95:58] got interested in economics by Milton
[96:00] Freriedman when I was a college student.
[96:03] Read his popular writings. James
[96:05] Buchanan was a professor of mine in
[96:07] graduate school. He won the Nobel Prize
[96:09] in economics for in basically creating
[96:12] the public choice school of economics
[96:14] which is a the economic analysis of
[96:17] political decisionmaking. There's a big
[96:20] literature on the economics of
[96:21] bureaucracy there. Uh, another historian
[96:24] that is one of my favorites is Clyde
[96:26] Wilson. He's an American history. He was
[96:29] taught history at the University of
[96:30] South Carolina for many years. He's one
[96:33] of the most learned uh men I've known in
[96:36] my I knew in my 41-year career as an
[96:39] academic and and I always read anything
[96:41] I see I find by Clyde Wilson. That's
[96:44] another another person that I whose work
[96:46] I value out there and um the whole uh
[96:51] decision the whole literature on
[96:53] decentralization you know we tend to
[96:55] think especially in America uh left and
[96:58] right either uh either Mille is going to
[97:00] be the president of Argentina or another
[97:02] socialist peronis is going to be the
[97:04] president of Argentina but you can also
[97:06] think vertically about politics how to
[97:08] decentralize power so it doesn't matter
[97:10] as much who the president is you
[97:14] It might matter more who the county
[97:15] sheriff is. And my friends at the
[97:18] Abyville Institute in uh have written
[97:22] for 20 years now a lot of great articles
[97:24] and books on this the whole idea of
[97:28] federalism and states rights and the
[97:30] Swiss and the Americans uh are famous
[97:34] for the system of federalism. I think
[97:36] the Swiss have kept the roots of their
[97:38] federalism more than Americans have.
[97:41] We've destroyed most of it in this
[97:42] country and the Swiss are on their way
[97:44] to destroy destroying their their system
[97:46] of federalism. I think hopefully they'll
[97:49] they'll reverse it. But the Abbyville
[97:51] Institute tries to keep that tradition
[97:54] alive and there's a lot of great
[97:55] literature on the sort of that
[97:58] Jeffersonian decentralist tradition in
[98:01] American political thought and if you
[98:03] pro peruse their website you get a lot
[98:05] of great literature.
[98:08] Excellent. Well, now let good transition
[98:11] to talking about my favorite website,
[98:13] mises.org and the Mises Institute in
[98:15] general. So, you've been president of
[98:17] the Mises Institute now for I think a
[98:19] couple of years, right? About a year and
[98:20] a half. Yeah. Year and a half. Yeah.
[98:22] Yeah. So, um what's new in the Misa
[98:24] Institute and what are your plans for
[98:26] the future and what is your vision for
[98:28] what you want to achieve? Well, we want
[98:30] to keep uh keep promoting the the
[98:33] Measian and Rothbartian tradition of
[98:35] scholarship. We have a uh our next
[98:39] conference is on uh uh revisionist
[98:41] history of war. That's May 15 through
[98:43] 17. Next year uh would have been Murray
[98:47] Rothbar's 100th birthday. So it's going
[98:50] to be the year of Rothbart at the Mises
[98:52] Institute. Our our big May conference
[98:54] which we have every year on some topic
[98:56] will be on the Rothbartian tradition of
[98:59] liberty and economics and uh and we
[99:02] haven't worked out the speakers and and
[99:04] things like that but it'll be a
[99:06] conference and a book just like our
[99:09] revisionist history of war conference.
[99:11] We will produce a book by all the all
[99:13] the speakers at that conference. And so
[99:16] those are a couple of the things that
[99:18] we're doing at the Mesa Institute. We
[99:20] produced a video called Playing with
[99:22] Fire about the Fed and it came out in
[99:26] October and we now have as of yesterday
[99:29] about
[99:30] 920,000 views on YouTube of our or 38
[99:34] minute documentary about the Fed. And
[99:37] the the title came from Jim Grant. He
[99:39] said, he said, "The Fed is like an
[99:41] arsonist who who starts a fire and then
[99:44] once the fire is raging, he changes
[99:46] clothes into a firefighter's outfit and
[99:49] tries to put out the fire by putting
[99:50] more gasoline on it." And that's why the
[99:53] Playing with Fire is the main title of
[99:56] our documentary. And uh we we have new
[99:59] podcasts um to reach the younger people
[100:02] primarily at the Mees Institute. Check
[100:04] out our insight our website. We still
[100:07] have books like Man Economy and State by
[100:09] Mary Rothbart that are downloaded off
[100:11] our site 30 to 40,000 times a month
[100:15] every month year in and year out along
[100:17] with human action by Ludvig Vameis 30 40
[100:20] 50,000 downloads a month every month.
[100:23] And so you can get a great free
[100:24] education on on our website and and we
[100:27] work very hard at it and we have about 5
[100:29] million unique viewers every year of our
[100:32] of our of misus.org.
[100:34] Yeah, I cannot thank you and the
[100:37] institute enough. It was it was
[100:40] absolutely monumental for my
[100:43] intellectual journey and for my life in
[100:44] general. I came across a website I think
[100:46] in 2007 for the first time and just
[100:49] finding all these books and digging in
[100:52] and reading was just absolutely amazing.
[100:54] It's incredible that you put all of this
[100:56] material out there for free. It makes it
[100:58] great for uh anybody to get access to
[101:01] this incredible Yes. We we had a donor
[101:04] that gave us enough money to give away a
[101:06] 100,000 copies of Murray Rothbart's
[101:08] book, What Has Government Done to Our
[101:10] Money? And and we still have a few left.
[101:12] So, if any of your viewers would like a
[101:15] free copy of What Has Government Done to
[101:16] Our Money? They can get on our website
[101:18] and and sign up. We also gave away a
[101:21] 100,000 copies of Economics in One
[101:23] Lesson by Henry Hlett. And then a
[101:26] different donor saw this and gave us
[101:29] enough money, we just put together a new
[101:30] book of essays by Friedrich Hayek called
[101:33] Hayek. We're calling it Hayek for the
[101:35] 21st century, Essays in Political
[101:38] Economy. And uh in in about a month,
[101:40] you'll be able to get on misus.org and
[101:42] get your free copy of that book also.
[101:45] Fantastic.
[101:47] Excellent. Um anything else you want to
[101:50] share with us about the institute or
[101:52] your own work? Uh any new updates?
[101:55] uh new updates. No, just I think I
[101:57] encourage everybody to get our free
[101:58] books and uh and and educate themselves.
[102:02] Uh don't you don't need a degree in
[102:04] economics to understand economics. And
[102:07] we have uh Mises University is our our
[102:10] sort of main program. We have we usually
[102:12] get about 120 college students from all
[102:14] over the world every summer come to
[102:16] Alabama in July to listen to economics
[102:19] lectures for no college credit. And
[102:22] these are very unique young people and
[102:24] they're very motivated and uh and we're
[102:27] capitalists. And so we have a an
[102:29] optional contest at the end and an an
[102:32] exam and a first place winner gets
[102:35] $2,500, the second place $1,500, the
[102:38] third place 500. And it's very
[102:40] competitive. And some years we'll get a
[102:43] a brilliant high school student who will
[102:45] win the first prize or second prize.
[102:47] even though he or she is competing
[102:49] against PhD students, we always have
[102:51] mostly undergraduates with some PhD
[102:54] students and we get two or three or four
[102:56] very bright high school students every
[102:59] year also. And so if you have any young
[103:02] people who are interested in in in
[103:03] learning about free market Austrian
[103:05] school economics, send them to our Mises
[103:08] University.
[103:10] Yeah. And uh moving on to um current
[103:13] affairs, u do you have thoughts on um
[103:17] current economic policy? What are your
[103:19] thoughts on Trump's tariffs for
[103:21] instance? Well, I think Trump has made a
[103:22] big mess of things. He's he's increased
[103:24] our average tariff rate from 2 and a
[103:26] half% to about tenfold if he goes
[103:29] through with with what he's promising.
[103:32] We shall see. It was kind of disturbing
[103:34] to me that the head of the European
[103:36] Union said, "Okay, Mr. Trump, we will go
[103:38] to zero tariffs if you go to zero
[103:40] tariffs. And he didn't respond. He
[103:42] didn't get back to them. And and so that
[103:45] told me that he doesn't want zero
[103:47] tariffs. And he he had he had a choice.
[103:50] He he wants to be the great
[103:52] negotiator. I think he's barking up the
[103:54] wrong tree. I think we've had we've had
[103:58] situations like South Korea for two
[104:01] years ago had zero tariffs on American
[104:03] imports and we still had a trade deficit
[104:05] with South Korea. And Trump is basing
[104:08] this whole thing on trade deficits which
[104:10] he blames on his predecessors who are
[104:12] bad negotiators because he of course is
[104:15] the best negotiator in all in all time
[104:18] according to him and that's his theory.
[104:21] But it doesn't make sense in that
[104:23] regard. Even Mexico, not too long ago,
[104:25] Mexico had no tariffs on American
[104:27] imports, but we had a trade deficit with
[104:30] Mexico. And Trump thinks it's because we
[104:32] are bad
[104:33] negotiators. But that that has to be
[104:35] untrue in light of those facts. And so
[104:39] that's why I said he's barking up the
[104:40] wrong tree. It's based on a false notion
[104:43] that about what causes trade deficits.
[104:47] American companies are uncompetitive
[104:49] with a lot of these countries. Our wages
[104:52] are maybe 10 times higher than some of
[104:54] these other countries. And I think
[104:56] that's a more important thing because
[104:58] our technology does not produce enough
[105:00] productivity to justify a 10-fold
[105:03] increase in wages over Mexico or whoever
[105:06] we're trading with.
[105:08] Yeah, I think the um yeah, the key
[105:12] problem here as as you said, you know,
[105:14] some countries already had 0% tariffs
[105:16] and so this idea that this is some
[105:19] genius 4D chess move to try and get uh
[105:23] to try and get all these other countries
[105:25] to drop tariffs doesn't make sense
[105:26] because some countries had already
[105:27] offered to drop tariffs and yes, they
[105:30] were rebuffed and some countries already
[105:32] had zero tariffs. So, I think it really
[105:35] is true. As ridiculous as it sounds, he
[105:37] genuinely does believe that a trade
[105:40] deficit with any country means that that
[105:42] country is stealing from you and that if
[105:46] and that that's yeah that's because
[105:49] Biden was a bad negotiator and all the
[105:50] previous presidents were bad negotiators
[105:53] and that what they need is just uh some
[105:55] real estate magnate from New York who
[105:57] knows how to negotiate to twist these
[105:59] countries arms and then suddenly the US
[106:01] will have a trade surplus with all of
[106:02] them. But of course, the insane thing
[106:04] here is that the reason the US can run
[106:06] all of its trade deficits is because of
[106:08] its money printer. And that's the whole
[106:10] point of having a money printer. If you
[106:12] don't want the trade deficit, just get
[106:13] rid of the money printer and then you
[106:15] won't be able to spend more than you
[106:16] earn. Yeah. Well, that that's why if you
[106:18] compare American wages to some of the
[106:21] other countries wages and we ours might
[106:23] be five or six, seven times higher. was
[106:26] because all the fed money printing and
[106:28] create all the price inflation and the
[106:30] workers get the cost of living raises
[106:33] which doesn't benefit them because
[106:34] everything they buy costs more too but
[106:37] it creates this situation where the you
[106:39] might be paying $39 an hour in the
[106:42] United States and $6 an hour
[106:45] in South Korea let's say in a particular
[106:49] industry and that makes it hard to
[106:51] compete but the Fed is behind the
[106:54] creation of that situation.
[106:58] Absolutely. And uh what are your
[107:00] thoughts on current US foreign policy?
[107:02] And do you think the US is being led to
[107:03] another war?
[107:05] Well, they're trying. Uh they're trying.
[107:07] You know, as there's a news report last
[107:10] week that the Secretary of Defense
[107:13] Hseth talked Trump out of bombing Iran.
[107:17] And then immediately the next day
[107:20] there's all over the new the internet
[107:22] here in the United States that there's
[107:24] that there's a a crusade to get rid of
[107:27] HEG as Secretary of Defense. And so u so
[107:31] yeah we're we're we're now at war with
[107:34] uh with Israel against all whoever
[107:37] Israel wants to be in war with
[107:38] apparently includes Syria now. And we're
[107:41] at war with Russia now because we are
[107:44] supplying arms to uh to Ukraine have
[107:48] been and and people we we can't be
[107:51] sending them all this military
[107:52] technology without also sending the
[107:54] people who know how to use the
[107:55] technology. And uh and so we've been
[107:57] doing that. Uh and Trump promised to be
[108:03] anti-war, but the first thing he
[108:05] promises is to send more armaments to
[108:07] Ukraine and Israel. And so he's pro-war
[108:10] and it's very dangerous and uh he wants
[108:14] to brag that he can
[108:16] negotiate peace in the entire planet,
[108:18] but at the same time he's sending more
[108:20] bombs and more fighter jets to foreign
[108:22] countries to to murder more foreigners
[108:26] who who uh never threatened Americans
[108:28] with with anything.
[108:31] Yeah, it's absolutely amazing just how
[108:35] um how enthusiastic he's been about all
[108:37] these wars even in spite of all the
[108:39] rhetoric about him being a peace
[108:41] president and him not wanting to launch
[108:43] wars but um things have been progressing
[108:46] in that way and then the aggressive way
[108:48] in which he's been supporting Israel's
[108:49] genocide has just been incredible.
[108:52] Um the US the US stands to gain
[108:55] absolutely nothing from that. They they
[108:57] have no interest in that part of the
[108:58] world whatsoever. Yeah, that's true.
[109:01] Well, a a wealthy Las Vegas casino owner
[109:05] gave him a hund00 million for his
[109:07] campaign and so he owes her big time and
[109:12] that that's what that's what he's doing.
[109:15] Yeah. And um perhaps uh uh related to
[109:20] that, Walter Block was recently uh um
[109:24] expelled and removed from the Misa
[109:27] Institute because of that. Um do you
[109:29] have any thoughts on this and uh why you
[109:33] as the institute felt the need to do
[109:34] this? He's no longer an unpaid senior
[109:37] fellow. He wasn't expelled, you know,
[109:39] but he's no longer an unpaid senior
[109:41] fellow because he's he's writing
[109:44] articles advocating the dropping of
[109:46] nuclear bombs on Muslim countries and
[109:50] mass murdering women, children, and
[109:51] babies in Gaza and cheerleading for it.
[109:55] Very enthusiastic cheerleading.
[109:57] Castigating American taxpayers at being
[110:00] too stingy and not sending enough bombs
[110:02] to Israel, things like that. And we told
[110:05] him is th this is is inherently
[110:08] incompatible with our mission at the
[110:10] Mises Institute. And he's no one is
[110:13] stopping him from writing as much as he
[110:15] wants to write, but we can't be
[110:18] associated with someone who basically uh
[110:21] is a cheerleader for genocide. He's been
[110:25] bugging me to hold a debate on the topic
[110:28] genocide good or bad. And I keep telling
[110:31] him and some of his friends that only a
[110:34] nut would think it's a legitimate
[110:37] debate. Genocide good or bad. And uh and
[110:41] and so if he wants to be make himself
[110:42] out as a nut, good luck with that,
[110:44] Walter Walter Blanc. And that's that's
[110:47] all I'm going to say about that. Yeah. I
[110:50] uh you know before the current war a
[110:52] couple years ago I had the debate with
[110:53] him. A couple of uh friends organized a
[110:56] debate where we discussed uh the history
[110:58] of the Israeli Palestinian conflict and
[111:01] uh that was a perhaps a transformative
[111:03] moment for me in my understanding for
[111:05] the conflict because I thought Walter
[111:08] Block would be able to present the
[111:09] Steelman case for Israel and Zionism.
[111:13] And I was absolutely amazed at just how
[111:16] completely and utterly vacuous and
[111:18] childish and moronic uh his arguments
[111:21] were and that they basically boil down
[111:25] to nothing more than I don't want to
[111:29] recognize that Palestinians can have
[111:31] property rights in the land of Israel
[111:34] because all of their property rights are
[111:36] invalid and therefore anything they do
[111:38] to defend their property rights is a
[111:41] criminal act and then anything that the
[111:42] Israeli government does in return is
[111:45] justified and it's just a completely um
[111:49] completely incompatible way of thinking
[111:51] to anything that any Austrian would
[111:53] think about. But really, when it comes
[111:55] to this topic, it's fair to say that
[111:58] he's just he just becomes a lunatic, a
[112:00] bloodthirsty monster. It's a he's
[112:03] incapable. Yeah. He he's incapable of
[112:06] understanding the idea. I mean, I was I
[112:07] was telling him, okay, what can somebody
[112:09] like me do? I was born not Jewish on
[112:12] that land and my ancestors had lived
[112:14] there for centuries. So, what can I do?
[112:17] And he has absolutely no answer for it.
[112:19] It's just leave or die or just Israel
[112:22] needs to do what it does. And it's it's
[112:25] incredible. He conflates Muslims with
[112:28] Arabs. He thinks it's the same thing.
[112:32] There no there are no Christian Arabs
[112:34] and no no nothing else. And so he he
[112:36] right. He doesn't know what he's talking
[112:38] about. And uh and yeah, he's he'd become
[112:41] a bloodthirsty monster like you say. And
[112:45] so what else can you say about it?
[112:47] That's that's what I I wrote him a
[112:48] letter when he said, "You can't you
[112:50] can't be a senior fellow of the Reese's
[112:51] Institute anymore if you if you're going
[112:53] to write things like this. It's
[112:55] fundamentally incompatible with what we
[112:57] believe in and what what our our mission
[113:00] statement says, you know, end of story."
[113:03] And we could go on and on about it.
[113:05] That's why one of the speakers, by the
[113:06] way, in our revisionist history of the
[113:09] war is going to be um Elana Mercer,
[113:11] who's a great friend of mine, and she's
[113:13] the the daughter of an Israeli rabbi and
[113:16] born and raised in Israel. But there's
[113:18] no sharper critic of the genocide going
[113:21] on there than Alana Mercer. And we're
[113:24] also having a survivor of the Israeli
[113:29] attack on the USS Liberty in 1967 to
[113:33] tell the story of what happened there.
[113:36] He's he's the president of the USS
[113:38] Liberty Veterans
[113:40] Association. And so, so we will kind of
[113:42] touch on this general topic in our our
[113:46] our conference. Yeah, that's a pretty
[113:49] important one. It's amazing how little
[113:51] anybody talks about it. I mean, it's uh
[113:53] it's sort of like it's a century after
[113:55] the Civil War, but uh there's a lot more
[113:58] evidence than there are survivors, and
[114:00] yet people just don't even mention it in
[114:03] mainstream American discourse. It's
[114:04] really remarkable. Yeah. It's one of
[114:07] those things you're not supposed to talk
[114:08] about. Exactly. Which is what the Misa
[114:11] Institute specializes in, which is why
[114:12] we love you guys. Yeah. So, we we we
[114:15] don't take any prisoners. We don't
[114:17] compromise. Uh that's that was the
[114:19] spirit of Murray Rothbart. That's why
[114:21] Murray uh he should have had an endowed
[114:23] chair at an Ivy League school his entire
[114:25] career. He was that brilliant. But of
[114:27] course, people like us don't get jobs
[114:29] like that. No, absolutely. And I think
[114:31] you look at the kind of people who have
[114:32] endowed chairs in u Ivy League
[114:35] universities. I don't think any of them
[114:36] has produced any book that can compare
[114:39] to any book written by Marty Rothbart.
[114:41] Yeah. Yeah. How many of them do you
[114:43] think 50 years
[114:46] after you know more? Well, Murray died
[114:48] in 95. So, uh, 30 years after their
[114:52] death, there's 40,000 downloads a month
[114:55] of one of their books. Um, none of them,
[114:59] not one. I don't think any of them would
[115:01] get 40,000 downloads. Or Alan Greenspan,
[115:04] how many how many people are downloading
[115:06] his his ranting and ravings in anything
[115:09] he has ever written, even though he was
[115:12] climbing to the the heights of his
[115:14] profession, chairman of the Fed. Yeah.
[115:16] This was you know before the internet or
[115:18] in the early days of the internet this
[115:19] was a common refrain amongst mainstream
[115:21] economists which is well the Austrians
[115:24] don't matter because all the important
[115:25] jobs are held by the Keynesians and so
[115:28] the Austrians don't matter but you think
[115:30] about people like Paul Samuels and all
[115:32] of these most important mainstream
[115:34] economists even people like Thomas
[115:36] Freriedman uh sorry Milton Friedman
[115:38] rarely anybody reads their actual work
[115:40] today I mean Freriedman is more famous
[115:41] today because of his propaganda his
[115:43] movies which are actually pretty good
[115:45] but his scholar ship. I mean, who
[115:47] downloads the his history of the United
[115:50] monetary history of the United States
[115:51] that he wrote? Who actually reads that?
[115:53] He won a Nobel he won a Nobel Prize for
[115:56] the theory of a consumption function and
[115:59] nobody reads that. Yeah, absolutely. And
[116:02] and yet Rothbart's books, Mises's books,
[116:04] they get downloaded in the tens of
[116:06] thousands as you said. Yeah. You
[116:08] probably heard of the story of the UFC
[116:10] fighter Ronaldo Marano. Yes. Brazilian.
[116:13] And uh at the end of his fight, he grabs
[116:15] a microphone from Joe Rogan in front of
[116:18] 15,000 people and and and shouts out,
[116:21] "If you love your country, you will read
[116:22] Ludic Von Mises." Yes. So, yeah.
[116:26] Absolutely. We we we immediately sent
[116:28] him a big box of books and invited him
[116:30] to speak at Mises University. And we
[116:33] have a t-shirt made with that saying on
[116:35] the back in his likeness on the back of
[116:38] a t-shirt in our bookstore. Excellent.
[116:41] Which reminds me, my old collection of
[116:43] Mises Institute t-shirts is all worn out
[116:45] now. I need to go shopping and get my
[116:48] new kit of we have some new new
[116:51] additions to the line. So, you can go
[116:53] you can go online and order order some
[116:54] new ones. Yes, I highly recommend and
[116:57] endorse Visa Institute merchandise,
[116:59] beautiful t-shirts, and high quality
[117:00] stuff.
[117:03] Okay. Well, thank you for that. Thank
[117:05] you. Thank you so much for this. I
[117:06] really enjoyed the conversation and
[117:08] thank you so much for everything you do
[117:09] at the Misa Institute and for all of
[117:10] your scholarship. Okay, my pleasure. It
[117:13] was a great fun to be with you and uh
[117:16] keep up the great work. Thank you very
[117:18] much. Have a good day. You too.
