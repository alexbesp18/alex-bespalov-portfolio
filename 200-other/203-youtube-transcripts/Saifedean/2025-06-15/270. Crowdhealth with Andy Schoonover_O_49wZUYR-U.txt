[00:05] Hello, welcome to the Bitcoin standard
[00:06] podcast. Our guest today is Andy
[00:08] Skunover. Andy is the is the CEO and
[00:12] founder of Crowd Health, an alternative
[00:14] to health insurance, which is a great
[00:18] idea that I have enjoyed and we've
[00:21] hosted Andy before. discussed it and I
[00:23] think it's a great great way to get
[00:26] around some of the many many failures of
[00:28] the modern health care system. He joins
[00:30] us today to discuss how this company's
[00:32] been doing. Today is their fourth
[00:34] birthday. They've been around for four
[00:36] years. They've been doing really well.
[00:38] They use Bitcoin and they are very much
[00:40] Bitcoiners in their approach to this and
[00:43] it's been working out very well. So
[00:44] Andy, thank you so much for joining us.
[00:46] Always an honor, safe, appreciate it.
[00:49] Thanks man. So, happy fourth birthday.
[00:53] Yeah, thanks. It's been uh been a a wild
[00:56] ride. You know, we started back in April
[00:58] of uh of 21. And you know, anytime you
[01:01] start a new business, you've got this
[01:03] kind of forecast of what you what you
[01:05] expect. Um and you know, thank God it's
[01:09] gone actually much much better than I
[01:10] had expected. So, um it's been a a lot
[01:13] of fun. I've gotten to engage with lots
[01:15] of Bitcoiners to help you know, develop
[01:17] our strategy. And so um you know here's
[01:20] to another you know four years and 40
[01:24] four is too little we got to think a
[01:25] long time 400 even. There you go. All
[01:30] right. So for people who are not
[01:31] familiar can you just give us a brief
[01:33] overview of what it is that you guys do
[01:34] and what the model is. Yeah I'll start
[01:38] quick with a quick background. Um this
[01:41] is my my second healthcare company and
[01:43] after the first one um given that most
[01:45] of us in the United States get our
[01:47] health insurance uh through our employer
[01:49] I I sold that one so I didn't have
[01:51] health insurance and so um ignorantly I
[01:54] thought my only option was to go to one
[01:56] of these affordable care Care Act plans
[01:58] you know the Obamacare plans and uh you
[02:01] know so I I went and did that and it was
[02:03] I think 11 or 1200 bucks for me my wife
[02:05] and my two girls and I kind of joke it
[02:07] worked until I had to use it. Um, my
[02:09] little one, who was one at the time, was
[02:12] having recurring ear infections. And so
[02:14] we went to the pediatrician who said she
[02:15] she's got a hole in her eard drum. So
[02:17] the the the fluid in her ears were
[02:20] getting so bad that actually popped her
[02:21] eard drum. And so we needed to get
[02:24] little tubes, little plastic tubes in
[02:25] her ear so that that fluid could drain
[02:27] out so she wouldn't have a problem. So
[02:29] went to the ear, nose, throat doctor,
[02:31] uh, got that done in network, did
[02:33] everything right, got the bill, and it
[02:35] was $8,000. I was like, "Holy crap,
[02:38] $8,000 for 15 minutes." Um, but I, you
[02:41] know, assumed that's what health
[02:42] insurance is for. Like, that's the whole
[02:44] point of having health insurance. And
[02:46] little did I know, I was going to get a
[02:47] note a few weeks later from my health
[02:49] insurance company who said it was
[02:50] medically unnecessary. And so, uh, they
[02:52] declined to pay for the bill. Um, and
[02:55] after two rounds of appeals, I think my
[02:57] ear, nose, and throat doctor was
[02:58] fighting with like an opthalmologist or
[03:00] something at the health plan who knows
[03:02] nothing about ears, and they were like,
[03:04] "Yeah, we're not paying for So, I had a
[03:06] stroke $8,000 check to get this
[03:07] procedure paid for. And it was at that
[03:09] point where I knew that health insurance
[03:11] was broken. So, I called my health
[03:13] insurance plan. I was like, I'm done.
[03:15] I'm if you're not going to pay my bills,
[03:16] I'm not going to pay your bills. And I
[03:18] became uninsured. And, you know, my wife
[03:20] looked at me was like, so we're
[03:22] uninsured. What do we do now? You know,
[03:24] a little bit nervous, obviously. And
[03:26] then over the next 12 to 18 months, I
[03:28] figured out how we could operate outside
[03:31] of the legacy health insurance space. um
[03:35] to pay for bills ourselves, to take true
[03:37] sovereignty over our own health care.
[03:40] And I realized that we could negotiate
[03:42] bills much much lower if we were to pay
[03:44] them directly without all the you know
[03:47] rent seeking middlemen that are are in
[03:50] healthcare currently. Um and I finally
[03:54] kind of decided like I bet you other
[03:55] people would be interested in something
[03:56] like this too. And so I started Crowd
[03:58] Health. Um, we've been at this for 4
[04:00] years and in essence, what we're trying
[04:02] to do is decentralize the decision-m
[04:05] processes of of healthcare. So, we've
[04:08] got currently 10,000 people um you
[04:11] included um who are members of our of
[04:13] our community um and you know about 20%
[04:16] of those are Bitcoiners. So, we got a
[04:18] couple thousand Bitcoiners who are part
[04:19] of that. And in essence, what we do is
[04:21] we help each other with our health care
[04:23] bills. So, you know, if my daughter
[04:25] breaks her arm and it's $5,000, we'll
[04:28] send um a request to a 100 people or few
[04:31] people in the community for a h 100red
[04:33] bucks, they if they say yes, then
[04:35] they'll transfer 100 bucks from my
[04:37] account or their account to my account.
[04:39] At the end of the day, I have $5,000
[04:41] which I can then go and pay the doctor
[04:44] directly. Um, and the benefits of this
[04:47] is now there's no insurance company or
[04:50] employer or government in between me and
[04:52] my doctor because I'm paying him or her
[04:54] directly. Um, as a result of that, they
[04:58] don't have all that bureaucracy in that
[04:59] administration. So, they can give me a
[05:01] much much better price. So, the average
[05:05] is about 30 to 40% of your revenue as a
[05:08] doctor is used to actually get paid.
[05:12] um they spend two days a week fighting
[05:14] with health insurance plans to get paid.
[05:16] And so um if I can give that time back
[05:19] to them, they can give me a much reduced
[05:22] price. And so that's in essence what
[05:24] we're doing is is getting rid of all the
[05:26] rent seeeking middlemen and and going
[05:28] directly to the doctor, which
[05:30] reestablishes that doctor patient
[05:31] relationship. And now the decisions on
[05:34] what care I get is between me and my
[05:36] doctor without anybody else having any
[05:38] input into into that decision-making
[05:40] process. So, it's a it's a it's a
[05:42] beautiful thing and um you know, we're
[05:44] we're slowly but surely introducing
[05:46] Bitcoin into that equation and in hopes
[05:48] of ultimately getting to Bitcoin
[05:50] circularity within healthcare. So,
[05:52] that's our ultimate goal, our ultimate
[05:53] vision for the company. Yeah. And I
[05:56] think it's such a wonderful idea because
[05:58] even before I had heard about this, I'd
[05:59] always um heard of just how ridiculous
[06:02] the insurance industry is in the US.
[06:04] It's um I mean it's it's got its
[06:08] problems abroad, but I think in the US
[06:10] it's a whole other level of dysfunction.
[06:14] And I've heard this story from so many
[06:15] people that um you can actually end up
[06:19] getting a lower price if you just pay
[06:22] cash than what you would pay as a uh as
[06:26] a deductible when you're covered from
[06:28] insurance. And it sounds crazy because
[06:31] you pay an exorbitant sum of money every
[06:33] month to be insured and then all that
[06:36] does for you is that it 5xes or 10xes
[06:39] your bill when you go to the hospital
[06:41] because now you're insured. And so now
[06:42] the hospital is having to deal with the
[06:44] insurance company and now all the
[06:45] incentives are for them to jack up the
[06:47] price. Whereas if you just go to them
[06:49] directly and tell them, "Hey, I'd like
[06:50] to just pay in cash." they'll be so
[06:53] happy to take it that they they'll offer
[06:56] you a better price than what the
[06:57] insurance company's going to force you
[06:58] to pay. Yeah. You know, it's it's
[07:01] interesting to me that um me as an
[07:04] individual, I can actually negotiate a
[07:06] better price with my doctor or the
[07:08] hospital or whoever it may be than
[07:11] United Healthcare, which is the seventh
[07:13] largest company on the planet in terms
[07:14] of revenue. Um, you know, I think they
[07:17] have $425 billion of revenue every year,
[07:20] uh, which is about half of what the
[07:23] military-industrial complex, uh, you
[07:25] know, costs the United States. So, one
[07:27] company is about half of what our
[07:29] military budget is. Um, that says a lot
[07:32] about the company and our military
[07:33] budget, I think. But, yeah, I mean, you
[07:36] have more um power to negotiate than
[07:39] than United Healthcare, which is a
[07:41] pretty amazing thing from my
[07:43] perspective. It kind of defies economics
[07:45] a little bit. You think more purchasing
[07:47] power, a lot more strength in
[07:50] negotiation, but what we have is a
[07:52] principal agent problem where our agent
[07:56] is actually, you know, who's supposed to
[07:57] go out there and try to find us the best
[07:59] deals um actually is incentivized to see
[08:02] prices go up over time. And so, you
[08:06] know, if if which totally destroys
[08:08] against that that principal agent
[08:10] relationship and people don't understand
[08:12] that, but in the United States, health
[08:14] insurance plans are capped out at the
[08:17] amount of profit that they can have. So,
[08:19] if I've got $1,000 of premiums, they're
[08:22] capped out at 150 bucks. So, everybody
[08:25] thinks that's like from the outside
[08:26] looking in, that's great. Health
[08:28] insurance companies shouldn't fleece us.
[08:30] But the problem with that is that now
[08:33] health insurance companies, how do they
[08:34] grow their revenue or their profit 10%
[08:37] from $150 to
[08:39] $165? Well, your premium, what you pay
[08:41] them every month, has to go up from
[08:44] $1,000 to $1,100. So, the buyers of
[08:49] healthare, these big health insurance
[08:51] plans, and the sellers, they they want
[08:53] the price to go up. The sellers of
[08:55] healthcare, these big hospital systems,
[08:57] they want the price to go up. And so,
[08:59] you know, you don't need to be, you
[09:00] know, safety to understand if the buyer
[09:02] and the seller of something wants the
[09:04] price to go up, guess what? The price is
[09:06] going up. And so, that's why we have,
[09:09] you know, egregious prices within the
[09:10] United States is because you got the
[09:12] buyer and the seller of the the the
[09:14] service both wanting the price to go up.
[09:18] Yeah. And I think a lot more doctors are
[09:20] beginning to discover this and realizing
[09:22] that they can just opt out of the entire
[09:24] system and deal with the patients
[09:25] directly and it works out better for the
[09:27] doctors and the patients. So we've had
[09:30] Dr. Mary Bowen on and uh she's pretty
[09:33] amazing. I she's done incredible work on
[09:35] COVID and curing people and getting
[09:38] people access to ivormectin and she runs
[09:41] her clinic now just on this model where
[09:43] she doesn't deal with any of that stuff
[09:45] as far as I could tell and it's worked
[09:48] out much better for her and I've also
[09:49] heard about the Oklahoma Surgery Center
[09:51] who have been doing this for years and
[09:53] it was truly mind-blowing when I first
[09:55] heard about them because you go onto
[09:57] their website and you find the procedure
[10:00] that you want. Let's say you want a hip
[10:01] replacement or you want a um
[10:04] appendecttomy or whatever and they'll
[10:06] have it listed and they'll have the
[10:08] exact price for you of how much you're
[10:10] going to be paying. It's amazing. It's
[10:11] like you're actually just buying a
[10:13] service and then you pay for it. And you
[10:16] know, it sounds weird for most people to
[10:18] think of it this way because we don't
[10:20] think of healthcare as if it is a an
[10:24] economic good. It has this special
[10:27] romantic feeling where no no no no it
[10:28] can't just have a price on it. You can't
[10:31] just, you know, say $12,000 for a hip
[10:34] replacement. It's it's supposed to be
[10:36] about health. It's supposed to not have
[10:38] a bill. And so trying to not let it have
[10:41] a bill ends up giving us all kinds of
[10:44] exorbitant bills where yeah, you're not
[10:47] getting the bill up front telling you
[10:49] you're paying $12,000. You're being
[10:50] told, "Oh, don't worry. You've got
[10:52] insurance. You've got coverage." But
[10:54] then after you go and get the procedure
[10:56] done, then the bills keep coming in and
[10:59] then you have to play the uh the the
[11:03] roulette game of will they pay or won't
[11:05] they pay and how are we going to
[11:08] convince them to pay and what excuses
[11:09] are they going to use to not pay.
[11:13] Yeah, exactly. And everything else in
[11:14] life, we know exactly what the price is
[11:16] except healthcare. And so there is and
[11:19] in in in many ways we are as individuals
[11:23] through health insurance not
[11:25] incentivized at all to look for the
[11:27] price. You know, if my deductible is
[11:30] $2,000 and I need a replace knee
[11:32] replacement that's
[11:34] $20,000, I could care less what the
[11:37] price is cuz all the excess price is
[11:40] being paid by somebody else as opposed
[11:43] to us, right? And so, um, you know,
[11:46] there's there's just no market forces
[11:48] within healthcare that that that have a
[11:51] a that drive prices down. Um, in
[11:54] essence, all the market forces are
[11:55] pushing prices up. And so, that's the
[11:58] challenge that we have in in healthcare
[11:59] is nobody's incentivized to to really
[12:02] care. even if we had the prices. I'm
[12:04] going to I'm doing a an op-ed in a a
[12:08] fairly well-known um you know
[12:10] publication about how price
[12:13] transparency sounds great, but if people
[12:16] don't care what the prices are, then
[12:18] price transparency is pretty useless. Um
[12:22] you know, so you know it we have a
[12:24] totally screwed up system here and and
[12:26] it's a lot of these these these, you
[12:28] know, issues that we're talking about is
[12:30] what we're trying to solve here at Crowd
[12:31] Health. And like I said, our members are
[12:33] getting half the price of what United
[12:35] Healthcare pays. So if you actually go
[12:37] out and and shop for services, and that
[12:40] sounds so foreign to people, but if you
[12:42] shop for services, you can find services
[12:44] that are significantly better than what
[12:47] your health insurance plan pays. And my
[12:48] one example that I just gave you, $8,000
[12:51] for these ear tubes, I had people reach
[12:54] out to me on X and say, "Oh yeah, we do
[12:56] these in our office for like $1,500 to
[12:58] $2,000 all day long if people pay us
[13:00] cash." So, I could have saved 75%. If I
[13:03] had just known that, you know, the these
[13:06] the other there are other options out
[13:08] there, but I'm so limited by the network
[13:10] in which the health insurance plan
[13:12] requires me to go to that I don't even
[13:15] have the option to go to anybody else
[13:17] because I I don't get credit for that
[13:19] and the insurance plan won't pay for
[13:20] that. So these um these rules that have
[13:25] been put in place around these networks
[13:27] are actually inflating prices when they
[13:28] were you know supposed to reduce prices
[13:30] by using the power of the negotiation to
[13:33] get these doctors to reduce their
[13:34] prices. It just doesn't happen that way.
[13:36] In theory it sounds great and and
[13:39] practically it doesn't work at all. The

[14:44] brought to you by the Daylight Computer.
[14:45] I love to work early in the morning and
[14:47] late at night or in the sun outdoors,
[14:49] but regular computer screens are
[14:51] terrible at these times, and they strain
[14:53] your eyes. For years, I've wanted a
[14:55] paper-like electronic screen on a simple
[14:57] computer I could use to write. I tried
[14:59] several models, but none were very good.
[15:02] Now, finally, Daylight have delivered a
[15:05] fantastic full function tablet with a
[15:07] paper-like screen that's easy on your
[15:09] eyes and great for outdoor use. I've
[15:12] been using the daylight computer to
[15:13] write my next book and it is absolutely
[15:16] fantastic and it has led me to invest in
[15:18] this company myself. Check out my
[15:20] interview with Andran Kata in episode
[15:23] 249. Now tell us about why you guys are
[15:26] using Bitcoin and how you're using
[15:27] Bitcoin and how that's been going.
[15:31] Yeah. You know, I I had a really
[15:32] interesting meeting soon after I started
[15:34] Crowdalth with Jimmy Song. I know you
[15:36] know Jimmy well. Most of the people here
[15:38] listening are are talking about Jimmy. I
[15:40] was telling him what I was doing and
[15:41] he's like, "Man, you know, the problem
[15:42] with health insurance is that they have
[15:44] this huge pool of fiat sitting in the
[15:47] background um that they have to have to
[15:50] pay for these big bills. But
[15:52] unfortunately, this big pool of fiat, as
[15:54] we all know, is melting um with
[15:56] inflation and therefore it needs to be
[15:59] replaced every year and therefore it
[16:00] drives costs up." said, "You know what?
[16:03] If you could just allow people to to
[16:05] hold their their their dollars in
[16:08] Bitcoin as opposed to having this big
[16:10] pool of fiat on the on the back end."
[16:12] And it got me thinking about how do we
[16:15] incorporate Bitcoin more into into what
[16:17] we do. You know, in essence, my my end
[16:20] goal here, and there's a couple stages
[16:22] to get there, but my end goal is for,
[16:26] you know, total Bitcoin circularity
[16:28] within within healthcare. So, you know,
[16:30] instead of me sending um the community,
[16:33] you know, 500 or $5,000 in the previous
[16:35] example um and then then send me
[16:38] dollars, why not them send me Bitcoin,
[16:41] which I can then go and pay the hospital
[16:43] system in Bitcoin or the doctor in
[16:45] Bitcoin, so that there's like a a true
[16:47] Bitcoin circularity within healthcare.
[16:50] And and my theory here is, you know,
[16:53] healthcare within the United States is a
[16:55] $5 trillion industry. You know, if it
[16:57] was a if it was a country, that would be
[16:59] the fourth largest country after the
[17:01] United States, China, and Japan. And so,
[17:04] if we can get Bitcoin circularity
[17:05] working within um healthcare in the
[17:07] United States, I think that will go a
[17:09] long way of getting, you know, Bitcoin
[17:10] circularity in other kind of facets of
[17:13] life. And uh healthcare expenses are
[17:16] typically Americans, you know, number
[17:19] one or number two, you know, line item
[17:21] in their budget of, you know, just
[17:23] getting their their health care paid
[17:24] for. So that's that's our ultimate
[17:26] vision. Um you know we've we've got to
[17:29] get scale to get there. So if people are
[17:31] listening to this and and um you know
[17:33] are interested in in an alternative to
[17:35] healthcare, we'd love to have you
[17:36] because we need you know five or 10
[17:38] thousand people that want to use Bitcoin
[17:41] to actually have the scale to go and do
[17:43] this. Um we are building a group of
[17:47] doctors who are accepting Bitcoin. We
[17:50] are orange pilling doctors so that they
[17:52] will accept Bitcoin. I just talked to
[17:54] one of the largest hospital systems in
[17:56] the country who is now evaluating taking
[18:00] Bitcoin as a payment method as opposed
[18:03] to um dollars. And that's a pretty big
[18:06] thing because hospitals are very slow
[18:07] movers in terms of of innovation. And so
[18:10] if we can create that Bitcoin
[18:12] circularity within healthcare, I think
[18:13] that just goes a long long way. But like
[18:16] I said, we there's a couple steps to get
[18:17] there. Um, you know, right now what we
[18:20] enable people to do is one component of
[18:23] our system is that we ask you to help
[18:25] fund another person in the community
[18:28] directly every month and we ask for an
[18:30] individual up to $140 to fund that
[18:33] individual. Right now we're only so for
[18:36] example in in April we only asked for 80
[18:39] of that $140. So if you are a bitcoiner,
[18:42] we can actually take that
[18:44] excess60 that will go directly to fold
[18:47] at your fold app, convert it to bitcoin.
[18:50] So in essence, what you have is almost
[18:52] like a little bitcoin HSA. Um so instead
[18:55] of it's sitting in a big pool of fiat
[18:57] like health insurance, you hold it in
[18:59] your own account. Um it's it's
[19:02] increasing with value as opposed to
[19:04] melting away. And so that's step one of
[19:06] enabling our our members to utilize
[19:08] Bitcoin for their their healthcare in a
[19:10] more effective manner. You know, step
[19:12] two hopefully will be this Bitcoin
[19:13] circularity that I've been talking
[19:14] about. But we need some scale to be able
[19:16] to do that. Yeah. But I on the step one,
[19:20] I think things have been working out
[19:21] really well. So you you said you took
[19:23] you started off in April. So, you know,
[19:25] by the time most people started uh
[19:27] contributing, putting money in that was
[19:30] going into Bitcoin, that was probably by
[19:31] late uh by early 2022 when there was a
[19:35] pretty significant bare market. So, I
[19:37] presume most of your clients got in a
[19:39] lot of their Bitcoin in the doldrums of
[19:43] 2022 bare market. And so, the timing was
[19:47] good. Yeah, the timing was good because
[19:49] now it's up four 5x. So if you had kept
[19:52] that in dollars or if you had put it in
[19:53] an investment portfolio, it would have
[19:56] made a lot less uh in terms of
[19:59] appreciation. So now everybody's a lot
[20:01] better off, right? Because they've used
[20:02] Bitcoin, the magic superpower of number
[20:04] go up technology.
[20:06] Exactly. And I and I still think the
[20:08] timing is good. So you know, for for
[20:10] those who are like, I'm too late, I I
[20:12] think the timing is still really really
[20:13] good. And in fact, you know, 80% of my
[20:16] liquid assets are in in in Bitcoin. And
[20:19] um so I think I think the timing is
[20:20] still good. So every dollar you're
[20:22] putting into the into Bitcoin, I think
[20:23] it's going to be worth many many
[20:25] multiples of that over the coming years.
[20:27] So I think it's a smart way to stack
[20:29] sats. Um it's kind of an automated way
[20:31] to stack sats every single month and you
[20:34] know get your health care paid for at
[20:35] the same time. So it's you know two
[20:37] birds with one stone. And so that's our
[20:39] our kind of entry point into you know
[20:42] getting Bitcoin involved. Um, you know,
[20:44] and I think the other part part of this
[20:46] too that people don't really think
[20:47] about, um, although I know you talked
[20:49] about in your books is that, you know,
[20:51] we've got a group of people in crowd
[20:54] health who are all really focused on
[20:55] taking care of themselves. You know,
[20:57] like I said, many of them are
[20:58] Bitcoiners. Um, none of them are obese,
[21:01] none of them smoke. And so, we've got a
[21:03] group of people who take care of
[21:04] themselves. So instead of you having to
[21:06] pay out, you know, thousands of dollars
[21:08] a month oftent times to pay for people
[21:11] who aren't taking care of themselves,
[21:13] you're paying directly to other people
[21:15] who are taking care of themselves. And
[21:17] in fact, we actually give a discount to
[21:19] Crowd Health for people who have, you
[21:21] know, low fasting insulin levels, who
[21:23] have low visceral fat levels. And so
[21:25] we're actually incentivizing our members
[21:28] to get healthy. and we're incentivizing
[21:30] people who are healthy to join Crowd
[21:32] Health so we can build this community of
[21:34] people who don't have to subsidize kind
[21:37] of the the fiat, you know, health
[21:39] lifestyle. Um, and as a result of that,
[21:42] we've got much much lower bills than you
[21:44] would with your traditional health care
[21:46] plans. I mean, it's probably 50 or 60%
[21:48] less, in some cases 75 or 80% less than
[21:51] what you're currently paying with your
[21:53] your healthare. Plus, you're not paying
[21:55] for any of this other garbage that
[21:57] people are paying for. Like, most people
[22:00] don't really understand, but most health
[22:01] insurance plans in the United States pay
[22:04] for, you know, gender reassignment and
[22:06] some of this other stuff that you're
[22:08] just kind of like, I don't want to be
[22:09] paying for that stuff. Um, so you won't
[22:11] be paying for that stuff when you're
[22:13] you're a member of of Crowd Health.
[22:16] Yeah. And it's a huge thing. And I think
[22:17] it's it's illegal for insurance
[22:19] companies to uh um test people's health
[22:23] and give them different rates based on
[22:24] their health. Right. Yeah. Which is
[22:26] ridiculous. And that's Mario Rothbart
[22:29] said this a long time ago and you know
[22:30] he's been dead for 30 years now, 31
[22:32] years I think. And he said this is non
[22:34] insurance. This is uh this is a form of
[22:37] subsidy from the healthy to the
[22:39] unhealthy. If insurance companies are
[22:41] not allowed to effectively discriminate
[22:44] based on your health status, then that's
[22:45] not insurance.
[22:47] It's, you know, the point of insurance
[22:49] is the idea that you're trying to uh
[22:53] protect people from risks, but there
[22:56] there are different layers of risk.
[22:58] There are different levels of risk. And
[22:59] so, if your house is in a hurricane, you
[23:01] should be paying a higher insurance
[23:02] premium than somebody uh or if if your
[23:05] house is in a hurricane zone, then
[23:07] you're likely going to be paying a
[23:08] higher insurance rate. But you can't do
[23:12] that with health. And so you take away
[23:14] from insurance companies the incentive
[23:15] to make their customers healthy. You
[23:18] take away from the customers the
[23:19] incentive to be healthy. And I think the
[23:21] really dangerous thing about it is that
[23:23] you see this quite often. A lot of
[23:26] people are just so
[23:28] uh amazed by the miracles of modern
[23:31] medicine. They keep hearing about all
[23:32] these incredible press releases. Harvard
[23:35] University announced that they are going
[23:37] to do this or that one day or the other
[23:39] or breakthrough that's going to fix
[23:41] cancer. And so for most people, because
[23:43] of all of the hype and uh propaganda
[23:46] surrounding modern medicine, for most
[23:48] people, they think by the time I'm going
[23:50] to need modern medicine, particularly
[23:51] young people, by the time I'm going to
[23:53] get really sick, modern medicine is
[23:54] going to have figured it out. And I
[23:56] remember hearing several people, you say
[23:58] this as a joke, that, you know, by the
[24:00] time that I get sick, if modern medicine
[24:03] hasn't figured out a cure for cancer,
[24:04] then maybe I don't want to live anyway.
[24:08] Uh but it's a horrible horrible
[24:09] mentality obviously because the I think
[24:13] the dangerous thing about it is just
[24:14] that this idea that medicine is just a
[24:16] magical cure for anything that you can
[24:19] always just find a pill that will fix
[24:21] things and it's very dangerous because
[24:24] people shouldn't be thinking of health
[24:25] in that way. I think the correct way of
[24:27] thinking of health is that it is
[24:29] something that is precious and you must
[24:32] preserve and if you lose it you may
[24:34] never get it back. you shouldn't think
[24:36] of it as being something that can be
[24:37] fixed with a pill. You should think of
[24:39] it as being something that can not be
[24:41] returned. And for me, this idea that,
[24:44] you know, well, maybe science is going
[24:46] to find a cure for this or that disease.
[24:49] It's like saying that, well, I hope one
[24:52] day Apple is going to invent a laptop
[24:54] that you can throw from the 20th story
[24:56] window and that it'll continue to work.
[24:59] And you know, they could they could
[25:00] invent a laptop that would survive a 20s
[25:02] story fall, but it's much better that
[25:05] they just invent a laptop that can
[25:07] survive that fall and you just don't
[25:09] throw your laptop from 20 floors because
[25:12] that's going to mean a lot better
[25:14] laptops. It makes a lot more sense. And
[25:17] similarly, you know, the way to fix your
[25:19] health is not to wait for modern
[25:22] medicine to find the pill for whatever
[25:24] ails you. It's to sort out the cause of
[25:27] whatever it is that ails you and then
[25:29] stop that. But unfortunately, insurance
[25:31] is massively counterproductive to this.
[25:33] It just gives people the impression that
[25:35] you can get away with with whatever you
[25:36] want.
[25:38] Yeah. I mean, and I've kind of said it
[25:40] before, but it's healthcare is more
[25:42] welfare than it is healthcare. Um, you
[25:45] know, we're subsidizing all the people
[25:47] who are taking that risk that some magic
[25:50] pill is going to happen. And I like like
[25:53] you said would prefer to to be in
[25:55] community with people who are taking
[25:57] this seriously now and not waiting for
[25:59] the magic pill you know in 10 or 20
[26:01] years. And so you know we're already
[26:03] seeing that right now with with GLP1s.
[26:06] Um you know now I can um you know eat
[26:10] whatever I want and if I get overweight
[26:12] then I have a pill to fix it. And so
[26:14] again Crowd Health is not paying for
[26:16] GLP1s. We are not a a high time
[26:20] preference type of organization. We're a
[26:22] low time preference organization and we
[26:24] want we want groups of people who are
[26:26] low time preference and so you know if
[26:28] you want GLP1s or the magic pill or
[26:30] whatever it may be um then we're not the
[26:33] right right community for you. Um so you
[26:36] know and like you said every other type
[26:38] of insurance you actually get risk
[26:40] adjusted based upon behavior or location
[26:43] or whatever. And in the United States, I
[26:46] don't know if it's the same way where
[26:47] you are, but we can actually plug
[26:49] something into our car and it can tell
[26:51] you like how good of a driver you are
[26:53] and you actually get a rate based upon
[26:56] if you're a good driver versus a bad
[26:58] driver. And so, you know, you can't do
[27:00] that with health care in kind of your
[27:02] traditional health insurance system. And
[27:04] that's a tragedy from my my perspective
[27:07] because it gives people very little
[27:08] incentive to actually improve their
[27:11] their health. Um, and so, you know,
[27:14] we're trying to change that with Crowd
[27:16] Health. Given we're not insurance, we
[27:18] can do that. Um, and and we think it's
[27:20] been, you know, pretty effective. And in
[27:22] fact, we've had people who were
[27:24] overweight and tried to be members of
[27:26] Crowd Health and we said, "Hey, you're
[27:28] you're, you know, overweight." And they
[27:30] came back to us like six months later
[27:32] and they had dropped the weight. They
[27:35] had they he sent me a picture of him and
[27:37] his wife who were running a triathlon.
[27:39] Um, and he's like, "It was my motivation
[27:42] to get healthy due to crowd being
[27:44] wanting to be a member of Crowd Health,
[27:46] um, that changed my life." And I'm like,
[27:49] "Thank God." Like, that's that's what we
[27:51] want. We want people to be incentivized
[27:52] to change their health. And, um, so far
[27:55] we're being pretty effective in doing
[27:56] that.
[27:58] Yeah. Exactly. I think this is the thing
[28:00] that people just miss is
[28:02] there's you have so much control over
[28:04] your health and people just um aren't
[28:07] aware of that. Part of it is because of
[28:09] the idea that insurance is there. Part
[28:11] of it is just the status mentality that
[28:13] the government is mommy, government is
[28:15] daddy, government can take care of me
[28:16] and you know I pay my taxes so it's
[28:19] their job to make sure that I get
[28:21] healthcare. It's their job to make sure
[28:22] that I don't get sick. And then I think
[28:24] the big part is just that people don't
[28:27] understand the connection between food
[28:28] and health. I think the vast majority of
[28:30] people think food is just uh
[28:34] entertainment and it's something that
[28:36] you have to do because everybody does it
[28:38] and all right, you need it because you
[28:40] need energy. Obviously, they get cranky
[28:42] uh when they're not getting their carbs.
[28:44] So, they realize they need it, but they
[28:46] don't really understand that there is a
[28:48] connection, a very direct connection
[28:49] between it and uh your health. And for
[28:51] many of those people, it's not easy for
[28:54] them to ever even make an attempt to try
[28:56] and uh get on uh a diet that drastically
[29:01] changes their health. And they'll just
[29:04] always continue to try and have the same
[29:07] food all the time. And so they don't see
[29:09] the connection between their food and
[29:10] their health because it's just the same
[29:12] food. You'd need to really make a
[29:15] significant change in your diet in order
[29:17] to be able to notice significant changes
[29:20] in your health. But once you do, you'll
[29:22] be shocked. And I know this because I
[29:23] was one of those people. And I was
[29:25] shocked as soon as I started reducing
[29:27] the amount of processed carbs that I had
[29:29] initially. As soon as I stopped drinking
[29:31] soda and just eating the most egregious
[29:34] junk, just you know, the lowhanging
[29:37] fruits of it, immediately I felt like a
[29:39] new human being. And it was incredible.
[29:40] I could run much faster. I lost a lot of
[29:43] excess fat. I felt a lot better.
[29:46] Everything just gets a lot better when
[29:48] you do that. And most people just are
[29:50] not aware of it. And with insurance, it
[29:53] doesn't give them the incentive to even
[29:54] think about it.
[29:56] Yeah. I mean, we we we think food is a
[29:58] big component of this because I think
[29:59] there's kind of two things that need to
[30:01] change to to get our healthcare prices
[30:04] down. One is the price, you know, just
[30:06] the price per procedure, but the other
[30:09] is consumption. Um, and because we are
[30:12] an obese country, we have very high
[30:14] consumption of of healthcare in general.
[30:17] And in fact, we're more obese in the
[30:19] United States that we're 50% more obese
[30:21] than the o other OECD countries. And so
[30:24] if you think about that that you know
[30:26] folks who are obese are five to 10 times
[30:29] consume five to 10 times the amount of
[30:31] healthcare as someone is as normal
[30:33] weight. And so there's just, you know,
[30:36] we we actually sent out hundreds of
[30:38] copies of uh of Fiat food to our members
[30:41] in hopes that they would pay attention
[30:43] and change their their lifestyle habits
[30:45] for those who aren't eating eating, you
[30:48] know, meattheavy meat dense types of of
[30:51] diets and are gorging on carbohydrates.
[30:54] So we think and we've actually heard
[30:56] feedback that, you know, your and Matt's
[30:58] book on fiat food has actually changed
[31:00] people's lifestyle habits. And so we do
[31:03] things like that within Crowd Health
[31:04] too. We we give people free books to be
[31:06] like, "Hey, go change your lifestyle
[31:08] because that's going to be a key
[31:09] component of reducing, you know,
[31:11] healthcare costs." You know, the other
[31:13] thing we do too is we have like
[31:14] quarterly specials. So um the first
[31:17] quarter we had a DEXA scan. So you can
[31:20] go get a DEXA scan. It's fully fundable
[31:22] by the community so that you can
[31:24] understand what your muscle mass is. You
[31:25] can understand what your visceral fat
[31:27] is. So people can start understanding
[31:29] how your body operates to um improve
[31:32] their healthcare. We're doing gut health
[31:35] this this month or this quarter. Um
[31:38] we're doing a V2 max in the third
[31:40] quarter and we're doing fasting insulin
[31:43] uh in in Q4. So we're trying to get
[31:46] people to understand what are the main
[31:49] drivers of good health. How do you
[31:51] measure those things? um because it's
[31:54] you know what whatever you measure is
[31:55] going to be the things that improve that
[31:57] you're really paying attention to. So
[31:59] those are big um kind of focus for us uh
[32:02] over the next year at at crowd. Yeah.
[32:05] And I think fasting insulin is a huge
[32:07] one. It's so important and it's
[32:10] remarkable how little attention is being
[32:11] paid to it. I mean people spend so much
[32:13] time stressing over their cholesterol
[32:15] level which arguably is largely noise.
[32:19] And we've done an episode on this
[32:21] podcast with Dr. Dr. Malcolm Kendrick. I
[32:25] urge you to look into it. If you have
[32:26] ever been concerned about your
[32:28] cholesterol, if you've had a doctor tell
[32:30] you about your cholesterol, listen to
[32:32] that episode with Dr. Malcolm Kendrick
[32:34] and I think uh you'll see that uh there
[32:37] are a lot more important things to worry
[32:38] about and the entire way in which the
[32:40] modern medical establishment thinks of
[32:42] cholesterol is completely ridiculous and
[32:45] counterproductive. But fasting insulin
[32:47] is a big one. Why do you think fasting
[32:48] insulin is important? Can you um
[32:50] explain?
[32:52] Yeah, I mean I I I think it's the best
[32:54] metric um or the best proxy for
[32:57] metabolic health. Um you know, in
[33:00] essence, if we can get our metabolic
[33:01] health in order, then all the chronic
[33:03] conditions, you know, fall away. And so
[33:06] you know fasting insulin is basically
[33:08] you know how much insulin is in your
[33:10] blood without you on a fasting you know
[33:13] after a period of time of fasting that
[33:15] just you know in essence tells you is
[33:17] your met metabolic health operating
[33:19] correctly or incorrectly as insulin goes
[33:22] up inflammation goes up as inflammation
[33:24] goes up cardiovascular health declines
[33:27] precipitously and from my perspective um
[33:30] and I'm not a doctor but from what the
[33:31] research that I've done it's the insulin
[33:33] levels in your blood that are much more
[33:36] a driver of cardiovascular disease than
[33:38] it is LDL. Um, I saw somebody the other
[33:41] day explain it pretty well and he said,
[33:43] "Look, you know, L LDL is the the
[33:46] firefighters and the inflammation are
[33:48] the fires and just because you take away
[33:51] some of the firefighters doesn't mean
[33:53] you're going to have less fires, you
[33:55] know, and so taking away the
[33:58] firefighters doesn't really help. LDL
[33:59] has tried to come in there to to solve
[34:02] the inflammation issue. So, we need
[34:04] let's solve the inflammation issue as
[34:05] opposed to trying to solve the the
[34:07] firefighter issue. Um, and so I've got a
[34:10] 250 LDL. I'm pretty darn high. Um, I
[34:12] haven't worried about it. I get a
[34:14] coronary artery calcium score every year
[34:16] just to make sure there's no plaque
[34:17] buildup. I've been doing the a a
[34:19] carnivore or a carnivore semi carnivore
[34:22] diet for the
[34:24] last seven or eight years. I've got zero
[34:27] plaque in my in my arteries. I'm good to
[34:30] go and I'm not really worried about it.
[34:31] Um, so and and I I have filled one
[34:35] prescription my entire life and it was
[34:38] because my first cardiologist said I
[34:39] needed to get on a statin because my LDL
[34:41] was so high. I can tell you that entire
[34:44] prescription was not used. It's still
[34:46] sitting in my desk. I don't even know
[34:48] why I still have it at my desk. But not
[34:50] one pill has been taken out of that
[34:51] because I've listened to folks like like
[34:53] you and others who are just like don't
[34:55] do this. This has actually it it it
[34:57] penetrates penetrates the the blood
[34:59] brain barrier for one and and your brain
[35:03] needs cholesterol to function properly.
[35:05] So you start taking cholesterol out of
[35:07] your brain cells and your brain cells
[35:09] start don't start operating correctly.
[35:11] That's why people who take statins a lot
[35:13] of them say I have I feel brain fog. I
[35:16] was like yeah you feel brain fog because
[35:18] the cells in your brain are comprised of
[35:21] cholesterol and you need that to
[35:23] function properly. So, I've not taken
[35:25] one of those pills. I maybe I just I
[35:27] keep it there to remind myself of, you
[35:29] know, the the medical industrial complex
[35:31] and the ways they're trying to
[35:33] manipulate us to maximize profits by
[35:36] feeding us, you know, pills that our
[35:38] bodies don't actually need that can be
[35:40] solved with a, you know, a high red
[35:43] meat, from my perspective, a high red
[35:45] meat diet. I know I'm preaching to the
[35:46] choir, but I get so like fired up about
[35:48] this and I'm like, "People, listen, stop
[35:51] stop eating the carbohydrates and start
[35:53] eating more red meat and you're going to
[35:55] be you're going to be fine." Um, so
[35:57] anyways, I'll get off my my high horse
[35:59] here, but it's it's something I'm like
[36:00] so fired up about that I'm like I wish
[36:03] people would listen to this. It's so
[36:05] contrary to what you earn on your high
[36:07] horse. You don't have to get off.
[36:11] No, I agree. I think the the the the
[36:13] cholesterol thing is just it's just
[36:15] absolutely amazing because I I think
[36:16] that's a great metaphor. It's it's
[36:18] really like the firefighters and if
[36:20] you're fighting the firefighters mean
[36:22] there is there is a way of looking at
[36:24] it. Yeah. Whenever there are
[36:25] firefighters there is fire and so the
[36:28] more fire you have the more firefighters
[36:30] you get. That doesn't mean that you can
[36:32] get rid of the fire by getting rid of
[36:33] the firefighters. And it's an essential
[36:35] compound that your body needs. And then
[36:37] the more you read about it, the more you
[36:39] see just how corrupt the science is, how
[36:41] wrong it is, how ridiculous it is. And
[36:45] it's not just an academic discussion.
[36:46] It's not just, oh, you're wrong about
[36:48] this. No, you're wrong about that. No,
[36:50] it's got really important real world
[36:53] implications, which is that if you
[36:55] continue to eat this way, if you
[36:57] continue to eat and take the drugs that
[36:58] they tell you, it's just going to be a
[37:01] continuous deterioration. I think the
[37:03] statins might be one of the I think they
[37:06] were the most profitable drug in
[37:08] history. They made so much money from
[37:11] this. They've allocated it to everybody
[37:12] cuz everybody's always eating carbs. So,
[37:14] everybody's always inflamed. Everybody's
[37:16] always got high cholesterol. Well, not
[37:17] everybody, but you know, when people get
[37:19] into their 50s, even their
[37:22] 40s, it's highly likely that if you do
[37:25] go and get your cholesterol tested,
[37:27] you're going to show up high. And then
[37:29] once you've uh taken that statin and
[37:33] then it's just you've entered the vortex
[37:36] of medical complications, more drugs,
[37:40] more procedures, more tests, and now you
[37:43] are a good customer. Now your doctor's
[37:45] happy with you because he's making a lot
[37:46] of money from you. Your insurance
[37:48] company's happy because they're making a
[37:50] lot of money from you, and you you're
[37:52] sacrificing your health for the
[37:54] financial gain of others. Whereas on the
[37:56] other hand, if you just quit causing the
[37:58] fire in the first place, you put the
[38:00] firefighters out of business. You put
[38:02] the entire industry out of business. But
[38:06] although I I should I should clarify, I
[38:08] think cholesterol uh the statins were
[38:09] the most profitable drug in history
[38:11] before COVID and the magic fiser juice
[38:14] came and broke all the records, I think.
[38:17] But I think you're right. I think until
[38:19] the last two years, uh something has
[38:21] overtaken statins, but it's still, you
[38:23] know, in the top two or three. Yeah. And
[38:26] now the crazy thing is that now it's no
[38:28] longer patented. The drugs for statins
[38:30] are now generic. So nobody's really
[38:33] making much money from it. But there's
[38:35] this is the ridiculous thing that
[38:37] there's just so much institutional
[38:38] inertia behind it. and so many people
[38:40] who have been prescribing it for so long
[38:42] that even though pharma doesn't really
[38:44] care anymore, the academic establishment
[38:46] and the medical uh doctors don't want to
[38:49] stop prescribing it and don't want to
[38:52] admit to being wrong because it's pretty
[38:54] devastating to their credibility to say,
[38:56] "Yeah, sorry. We put you on this
[38:57] terrible drug for the past 40 years and
[38:59] it's made you u become scenile and it's
[39:02] destroyed your health and it's made us a
[39:04] lot of money, but anyways, let's move
[39:07] on."
[39:08] One one real quick thing on that safe
[39:10] because I think it is it is recent. Um I
[39:14] believe Dave Feldman and Nick Norwitz
[39:16] and some others have recently come out
[39:18] with a study showing lean mass
[39:21] hyperresponders and basically these are
[39:22] people who are metabolically healthy. Um
[39:26] there were a hund of them. They were on
[39:28] a a ketoc carnivore diet. Um and then
[39:31] they tracked. So these are L lean mass
[39:34] hyper responders are basically people
[39:35] who are metabolically healthy but have
[39:37] really really high LDL. Um I think the
[39:39] LDL on average was like 260. So it was
[39:42] really really high. And the reason that
[39:44] they are studying these people is
[39:45] because in all other ways they are
[39:47] healthy. They wanted just to focus on
[39:50] that LDL and what LDL does to your body
[39:53] when you have a a a high u uh protein
[39:58] high fat diet. And so they tracked a 100
[40:00] people, I think it was over 10 years,
[40:02] and they did coronary artery calcium
[40:04] score tests every year. So this is a
[40:06] test that shows the plaque that's built
[40:08] up in your coronary artery. And they saw
[40:11] zero impact to the plaque buildup in
[40:13] your heart over 10 years for these
[40:15] people with wickedly high LDL levels.
[40:18] And so it it basically proved um or it's
[40:21] a a big step in proving that
[40:24] LDL if you are metabolically healthy LDL
[40:27] has zero impact on the plaque buildup in
[40:30] your in your heart. And so I think it
[40:32] was and this came out last week. I think
[40:35] it's really important because you know
[40:36] there's actually studies that are
[40:38] showing this now um that are are very
[40:41] detailed and um and and very very clear
[40:44] in their conclusions.
[40:47] Yeah, absolutely. And I think uh that
[40:50] they've also shown all kinds of uh
[40:52] ridiculous results uh when um I think it
[40:55] was Nick Noritz who did an experiment
[40:56] where he was eating a lot of Oreos and
[40:58] then eating eggs and then showing the
[41:00] impact and the eggs turned out to look
[41:03] uh to be worse for his cholesterol than
[41:06] uh the Oreos. I think that was the study
[41:07] that he did. Uh was that it? Do you
[41:10] remember? No, he he actually I think his
[41:12] his study I think he ate Oreos I think
[41:17] for like a week or two weeks straight
[41:18] like that's all he ate which are you
[41:20] know super high in in uh in and you know
[41:25] Oreos Yeah, Oreos actually were worse
[41:27] for your LDL. Low cholesterol Oreos were
[41:30] worse for your LDL than his two weeks
[41:33] where he just ate eggs. That actually
[41:35] reduced his LDL cholesterol as opposed
[41:37] to increased your LDL cholesterol. So in
[41:40] essence what he was saying is like look
[41:42] your body is very good at you know
[41:44] manipulating your LDL so it's the right
[41:46] amount for your body your lifestyle
[41:48] what's going on with you and so it was
[41:51] just kind of a funny study that actually
[41:52] showed that it was the opposite of what
[41:54] you thought the low LDL which to you
[41:56] know the that the Oreos which totally
[41:59] screw up your metabolism um you know
[42:02] actually raised your LDL whereas the
[42:04] high cholesterol eggs which are great
[42:05] for your metabolism actually lowered his
[42:07] LDL and so was you It was a super
[42:10] unscientific study. He just kind of did
[42:12] it as a kind of a Um but it was
[42:15] really interesting the impact that it
[42:16] had on his his LDL specifically. Yeah. I
[42:20] think you know the more that I read
[42:21] about this the more that I um arrive at
[42:24] a pretty
[42:25] uh pretty
[42:28] uh ignorant perhaps conclusion or just a
[42:33] conclusion wherein you realize you know
[42:35] what reading all of these papers is
[42:37] maybe a waste of time. You're better off
[42:39] just eating meat and not reading any
[42:41] scientific literature than spending all
[42:43] of your time trying to figure out the
[42:45] ideal diet by reading PubMed papers. And
[42:47] it's I mean it sounds ridiculous and I
[42:50] know a lot of people won't like this but
[42:52] you know if you're eating if you're
[42:55] reading PubMed and you're eating any
[42:57] kind of carbohydrates, you're eating any
[42:59] kind of
[43:01] sugar, you're really scamming yourself.
[43:03] I think uh I wonder just how much of all
[43:06] of this nutrition and medical science is
[43:09] positive for humanity because if you
[43:12] just if you just told somebody to just
[43:13] eat meat, I think they would they would
[43:16] be eating a lot healthier than people
[43:19] who are spending all of their time going
[43:21] over all kinds of
[43:23] uh very very very sophisticated ways of
[43:27] approaching science and diet and you
[43:29] should eat this and eat that and try
[43:31] this particular seed.
[43:33] uh or that particular herb that is
[43:36] harvested in the Himalayas and this and
[43:38] this. You don't need any of this
[43:39] sophisticated garbage to help eat a cow.
[43:41] You'll be fine. Exactly. They're
[43:43] probably raised in your backyard. Go
[43:45] talk to a rancher, get it directly from
[43:47] them and eat a cow and you'll be fine.
[43:49] You know, the big thing in the United
[43:50] States right now with Trump um is that
[43:53] uh he is pulling funding from these
[43:56] private universities like, you know,
[43:58] Harvard and and and those. and he's
[44:01] doing it because of some of the DEI
[44:03] policies that they have and they said
[44:05] look you got to get rid of DEI but
[44:07] Harvard got almost a billion dollars of
[44:09] taxpayer money last year and the vast
[44:11] majority of that was going to medical
[44:13] research and if you look at Harvard and
[44:17] all the um donations I went in the chat
[44:20] GPT and I just said tell me all the
[44:22] donations from pharma that Harvard has
[44:24] gotten over the last you know five years
[44:26] and it was pages and pages of all these
[44:29] contributions
[44:30] by pharmaceutical companies to Harvard
[44:33] Medical School to do these uh to do
[44:36] these you know trials and things like
[44:38] that. I was like okay so United States
[44:40] government is giving money to a
[44:41] university that is also being funded by
[44:43] pharma to create nutritional studies
[44:46] that are clearly biased. Um, and so from
[44:49] my perspective, it's like, hell yeah,
[44:51] you know, take take money away from, you
[44:53] know, Harvard Medical School. Um,
[44:54] because most of their their studies are
[44:56] absolute garbage that are biased based
[44:58] upon their ties to to big pharma. So,
[45:02] um, you know, that's a big big to-do
[45:04] right now in the United States around
[45:06] uh, you know, the funding of the these
[45:08] big private universities. By the way,
[45:10] Harvard's got a $50 billion endowment.
[45:12] So, why am I as a taxpayer paying
[45:14] Harvard a billion dollars a year to go
[45:17] and do something where they got $50
[45:18] billion that's, you know, racking in,
[45:21] you know, big-time profits? Um, use that
[45:24] instead of my money. Yeah. And also, I
[45:26] mean, the track record of Harvard in
[45:28] particular has got to be perhaps the
[45:30] worst of all the universities. It is.
[45:32] Yeah. I mean uh in in fiat medicine in
[45:34] fiat food the book that uh Matthew wrote
[45:37] and I published at the safe house in
[45:39] that book there's an extensive chapter
[45:41] on how Harvard and also Nina Tai Schultz
[45:45] in her book the big fat surprise she
[45:47] also discusses that in the 19 I think it
[45:49] was 60s or 70s the sugar industry paid
[45:53] enormous amounts of money to Harvard and
[45:55] the Harvard nutrition department
[45:58] was basically a sugar advertisement. It
[46:01] was all about how sugar is good for you.
[46:03] Sugar is a nice snack. Sugar is a good
[46:05] way to uh um control your hunger. Sugar
[46:09] is not too bad. And Coca-Cola is fine.
[46:14] And um I think his name is Frederick
[46:16] Stair was the uh chairman of the
[46:18] nutrition department. He made tons of
[46:20] money. He made tons of money. Died
[46:22] filthy rich
[46:23] from getting money from the food
[46:25] industry. So, if you really look at
[46:28] their track record, I mean, they've been
[46:30] promoting all of these horrific diets
[46:32] because a they're good for the uh
[46:35] industrial food producers and b and
[46:37] perhaps more importantly, they're good
[46:39] for the medical industry because the
[46:40] medical industry makes a lot of money
[46:41] from you getting sick. So it's it's it's
[46:45] really the the the
[46:46] the pernicious thing about government
[46:49] funding to universities is not so much
[46:50] the money itself perhaps in as much as
[46:53] it is the legitimacy that they get from
[46:56] that government funding that then allows
[46:58] them to turn around and opine with a lot
[47:01] of authority about what it is that you
[47:02] should be eating when in reality you
[47:04] really shouldn't be eating what they're
[47:06] saying. They're just doing what their
[47:08] sponsors want.
[47:10] Yeah. A amen. Amen. So I I I love that
[47:14] book, too. So we we we definitely
[47:16] recommen recommend our members going out
[47:18] and and getting it because uh it it gets
[47:20] to the heart of of some of these
[47:22] perverse incentives that we have within
[47:25] healthcare. I mean, as you said, you
[47:27] know, do do does the the medical
[47:29] industrial complex make more money or
[47:30] less money if you're sick? Clearly, it
[47:33] makes it makes more money. And so, you
[47:36] know, maybe the most perverse incentive
[47:38] of all is that the people you go to for
[47:41] care actually make more money when
[47:43] you're sick. Um, I mean, that's that's a
[47:46] tragedy from from my perspective. And as
[47:48] I just mentioned, health insurance over
[47:51] the intermediate term actually makes
[47:53] more money if you are sick. Um, you
[47:56] know, United Healthcare, I think it was
[47:59] last year or the year before, I think
[48:01] had three times more diabetics in their
[48:05] population than in the general
[48:07] population. And so, what is going on
[48:09] there? Well, they go in and they, you
[48:10] know, find people that kind of have
[48:13] diabetes and they upcode them to having
[48:16] full-blown diabetes u because they make
[48:18] more money if you have they get paid
[48:21] more by the government if you have
[48:22] diabetes. Um, it is a a completely
[48:26] perverse system that, you know, we're
[48:28] trying to upend. The Bitcoin Standard

[49:59] Matthew's book, Fiat Medicine, Fiat
[50:01] food, uh this may be the first time that
[50:03] we publicly talk about this, but we're
[50:05] going to be publishing at the safe
[50:06] house. We're going to be publishing
[50:07] another book by Matthew and by you,
[50:09] Andy, and also with a chapter by my
[50:12] brother Ahmed Amulus, who's also been on
[50:14] the podcast. And that book is going to
[50:16] be called Fiat Medicine. And it's going
[50:18] to be applying the same framework of
[50:20] fiat food and the fiat standard to try
[50:22] and understand how medicine has been
[50:25] dysfunctional. Dr. Mary Bowen is going
[50:27] to be writing the forward for that book.
[50:29] I'm really looking forward to it. I
[50:31] haven't, uh, read the manuscript yet,
[50:33] but Matthew's been updating me about it.
[50:35] So, uh, can you tell us a little bit of
[50:37] a sneak preview into, uh, what this book
[50:39] is about?
[50:41] Yeah, I mean like like Matthew did with
[50:42] Fiat food, he takes us from the
[50:44] beginning and and walks us through how
[50:47] did we get to this place of our medical
[50:49] industrial complex profiteering off of
[50:52] our our sickness, you know, how how it's
[50:54] the sick care industry as opposed to the
[50:57] healthcare industry. So he walks us
[50:59] through till present day. Um I get a
[51:01] little bit of time to talk about where
[51:03] we're at in present day and what it
[51:05] could look like going forward. What if
[51:08] we decentralized all of medicine as
[51:10] opposed to having these centralized
[51:12] profitering middlemen in the middle of
[51:14] it? So what does that look look like?
[51:16] And then your brother takes, you know,
[51:18] some time to talk about it from a a
[51:20] doctor's perspective since he is a a
[51:22] doctor and what he is seeing in, you
[51:24] know, the medical industrial complex and
[51:26] and what the medical industrial complex
[51:27] actually does to our our health and to
[51:30] the patients in this country. And so I
[51:33] think it'll be a really interesting kind
[51:35] of comprehensive look at, you know,
[51:37] where where we were, where we're at, and
[51:38] where we should be headed. And so, you
[51:40] know, this is not just complaining about
[51:42] the medical industrial complex. We
[51:44] actually throw out real solutions, we
[51:48] think, to the problem that are scalable
[51:50] that can be used by everybody in the
[51:52] United States. And so, I think it's
[51:54] going to be I don't think there's
[51:55] anything else out there like it. There's
[51:56] a lot of books, you know, complaining
[51:58] about all the issues. there's very few
[51:59] books out there that actually talk about
[52:00] the solutions and so we're excited to to
[52:03] get that published, you know, here in in
[52:06] the next few months. So, we're excited
[52:07] about that. Yeah, I think this is a very
[52:10] powerful point and it's true with the
[52:12] Bitcoin standard, the fiat standard, and
[52:14] with fiat food. And I think it'll be the
[52:16] same with fiat medicine as books, which
[52:18] is that there are a lot of books out
[52:19] there talking about the problems in
[52:21] economics or in medicine or in food. and
[52:24] that a lot of people who do a really
[52:27] good job of identifying the symptoms of
[52:29] the problem. But I really think you
[52:31] can't really grasp the cause of the
[52:33] problem if you don't understand the
[52:35] problem of money. I think money is just
[52:38] such a pervasive thing. It's one half of
[52:40] every transaction. It pervades every
[52:42] aspect of our lives. It pervades your
[52:45] decisions about your future. It pervades
[52:48] how you purchase things. It's
[52:51] everywhere. And the fact the government
[52:53] has a magic printer that allows it to
[52:54] print more of that money. Yeah. Amen. Is
[52:58] an enormous enormous factor. And once
[53:00] you start the thing is I I mean it's uh
[53:03] my sort of secret sauce to my success as
[53:06] a writer is precisely that I've just
[53:09] identified this massive massive massive
[53:12] uh open field of inquiry where academics
[53:16] don't go because academics are not
[53:19] encouraged or I should say they are
[53:22] actively discouraged from being uh too
[53:26] critical of inflation on being too
[53:28] critical of money printing. Ultimately
[53:30] academics at universities get paid from
[53:32] the money printer as we were saying you
[53:34] know the universities get a lot of
[53:36] funding from the government. Your
[53:38] ability to make it as an academic is
[53:41] entire well not entirely but to a very
[53:44] long very large extent dependent on your
[53:47] ability to tow the line of the people
[53:49] who control the money printer. And so
[53:50] the best way to get on their bad side is
[53:54] to find ways for not printing money. And
[53:56] so people who are writing about health,
[54:00] medicine, economics, whatever it is, as
[54:02] long as they stay away from mentioning
[54:04] the money printing, they can get their
[54:07] career ahead. So you can go along and
[54:10] talk about the evils of the um insurance
[54:13] companies, the evils of uh the big food
[54:15] industry, the evils of this and that,
[54:17] it's all fine. But once you start
[54:19] talking about the evils of the money
[54:21] printing, then it's it's it's not easy
[54:24] to make your career. whether it's in
[54:26] economics or in anything else. And so
[54:29] once you have Bitcoin like I do and you
[54:32] decide to leave the academic field, well
[54:35] then there's just an enormous enormous
[54:37] open field of uh questions to be asked
[54:40] and all you got to do is just think, all
[54:42] right, well somebody's got a money
[54:43] printer and everybody else is having
[54:46] their money devalued. How do those
[54:48] things affect whatever question I'm
[54:50] looking at? And it could be anything.
[54:53] anything is going to be affected by this
[54:54] enormous dynamic that people are
[54:56] constantly losing purchasing power and
[54:58] that purchasing power is going to a
[55:00] government that can hand out that money
[55:03] without facing a market test. So then
[55:05] apply that to anything, apply that to
[55:06] the food industry, apply that to health
[55:09] and you start seeing incredible
[55:11] explanatory power that allows you to
[55:13] really make sense of how the world works
[55:15] a lot better. And I think this is really
[55:17] uh this is the secret sauce to what I'm
[55:20] doing with the safe house is just trying
[55:22] to publish more and more books that
[55:23] start from this premise. And I think
[55:26] it's it's it's it's a very powerful
[55:28] thing. So I'm really looking forward to
[55:29] reading this book. Yeah. I mean what you
[55:32] guys are doing at Safe House is a is is
[55:34] for sure a societal good because so many
[55:36] people are just oblivious to the impact
[55:39] that the money printer has on everything
[55:41] they do. Not just the value of your your
[55:44] dollar. Um, it's the value of your
[55:46] healthcare, too. And so, it's pervasive
[55:49] in in almost everything that we do in
[55:51] our life is is is dictated by the money
[55:55] printer in in Washington DC, which is
[55:57] just, you know, the epitome of
[55:59] centralization. I mean, they have power
[56:01] over so many things that we do in our
[56:03] life. And if we can alleviate ourselves
[56:05] from that, if we can get off the fiat
[56:07] standard um and into Bitcoin, um I think
[56:10] that would just be a tremendous value to
[56:12] humanity. And so, you know, while I want
[56:14] to fix healthcare, I also think that
[56:16] that's a really interesting way of of
[56:18] helping to fix our monetary system, too,
[56:20] by taking healthcare off the fiat
[56:22] standard and putting it on the Bitcoin
[56:24] standard. And so, that's ultimately my
[56:26] my vision. And maybe I'm taking on too
[56:28] much, you know, at once, but I feel
[56:30] like, man, if you can get the monetary
[56:31] system figured out and the health care
[56:33] system figured out, like, that's a a
[56:34] pretty big, you know, big hairy
[56:37] audacious goal. Um, and and that's what
[56:39] we're we're we're firing on. Yeah. And I
[56:42] mean, let's face it, if you're eating
[56:44] meat and stacking SATs, you have figured
[56:46] it out. It's uh it's it's it's not a
[56:49] university or school exam where you need
[56:51] to write the perfect essay and you don't
[56:53] need to
[56:54] uh life's real test is in the actual way
[57:00] in which you live your life. So, the
[57:01] correct answer is to stack sats and eat
[57:04] meat. If you figure that out, you pass.
[57:07] Yeah. I mean our it's interesting
[57:09] because our largest contingent of people
[57:10] within crowd health are our Bitcoiners.
[57:12] The second largest are carnivores and
[57:15] you know there's overlap there clearly u
[57:17] but we have a huge group of carnivores
[57:18] in the community. And then we have a
[57:21] huge group of people who just don't want
[57:23] to to participate in western medicine.
[57:26] So they're they're looking for holistic
[57:28] and naturopathic and integrative docs.
[57:30] You know we have a bunch of people who
[57:32] are who are going to you know Chinese
[57:34] medicine docs. um you know all kinds of
[57:36] docs that are kind of outside of the
[57:38] medical industrial complex because they
[57:40] don't what the way our system is
[57:42] currently set up again I think this is
[57:43] driven by the the money printer is that
[57:46] doctors only have something like 8
[57:48] minutes to talk to you when you go into
[57:50] the primary care doc because their
[57:52] reimbursement rates have gone down
[57:53] significantly the value of that not only
[57:56] is their rate their literal rate uh gone
[57:58] down but it's gotten in you know deflate
[58:01] or inflated right the dollar has gotten
[58:03] inflated and so the money they're being
[58:05] paid is actually less than the actual
[58:07] discount that they got from last year.
[58:08] My rates's gone down 5%. But in reality,
[58:10] my rate has really gone down probably 10
[58:12] to 15%. And so they just don't have
[58:14] enough time to spend with you to talk
[58:16] about core issues. And so what
[58:19] happens? They they have to give you a
[58:21] drug. Like they have to alleviate your
[58:23] symptoms as opposed to getting to the
[58:24] root cause of what's going on in your
[58:26] life. And so again, the money printer is
[58:30] is dictating so much of our life, even
[58:32] down to our primary care doc visit where
[58:35] they only have eight minutes now because
[58:36] they can't afford to spend more time
[58:38] with you than that. And that impacts our
[58:40] healthcare because I can't tell him
[58:42] about what I'm eating, how much I'm
[58:44] working out, how I'm sleeping, you know,
[58:46] those types of things. They just don't
[58:47] have time. they have to give you a drug
[58:50] to alleviate the symptom and it makes
[58:52] you happy but it's a short-term again
[58:55] high time preference fix as opposing to
[58:57] go root cause low time preference so
[59:00] that you don't have these recurring
[59:01] health issues over the next decade. Um
[59:04] you know that's the tragedy of our our
[59:06] system that is rooted in in money
[59:08] printing. Yeah. And of course another
[59:10] part of this is that they're
[59:12] constantly they have to give you the
[59:14] standard of care. They have to tell you
[59:16] what they are told by their medical uh
[59:19] licensing bodies, by their medical
[59:21] school. There's a standard of care and
[59:23] if you don't stick to that and anything
[59:25] bad happens to the patient, even though
[59:27] it might not be because of what you did,
[59:30] you are liable to being sued and that
[59:31] could destroy your life. So the whole
[59:34] centralization of it leads to every
[59:37] doctor essentially being a prescription
[59:40] bot. I think that's really I read this
[59:42] somewhere on Twitter and I think it's a
[59:43] it's it's the best way of describing
[59:45] doctors and I think and and this was a
[59:48] this was a term that was more apt before
[59:51] chat GPT and the AI revolution because
[59:54] now bots are a lot more advanced but
[59:57] this was I think you know modern
[60:00] medicine produces doctors that are bots
[60:03] by 2010 technology standard wherein they
[60:07] you give them three four symptoms and
[60:09] they run them through their training and
[60:13] you know this symptom means then we
[60:15] narrow it down to one of those four
[60:17] things. You add another symptom, then we
[60:18] narrow it down to two. Then you add
[60:20] another symptom, then we narrow it down
[60:22] to this and therefore we give you that
[60:25] drug. And it's it's such a shame because
[60:28] these are some of the smartest, hardest
[60:29] working, most um focused and dedicated
[60:32] people. you know, you don't make it out
[60:34] of medical school unless you're
[60:36] seriously intelligent and um seriously
[60:39] capable of spending a lot of time
[60:41] working on something. Takes a lot of
[60:43] discipline and focus to be able to get
[60:45] to medical school and yet everything
[60:46] that they do is just follow very simple
[60:50] decision tree. You know, if all right,
[60:51] his back hurts, so therefore it's got to
[60:53] be one of those things. So you ask this
[60:55] question and then based on the answer
[60:57] you go do this and and it's just a very
[60:59] simple decision tree that any
[61:00] 15-year-old could do if you just give
[61:01] them the decision tree but they have to
[61:04] go through eight years of medicine
[61:05] school medical school well undergraduate
[61:07] and then medical school and then
[61:09] training get into mountains of debt and
[61:11] then become completely beholden to the
[61:12] system because they're so invested in
[61:15] it. they've they've gotten into so much
[61:18] debt and they need the system in order
[61:20] to pay them off and that's why they end
[61:23] up with this situation where you don't
[61:25] have this personal relationship between
[61:26] a doctor and a patient and the doctor is
[61:28] not allowed almost to think. The doctor
[61:30] is not able to look at their patients
[61:32] and think about what they're doing. I've
[61:33] heard this from so many people. They're
[61:36] they'll go to their doctor and they'll
[61:39] they'll get a checkup and the doctor
[61:40] will look at results and says, "Wow,
[61:42] that's great. um you know, your
[61:43] cholesterol is looking a lot better,
[61:45] your this and that. It's all looking so
[61:48] much better. So, clearly you've been
[61:49] doing well. Um what have you been uh
[61:51] doing different? And the patient will
[61:53] say, "Well, actually, I've started
[61:54] eating low carb or I've started eating
[61:56] carnivore. I've started eating keto."
[61:58] And the doctor says, "Wow, that's weird.
[61:59] You got to be careful. It's bad for your
[62:01] kidneys or it's bad for your lymph nodes
[62:03] or it's bad for this or this or that or
[62:04] it causes colon cancer." And then zero
[62:07] curiosity. zero curiosity to think why
[62:10] is it that this guy doing the exact
[62:11] opposite of what I told him to do is
[62:14] achieving the results that what I told
[62:16] him to do would never have achieved and
[62:18] so doctors will be like no this is
[62:20] insane you can't you know you use you're
[62:22] a 55year-old and you used to be
[62:24] overweight and you had all these things
[62:26] and now you've got the blood work of a
[62:28] 40year-old that makes no sense you'd
[62:30] think they'd be curious to try and look
[62:32] into this more but they can't afford to
[62:34] be they can't just go and tell the next
[62:36] patient to do what the first patient did
[62:38] they don't have this ability of learning
[62:39] and that's the only way thing that makes
[62:41] a doctor. I don't care how much time you
[62:43] spend in medical school. I don't care
[62:45] how much uh you read. I don't care how
[62:47] many textbooks you swallow. It doesn't
[62:50] matter. You need to be interacting with
[62:51] human beings and you need to be building
[62:53] your understanding from your real
[62:55] interaction based on your experience.
[62:57] You told this guy to do this and he got
[62:58] better. You told this guy to do that, he
[63:00] got worse. So from now on I'm going to
[63:02] be recommending this thing. If you don't
[63:04] have that mental process, then you're
[63:06] essentially useless. You're just a
[63:08] you're just a very simple decision tree.
[63:11] Yeah. You're you're you start to be a
[63:12] doer instead of a thinker. And we have
[63:14] some of the greatest thinkers in the
[63:15] world. You know, your brother included
[63:17] who are doctors who like we need to give
[63:20] them the the autonomy to actually think
[63:22] and use their brains as opposed to this
[63:24] decision tree. And unfortunately the
[63:26] decision tree is created by
[63:28] organizations these accreditation
[63:30] organizations who are typically bought
[63:33] out by pharmaceutical and big food to
[63:36] make the decision tree you know more
[63:39] profitable for for them. you know, um,
[63:41] you know, I saw something the other day
[63:43] where the American Diabetes Association
[63:44] was putting recipes on their website and
[63:47] these recipes for people with diabetes
[63:49] had something like 60 or 70 gram of
[63:53] carbohydrates in them. And I'm sitting
[63:55] here being like, what the hell are we
[63:57] doing feeding these people with
[63:59] diabetes, you know, 60 or 70 grams of
[64:01] carbohydrates with each meal? I mean,
[64:03] it's it's it's ridiculous. And the only
[64:05] thing it's going to do is ensure that
[64:08] they stay on insulin, ensure that the
[64:11] big insulin producers continue to make
[64:13] money. Um, and you know, shockingly, you
[64:16] know, a lot of these pharmaceutical
[64:18] companies are funding these
[64:19] organizations. So, they are the ones in
[64:21] essence creating the standard of care to
[64:23] ensure that their product continues to
[64:25] be used. So, you know, and they got a
[64:27] lot more money than anybody else does.
[64:29] You know, unfortunately, the American
[64:30] Cattleman's Association doesn't have a
[64:32] whole lot of money to to lobby, you
[64:34] know, these big big organizations or
[64:36] even Congress to change change what's
[64:38] going on here. And so, the one with the
[64:40] money wins. Again, total direct, you
[64:43] know, impact from the money printer. And
[64:45] so, we are just um it's it's perverse
[64:48] throughout our throughout our system.
[64:50] So, you know, we try to get people to
[64:52] independent docs. independent docs are
[64:54] willing to go against the standard of
[64:56] care more than the big health system
[64:58] docs. Unfortunately, the insurance
[65:01] companies are buying the doctors. So,
[65:03] the largest owner of doctors right now
[65:04] in the United States is United
[65:06] Healthcare. There are a million doctors
[65:07] in the United States, United Healthcare
[65:09] owns 100,000 of them. So, 10% of them
[65:12] are owned by one company. Um and so with
[65:14] consider continued consolidation you
[65:17] know lots of liquidity you know
[65:19] historically very low interest rates
[65:21] these have all got
[65:22] consolidated and so you know the
[65:24] centralization continues so my other
[65:27] people who are listening you know at
[65:28] least in the United States I don't know
[65:29] how this applies overseas but like go
[65:31] find independent doctors as opposed to
[65:34] doctors associated with big hospital
[65:36] systems they much more likely to have
[65:40] your worldview than um the worldview of
[65:43] kind of the cultural norm. So, um,
[65:45] highly recommend finding an independent
[65:47] doctor in your loca in your area,
[65:49] especially cardiology, especially some
[65:51] of these specialists. They are a little
[65:53] bit more freethinking than your big
[65:54] hospital system um doctors,
[65:57] unfortunately.
[65:59] Yeah, absolutely. I think this is uh
[66:02] being able to just develop a personal
[66:03] relationship with a doctor and being
[66:05] able to see that they are an intelligent
[66:07] person who thinks is, I think, really
[66:10] important. And you might think that
[66:12] they're not out there, but they are.
[66:14] There are many of those people. And the
[66:16] beautiful thing is that you can find
[66:17] these people online now. You don't have
[66:19] to see them. You know, with a video
[66:20] camera, they can uh the with a video
[66:24] call. They can get quite a bit of um
[66:28] what a doctor could get if they were
[66:30] seeing you in person. They can
[66:32] commission the studies uh the tests that
[66:34] you need and get the results. So you can
[66:36] get quite a bit from uh tele medicine
[66:39] just talking to intelligent doctors. I
[66:42] think I highly recommend that. And I'm
[66:43] going to go ahead and shill my brother
[66:45] as well, Ahmed Almus. He's uh doing
[66:47] this. And so yeah, if you're looking for
[66:49] a doctor who's not into the fiat world,
[66:52] check out my brother Ahmed Amus. uh he
[66:55] he does te consulting which I think is
[66:58] really good because I mean he can help a
[67:01] lot of people who are just lost who have
[67:02] no idea about any of the things that we
[67:04] take for granted and can't really take
[67:06] them seriously unless they come uh from
[67:08] a doctor who knows what he's talking
[67:10] about who can go through all of the
[67:12] things that your fiat doctor says and
[67:14] explain to you why your fiat doctor is
[67:16] wrong explain to you the incentives for
[67:19] him to be wrong explain to you why the
[67:22] way in which he's wrong is hurting you.
[67:24] So, I I very much recommend that. And
[67:26] yeah, so when you combine that, take
[67:30] care of your own health, find a doctor
[67:31] that you can actually talk to that
[67:32] understands how things are going, and
[67:35] then get out of the insurance scam. I
[67:37] mean, that's just such an enormous
[67:39] improvement in your health and uh in
[67:42] your finances as well. It it's it's
[67:44] going to really make a difference, I
[67:46] think.
[67:48] Hey, man. You know, like I said, we're
[67:49] we're like 50% less. If you if you exit
[67:52] the system, we're about 50% less. We had
[67:54] a guy the other day, he was paying
[67:56] $3,000 a month for him and his wife and
[67:58] his two kids. And with Crowd Health, it
[68:00] was something like 640 a month. So they
[68:02] they saved what is that 80% or something
[68:05] like that um by by switching over. And
[68:07] so, you know, it reestablishes the
[68:09] doctor patient relationship. You're not
[68:11] subject to any of these perverse
[68:13] incentives. It's just a much better way
[68:15] of of doing things. So, um, you know,
[68:17] we'd love for any Bitcoiners out there
[68:19] especially to come and and join us.
[68:21] You'd be an awesome awesome ad to the to
[68:24] the crowd. Yeah. And one interesting uh
[68:27] point data point I saw you mention is
[68:30] that something like 550,000 Americans
[68:33] declare medical bankruptcy each year,
[68:35] which is just astounding. Half a million
[68:37] people and 80% of them have health
[68:40] insurance.
[68:43] That's right. I mean, we we we've got
[68:45] hundreds of thousands of families going
[68:46] bankrupt every year due to a medical
[68:49] event even though they have health
[68:51] insurance. So, the whole point of health
[68:52] insurance or insurance in general is to
[68:55] not put you in financial distress in the
[68:57] case of something big happening. And so,
[68:58] we have hundreds of thousands of
[69:00] families going bankrupt when something
[69:01] big happens even though they have health
[69:03] insurance. And so, the question is is
[69:04] why why does that happen? One is they
[69:07] have huge deductibles. So you go on
[69:09] these, you know, Affordable Care Act,
[69:11] Obamacare plans, and these do
[69:13] deductibles are something like, you
[69:14] know, 10, 12,
[69:16] $14,000. You know, I looked just because
[69:18] I was curious for my family what my rate
[69:20] would be, and I think it was 13 or
[69:22] $1,400 a year and or a month and then it
[69:25] was 14 or $16,000 u depending upon what
[69:28] plan I chose um for a deductible, which
[69:32] means that, you know, I got to pay the
[69:34] first $14,000 before the health
[69:36] insurance plan pays a dime. And so if
[69:39] you include the premiums every month,
[69:40] I'm paying the first
[69:42] $30,000 before our health insurance, you
[69:44] know, pays the dime. That just doesn't
[69:46] make sense for me and my family. And for
[69:48] most of the people watching this, it
[69:49] doesn't make sense for you either. And
[69:51] so if you don't have $14,000 on hand,
[69:55] um, and you have a big health event,
[69:57] then you're toast. Um, and you have to
[70:00] go into bankruptcy. I mean, that's your
[70:02] only other option, unfortunately. So
[70:04] that's the first reason. The second
[70:05] reason is, and I didn't really
[70:06] understand this before I had my little
[70:08] debacle with my health insurance plan,
[70:10] is 20% of bills are denied. One in five.
[70:14] So, you got a one in five chance of you
[70:16] have something big happening and the
[70:18] health insurance plan denies it. So,
[70:21] they think it's a guarantee that you're
[70:22] going to get paid when you have a claim,
[70:24] but that's just not the case. as we have
[70:25] seen um you know we've we've seen you
[70:29] know unfortunately this Luigi Manion
[70:31] thing you know killing the the CEO of
[70:33] United Healthcare back in December was a
[70:36] reflection of this where he had you know
[70:38] huge bills and United was either denying
[70:40] them or they were delaying them which
[70:42] means when you submit a bill they'll say
[70:45] I need more information before I'll
[70:46] approve it I need more information I
[70:48] need more information and they can
[70:49] string this thing out over a long period
[70:51] of time and you have no recourse like
[70:54] your health is is in the hands of these
[70:55] health insurance companies and if they
[70:57] don't take care of you then bankruptcy
[70:59] is is unfortunately the only answer for
[71:01] a lot of these families. So, you know,
[71:04] we have 10,000 members. We've served
[71:06] almost 15,000 members over the last four
[71:08] years. And we've had zero bankruptcies
[71:10] within our our community over over a
[71:12] healthcare expense. And so, we're pretty
[71:15] pretty happy with that with that
[71:16] outcome. And we've built our system so
[71:18] that anybody can can afford this. Um, if
[71:21] you have a big health event, we ask you
[71:24] to pay the first 500 bucks. Um, so if
[71:26] it's a cancer case and you have 50
[71:29] doctor visits and 20 imaging and a
[71:31] prescription and surgeries and all these
[71:33] things, that's one health event. So you
[71:36] got to pay the first 500 bucks of that.
[71:38] The rest of it is submitted to
[71:39] community. From our perspective, anybody
[71:41] can come up with 500 bucks. Like anybody
[71:43] in this, you know, country can come up
[71:45] with 500 bucks to figure out how to pay
[71:47] for that. and that keeps people from
[71:48] going into financial distress if if
[71:50] something really really big happens to
[71:52] them. So, you know, it's it's a tragedy
[71:54] that people are are going bankrupt due
[71:56] to to a medical expense. And we we're
[71:58] solving that. Yeah. And apparently
[72:00] there's there's been a huge lawsuit
[72:03] against United Healthcare because they
[72:05] used AI to deny 90% of people the claims
[72:09] which 90% of them would have should have
[72:14] been um paid as part of the um as part
[72:18] of the policies of their company, but
[72:20] they used some chat GPT thing and then
[72:24] whoops, they took away your money and
[72:26] now you're bankrupt. Yeah. And it's
[72:28] actually even worse. Um, you know, what
[72:30] some of these health insurance plans do
[72:32] is, as I mentioned earlier, if you have
[72:34] $1,000 of premiums and you're at, so
[72:36] that that allocates kind of $850 to your
[72:38] medical care and $150 for their profit
[72:41] and administrative costs. If that $850
[72:44] starts creeping up into $860 or $870 or
[72:46] $880, which means the medical expenses
[72:48] are higher than what they think, what
[72:50] they'll do is they'll dial up the
[72:52] difficulty of getting these these bills
[72:55] authorized. So there there's literally a
[72:58] dial or they're like make it harder or
[72:59] make it easier depending upon how's it
[73:01] how it's going. And so if you think
[73:03] about it, a lot of times the insurance
[73:04] company has to pre-authorize your
[73:06] procedure. So if you want to go get a
[73:08] knee replacement, it's a big procedure.
[73:10] The doctor has to fill out all this
[73:11] paperwork, has to submit it to the
[73:12] health plan, the health plan has to
[73:14] approve it before you can actually go
[73:15] and get your your knee replaced or
[73:17] whatever the big surgery is. And if they
[73:19] dial up the difficulty to do that, that
[73:21] means they're going to have less knee
[73:22] surgeries, which means that more money
[73:24] is flowing to the bottom line. And you
[73:27] know, again, it's just this ridiculous
[73:29] amount of perverse incentives within the
[73:31] system where they're actively working
[73:32] against you. And it's like you you get
[73:35] double screwed. You know, in year,
[73:37] they'll actually work against you to get
[73:39] your claims uh approved because they
[73:41] they want to maximize their their 15%
[73:44] that they have to allocate towards
[73:45] profit. Over the long term, they
[73:47] actually want to see your expenses go up
[73:49] because they can actually charge you
[73:51] more for that and they can make that 15%
[73:53] as a dollar amount bigger. And so you're
[73:55] screwed in the short term and you're
[73:56] screwed in the long term. And so all the
[73:58] incentives are are stacked up against
[74:00] you. You know, I think it's interesting
[74:02] when people have a big health care
[74:03] expense, what do they do? They say,
[74:04] "Well, now I have to go fight with my
[74:06] health insurance company to get these
[74:08] bills paid." What we want to do is like,
[74:11] "Hey, we want we I'm going to fight I'm
[74:13] going to fight with, you know, as a as a
[74:15] partner against the medical industrial
[74:17] complex with Crowd Health and the and
[74:19] the member to get their bills paid."
[74:21] like we're an ally with you as opposed
[74:23] to your enemy and the way the current
[74:25] system is is set up. And so I think
[74:27] that's a huge differentiator between,
[74:29] you know, how we operate and how health
[74:30] insurance. We have zero incentive to get
[74:33] a bill denied. Um we have all the
[74:36] incentive in the world. I mean, think
[74:37] about it. If one of our Bitcoin members
[74:39] got their bill denied, what would they
[74:40] do? They would go on Twitter or X and
[74:43] they would say, "Crowd Health denied my
[74:45] bill." You know, that would be a
[74:46] marketing disaster, right? There's no
[74:48] incentive for us to do that. we're gonna
[74:50] fight with you to get the bills paid as
[74:52] opposed to against you. So once you get
[74:54] to you you you preach this all day long,
[74:56] incentives are everything. So we have
[74:58] every incentive in the world to get you
[75:00] to help you get your bills paid. And
[75:02] that's why I think you know on Trust
[75:04] Pilot we're 4.8 and I think the other
[75:06] health insurance plans are somewhere
[75:07] between one and 1.3 out of five. So
[75:10] that's I think a big differentiator for
[75:12] us. Wow. Yeah. Well, that's fantastic,
[75:16] man. Wonderful to hear. All right.
[75:18] Anything else you want to tell us about
[75:19] what's coming up for Crowd Health?
[75:23] Man, we we've got uh a catastrophic plan
[75:26] that we're going to be launching here in
[75:27] the next couple of weeks. So, instead of
[75:29] that $500 initial commitment, we ask you
[75:32] to pay the first $15,000. And this is
[75:35] basically for people who are like,
[75:36] "Look, I just want help with the big
[75:38] stuff. I can take care of all the little
[75:40] stuff. Don't worry about the little
[75:41] stuff. I want to just need some help
[75:43] with the big stuff." And so, um, we're
[75:45] calling that crowd health black swan for
[75:47] those black swan events, um, that happen
[75:49] in in life. And so, for people who have,
[75:52] you know, some some, uh, Bitcoin stacked
[75:55] or some money in the bank and and want a
[75:57] significantly lower price for Crowd
[75:59] Health, then we're going to be offering
[76:01] that in the next couple of weeks, which
[76:02] we're excited about. Um, and then keep a
[76:05] lookout for, you know, some really cool
[76:06] stuff over the next quarter, which we'll
[76:08] we'll talk about more. Follow us on on X
