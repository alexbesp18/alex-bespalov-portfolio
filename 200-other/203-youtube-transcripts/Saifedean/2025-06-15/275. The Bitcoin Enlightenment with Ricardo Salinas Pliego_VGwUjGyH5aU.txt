[00:02] Hello and welcome to the Bitcoin
[00:03] Standard podcast. Our guests today are
[00:06] the co-authors of a new book published
[00:08] by my publishing house, The Safe House.
[00:11] And the book's called The Bitcoin
[00:12] Enlightenment. And the authors are
[00:15] Ricardo Selenas, whom you have may have
[00:17] heard of, one of the richest men in
[00:20] Mexico and one of the uh most diehard
[00:25] Bitcoiners in Mexico and the world,
[00:27] constantly telling the world about
[00:29] Bitcoin and about free markets. And as
[00:31] we learn in this book, it's something
[00:33] he's learned and uh acquired and
[00:37] inherited from generations of his family
[00:39] who have had uh their interest in uh
[00:42] hard money as we're going to be
[00:44] discussing. And we also have Daniel
[00:46] Jungan and Pascal Hooli, a Swiss
[00:49] economist and journal Swiss journalist
[00:53] who collaborated with uh Mr. telling us
[00:56] on this amazing book and I am very proud
[00:58] to be publishing it because I believe it
[01:00] combines
[01:02] uh a wonderful combination of the
[01:06] ancient wisdom of many generations of a
[01:10] successful family thinking about money
[01:13] and struggling with inflation and
[01:15] hyperinflation generation after
[01:17] generation. as well as the successful
[01:21] insight of a modern entrepreneur whose
[01:24] success has been absolutely outstanding.
[01:27] So you will learn a lot from this book
[01:30] and I'm very happy to be publishing it
[01:32] and very happy to be hosting you to
[01:34] discuss this book. So thank you for
[01:35] joining us gentlemen. Good to be here
[01:37] and it's a pleasure and an honor to be
[01:38] here with you today. Thank you. Thank
[01:40] you. Thank you. The pleasure is mine.
[01:42] Um, so Ricardo, let's begin by uh
[01:45] discussing uh your family's history with
[01:49] sound money. How did you get to learn
[01:52] about someone? Before you begin,
[01:53] actually before you begin, and I
[01:55] interrupt you, allow me to say that I
[01:57] had heard about your father before I had
[01:59] heard about you many, many years ago. I
[02:01] had read articles written by your father
[02:04] about sound money and hard money and the
[02:07] history of money in Mexico. I remember
[02:09] him. And when I first heard about you, I
[02:12] I noticed the similarity in the name and
[02:15] I looked it up and I realized, yep,
[02:16] that's his son. So, yeah, you come from
[02:19] a long pedigree of uh hard money uh in
[02:24] the family. So, tell us about it. Yeah,
[02:26] actually you must have heard from my dad
[02:28] because he was uh promoting for a long
[02:31] time his idea of a of a silver coin for
[02:34] for the people for Mexico. He he thought
[02:37] that um having a a silver coin with with
[02:42] no face value that would be revalued to
[02:45] market price as needed was the way to
[02:48] have a simple and effective savings
[02:52] account for uh unsophisticated people of
[02:56] which there are many in the world. So he
[02:58] spent a long time uh working on that
[03:00] track. Unfortunately, well, you know,
[03:04] coinage and currency is issued by the
[03:08] government. So, in my language, I call
[03:11] them goier nicolas, which means
[03:13] something like a caveman with a stick
[03:15] that beats you up if you don't do what
[03:18] he says. That's a goier Nicola. And of
[03:22] course, the government man and the
[03:25] government ideology will have none to do
[03:29] with a strong currency.
[03:31] because exactly what they need. The
[03:34] politics of of the business uh that they
[03:38] are in the politics of the fiat fraud is
[03:41] precisely that they steal people's money
[03:44] from their wallets without them even
[03:47] noticing or crying. So why would they
[03:50] promote hard money, you know? So anyway,
[03:52] and that's why you must have heard about
[03:54] my dad. But but the origin of the whole
[03:56] thing and is way back in the 70s. I I
[03:59] remember I remember actually well that
[04:02] day in in August of 71 when Nixon
[04:08] uh went off the gold standard for the
[04:11] dollar and that day uh my dad was very
[04:16] alarmed and um he talked to me about
[04:19] that. I was just 16 but man I could have
[04:22] understand it. And now, of course, in
[04:24] retrospect, when I see Nixon on TV and
[04:27] the things that he said that day, I
[04:29] mean, it's the epidome of
[04:33] cynicism, of lying and of just
[04:38] uh
[04:39] tricking
[04:41] everybody and all over the world about
[04:45] what that that really really meant. you
[04:47] know, the dollar was no longer uh the
[04:51] token that was redeemable for 32 ounces
[04:55] of gold. It ceased to happen. And now it
[04:58] was this paper token was redeemable for
[05:01] nothing. So that was really amazing. I
[05:04] mean, if it happened today, uh we'll
[05:08] probably laugh them out of the room, but
[05:10] this was 1971. This is a long time ago.
[05:13] Okay. So at at that time it was very
[05:17] confusing and and you know Nixon was
[05:19] there on TV saying that the US is the
[05:21] strongest economy in the world and the
[05:23] currency is a is a strongest the
[05:26] strongest currency in the world and and
[05:28] everything is okay. Yeah. Well, okay.
[05:31] What happened was the dollar was
[05:33] devalued in terms of gold and then that
[05:38] caused this whole new epo of
[05:41] inflation that was a worldwide
[05:44] phenomenon to different degrees, right?
[05:46] Because different economies uh
[05:49] were mishandled
[05:52] uh to a larger degree depending on the
[05:55] political circumstances. So what
[05:57] happened was that during the late '7s
[06:00] the economy in Mexico was badly
[06:02] mismanaged and it culminated in our
[06:05] devaluation of the peso against the
[06:07] dollar in 1982 and basically we were all
[06:11] broke. The whole country was broke. So
[06:14] the value of the dollar uh in peso terms
[06:18] went from 20 and ended up in 3,000. So
[06:22] that's a devaluation. When you live
[06:24] through that and you understand what it
[06:27] means for for people and for yourself
[06:29] and for businesses, you have a very
[06:32] different perspective of uh of what
[06:36] really of the importance of sound
[06:39] currency and sound money. So that's how
[06:42] I got started into the whole thing. And
[06:44] of course at that time there was no
[06:46] Bitcoin. There was only gold and silver.
[06:50] So uh we all became gold bugs.
[06:54] since the 70s and we did really well,
[06:56] you know, all the way up to the 80s and
[06:58] then really bad for 20 years and then
[07:01] really well for another 20 years. And as
[07:05] of 2013, I am officially a 80% Bitcoin,
[07:10] 20% gold guy.
[07:13] Um, I mean, people maybe more toxic than
[07:16] me would tell you to have fun staying
[07:18] 20% poor, but I'm not going to say that.
[07:24] Well, uh, okay. So, then tell us now
[07:27] about what was the the inspiration
[07:29] behind this book? How did this idea come
[07:31] about? We were I was doing an interview
[07:33] with um with Pascal and Dan and um we
[07:36] had a a very long conversation and so we
[07:39] got to talking about it. So they
[07:40] convinced me to spend some time on this
[07:43] and and you know frankly I do a lot of
[07:45] things but I don't do a lot of writing
[07:48] because you know I'm busy with stuff but
[07:51] I do have a lot of ideas and the my
[07:54] ideas have been published and then put
[07:57] on video and distributed in different
[07:59] ways. So that was kind of the groundwork
[08:01] for the book and then they did the hard
[08:05] job of putting it on paper. But yeah,
[08:08] this is a a nice book. Here it is. Huh?
[08:10] Look at that. And I love the
[08:14] cover. And I think they did a good job.
[08:17] Yes. It's available from the
[08:19] safehouse.com. I should have mentioned
[08:21] that earlier, but uh tell your all your
[08:23] friends and get copies. safehouse.com.
[08:26] Exactly. Good. Do you have a Kindle
[08:30] version? Yes. Good. I love the Kindle.
[08:34] Yes, there's an ebook and an audio book
[08:37] and a hard cover. So, uh Daniel, uh how
[08:42] how did you come across the idea for uh
[08:44] this book? What inspired it and what did
[08:46] you aim to do from writing it? Well,
[08:50] maybe I need to go back a little bit. Um
[08:53] because in 2019, 2020, Pascal and I, we
[08:57] were uh working as cryptojournalists,
[09:00] content creators. uh we were writing
[09:03] about Bitcoin and what was going on in
[09:05] the crypto space back then for different
[09:07] companies and uh during that time
[09:11] uh we uh came across a book that's
[09:13] called the sovereign individual. Most
[09:16] listeners have probably heard about that
[09:19] and the book predicts um a shift of
[09:24] power from the governments, nation
[09:27] states to the individuals because um
[09:30] technology is
[09:32] progressing and uh it basically I would
[09:35] say describes what we nowadays maybe
[09:38] call digital nomads. Um people that can
[09:41] work from anywhere, they can live
[09:43] anywhere. Um, and because of that, if
[09:47] they don't like what the government is
[09:48] doing, they can actually opt out and
[09:50] move to a different country. And so that
[09:52] gives them a lot more freedom. And
[09:55] Pascal and I were reading that book and
[09:57] we really liked it. And shortly after
[10:00] that, the second COVID wave hit Europe
[10:04] and with it all the restrictions came
[10:06] back, the lockdowns came back and of
[10:08] course we didn't like it. So, uh, we
[10:11] were looking for places to go to, um,
[10:14] countries that were not that, uh,
[10:17] restrictive and we found
[10:19] Mexico and Mexico would still allow you
[10:22] to travel and, uh, so we discussed the
[10:25] idea of going to Mexico for two reasons.
[10:28] First of all, to get a uh, feeling of
[10:31] how it is to be a digital nomad, to work
[10:34] from there. um what it means to be a
[10:37] sovereign individual, go to another
[10:39] country because you don't like what your
[10:41] government at home is doing. And the
[10:44] second reason was
[10:46] um we wanted to see how uh Bitcoin and
[10:50] stable coins were influencing Latin
[10:52] America. We're very interested in that
[10:55] because we had heard a lot of stories
[10:57] how um Bitcoin would help to bank the
[11:01] unbanked or how it would help to
[11:04] escape escape people from their local
[11:07] currency from inflation. Um so we wanted
[11:10] to see if that's actually true. And so
[11:12] when coming to Mexico uh we started
[11:15] reaching out to people asking for
[11:16] interviews because we wanted to know
[11:18] what's going on on on the ground in
[11:20] these countries. And uh one of the one
[11:23] of the places we asked for an interview
[11:25] was with the group Alenas
[11:28] um because we have heard that Ricardo is
[11:30] very outspoken about Bitcoin. So we
[11:32] wanted to hear his take on Bitcoin and
[11:35] what's going on in Mexico and if Bitcoin
[11:37] is making a difference in
[11:39] Mexico. And maybe maybe Posal you can
[11:42] take over from here because it was
[11:43] actually your idea to contact Ricardo.

[12:57] I love to work early in the morning and
[12:59] late at night or in the sun outdoors,
[13:01] but regular computer screens are
[13:02] terrible at these times and they strain
[13:04] your eyes. For years, I've wanted a
[13:06] paper-like electronic screen on a simple
[13:09] computer I could use to write. I tried
[13:11] several models, but none were very good.
[13:14] Now, finally, Daylight have delivered a
[13:17] fantastic full function tablet with a
[13:19] paper-like screen that's easy on your
[13:21] eyes and great for outdoor use. I've
[13:24] been using the Daylight computer to
[13:25] write my next book, and it is absolutely
[13:27] fantastic, and it has led me to invest
[13:30] in this company myself. Check out my
[13:32] interview with Anjan Kata in episode
[13:34] 249.
[13:36] No, it's really funny because when we
[13:38] were looking when we got to Mexico, we
[13:40] were looking we're googling like what
[13:41] are the most interesting people in
[13:43] Bitcoin in Mexico and obviously Ricardo
[13:45] came up and and then we were really
[13:47] intrigued by by the story that we read
[13:49] online and the interviews that we
[13:51] watched and that's why we we reached out
[13:53] to group of Selenas and asked for the
[13:55] interview and all of a sudden we found
[13:57] ourselves at the headquarters of group
[13:58] of salenos at theatka and we were doing
[14:01] this interview and again while we did
[14:03] this interview it was so fascinating and
[14:06] intriguing to to hear Ricardo's story
[14:08] and also the way he he was his sharpness
[14:12] and and sort of the the the
[14:14] philosophical underpinnings of his
[14:15] understanding of the world and Bitcoin
[14:17] and so we were like wow this usually
[14:20] doesn't happen with with successful be
[14:22] business people like like him you know
[14:24] they they are sort of in the daily works
[14:27] and have to care about all the companies
[14:29] that they have so they have no time to
[14:31] spend on these sorts of topics but with
[14:33] Ricardo was different and that's why we
[14:35] were
[14:36] um um coming up with this idea of the
[14:38] book and we reached out as Ricardo said
[14:40] himself already and this is how the book
[14:42] came about and we really wanted to get
[14:44] his ideas across. Uh we were fascinated
[14:46] by this uh slogan Deroto Falso that we
[14:50] heard in that interview many times over
[14:52] and so maybe uh Ricardo you can talk to
[14:54] this as well what you actually meant and
[14:56] said during the interview with Dero
[14:58] Falso because what it means really is
[15:02] fiat fraud. No, these tokens are
[15:04] nothing. I'm I'm saying tokens because
[15:06] in the Bitcoin world, we understand that
[15:08] there's different crypto tokens and they
[15:11] have different characteristics and
[15:13] they're on a on a blockchain and then
[15:15] you can do things with them. But at the
[15:17] end of the day, it's just a a
[15:19] representation of something that you can
[15:21] trade for for something else. So, as I
[15:23] said before, the
[15:25] original emergence of paper money was a
[15:28] great innovation. It was needed for
[15:30] trade. It was very important. But it it
[15:33] meant that you were carrying these piece
[15:35] of paper that could be this token that
[15:37] could be exchanged for currency, for
[15:41] coins, for silver, for gold. And it was
[15:44] very practical to be able to travel from
[15:47] one place to another with a piece of
[15:48] paper as opposed to with a bag of gold,
[15:50] right? But what kind of utility would it
[15:54] have if this paper was traded for for
[15:56] nothing, you know? I mean it's really
[15:59] astounding that people across the world
[16:03] in all the
[16:05] countries have fallen under this spell
[16:08] you know of central banks
[16:11] and tokens without any backing at
[16:16] all. So of course because they cannot be
[16:20] traded for anything then there's no
[16:21] limit to the supply that it can be
[16:23] produced. So you have to bust your ass
[16:26] to work and get some money. But these
[16:28] people, they just push a button and they
[16:30] create the money out of nothing. I mean,
[16:32] this is really amazing. How can people
[16:35] stand up for that, you know? And I'm a
[16:37] banker. I know a thing or two about
[16:38] that.
[16:42] Yeah. Well, in your book, uh, you get
[16:46] into the history of fiat money and one
[16:49] found one part that I found very
[16:50] interesting is the emergence of the bond
[16:52] market and the role that the Bank of
[16:55] England played and how this was the road
[16:59] to inflation. And this is something that
[17:02] I think most people don't really
[17:03] understand um because they don't really
[17:07] uh the bond market just looks
[17:10] complicated and it disguises what's
[17:12] going on. So tell us to Ricardo, what
[17:17] was the story of the bond market?
[17:20] The bond market. Well, you know,
[17:23] governments have this
[17:26] perpetual deficit. They are a perpetual
[17:29] spending machine and this all the
[17:32] governments in the world run across the
[17:35] same path which is spend spend spend.
[17:39] Some of them spend it in wars and some
[17:41] of them spend it in the in welfare and
[17:45] some of them spend it in personal
[17:47] benefit for the members of the
[17:49] government. But
[17:51] spend till you're dead. But before
[17:54] you're dead, you have to be creative,
[17:58] you know, so not to lose the this
[18:01] ridiculous privilege and you can spend
[18:04] money if you tax it, but then people
[18:06] complain. People don't like to be taxed
[18:09] and there's a lot of complaining to be
[18:11] done. So the better idea is to
[18:16] borrow. So bonds are just a form of
[18:19] borrowing. You issue a bond means you
[18:22] borrowed money from people and but even
[18:25] the terminology is very tricky you know
[18:26] just people say I buy bonds you're not
[18:28] buying nothing you're lending money to
[18:31] whoever issued the bond
[18:34] to and when central banks found out or
[18:39] maybe governments found out that the
[18:41] treasury could borrow in the public
[18:44] market through issuing bonds then ah
[18:48] this is cool but then again you hit a
[18:50] limit and the interest rates start to go
[18:53] up. Ah, enter the central banks. Great.
[18:57] So, the central bank buys bond at an
[19:01] artificially low interest rate. And who
[19:03] benefit from the low interest rate? Of
[19:06] course, the issuer of the bond, which is
[19:08] the government that's running the
[19:09] country. So the government gets to
[19:12] borrow some money from the central bank
[19:15] at an artificial low interest rate and
[19:19] no
[19:21] problem until we find out that the
[19:23] central bank has no capital, no money to
[19:26] lend. They just fabricated out of thin
[19:29] air. So that's that's a cool trick about
[19:32] bonds and um what had h what has
[19:37] happened in the western world and you
[19:40] know with the Fed in the States with the
[19:42] European Central Bank with the Japanese
[19:44] central bank with the United Kingdom
[19:47] central bank and Canadian all the
[19:50] central banks in the past five years
[19:52] have issued an enormous amount of
[19:56] debt which had no backing. It has been
[20:00] fabricated out of thin
[20:02] air and the result is galloping
[20:07] inflation translated into asset prices
[20:10] and then they the governments are very
[20:13] smart. I mean the people in the
[20:15] government are not stupid, you know. So
[20:16] they have this thing called the CPI in
[20:18] the consumer price indic. Oh no,
[20:20] inflation is tame. Tame. Sure. They
[20:24] wouldn't be publishing that thing. But
[20:27] then how come asset prices have gone
[20:29] through the roof? Why are houses uh now
[20:32] you know the average house is I don't
[20:34] know what 200,000 $400,000 in the US. It
[20:37] used to be 15,000 you know a couple
[20:39] years ago. and cars are 100 plus
[20:42] thousand. They used to be 20,000. Oh,
[20:45] but the CPI doesn't say that. So, it's
[20:48] it's just a a tremendous construct by
[20:52] these people in power to
[20:55] separate people from their money to
[20:58] separate the hardearned money of the
[21:00] people and to put it into their coffers
[21:03] so that they can continue on this
[21:05] unabated spending spree. So that is why
[21:09] I have a very dim view of bonds and in
[21:12] my opinion anybody who buys a bond needs
[21:15] to have his brain
[21:17] examined. Yeah. Because it's absolutely
[21:21] the worst proposition
[21:23] ever. But you know amazingly uh again
[21:27] governments are very smart. So there's
[21:28] other institutions like pension funds
[21:30] which are mandated by government to
[21:32] exist and
[21:34] then the m the pension funds are
[21:37] mandated by government to buy the bonds.
[21:39] So then they
[21:41] can
[21:44] say they can extract the money from the
[21:47] pensioners. And of course the guys who
[21:50] are worst off in in an inflationary
[21:53] environment are people on a fixed income
[21:56] mainly
[21:58] pensioners. But we see a lot of old poor
[22:02] people because their pension funds have
[22:04] been buying bonds you know. So I think I
[22:06] would call it the the biggest ripoff of
[22:09] all times, the bond market.
[22:13] Yes. Yeah, that's that's true. And I
[22:14] mean maybe I can add some thoughts here
[22:16] as well to what Ricardo said. I mean um
[22:19] everything that he was saying we we we
[22:21] described in more detail in the book and
[22:23] maybe going back to this establishment
[22:25] of the Bank of England which is really
[22:26] like the father of all central banks you
[22:29] know and if you really leap read between
[22:31] the lines that's so interesting because
[22:33] nowadays when we talk about central
[22:36] banks and all the economists at the
[22:38] governmentr run universities they're
[22:40] sort of saying yeah the central banks
[22:41] are here to help the economy to
[22:44] administer to manage the economy but if
[22:46] you read back Then it was really just to
[22:49] finance wars, you know, was back then
[22:51] when the English king wanted to raise
[22:53] money against in his war against the
[22:55] French people and and that's why he he
[22:57] had to turn to something like the
[23:00] central bank like the Bank of England
[23:02] that was founded by a Scottish
[23:04] businessman also William Patterson who
[23:06] had this idea and it was really that uh
[23:09] they collaborated also sort of with the
[23:11] private sides that they just allowed
[23:13] them to engage in this privilege as well
[23:16] of of printing money. So they would uh
[23:19] go out um um print uh money and have
[23:23] this uh distribute to people who would
[23:25] then deposit their precious gold at this
[23:28] bank which was also called the
[23:29] revolutionary bank in the beginning. And
[23:32] that's really how they raised all the
[23:34] money, the real money, the gold from all
[23:35] these people that they that then was
[23:38] lent on or given on to the the
[23:40] government that was then able to finance
[23:42] its wars. And that's really how it
[23:44] started. And um yeah, the Bank of
[23:46] England became like the poster child and
[23:49] really the example for all the other
[23:50] central banks. And out of then then also
[23:53] the go government bond market um
[23:55] developed because as as we were saying
[23:58] as well before it was really before this
[24:01] was established, the kings had to go out
[24:03] to rich families and other people,
[24:05] private people to raise money for wars,
[24:08] you know, uh through through taxes or
[24:09] then also borrow by by them loaning to
[24:12] them. And this way it came more
[24:14] anonymized, you know, because then you
[24:16] could just turn these loans into public
[24:18] debt sort of and you wrote and you you
[24:20] you you got the money, you borrowed it
[24:22] from the entire uh sort of um populace
[24:26] that you had in your country. And this
[24:28] was just perfected. It was established
[24:30] in the 17th century and then over the
[24:33] 18th and 19th century it was just
[24:35] perfected uh by really
[24:37] institutionalizing this coupling it to
[24:40] sort of a public currency as well and
[24:43] there uh from there yeah the the whole
[24:45] disaster sort of unfolded and that's
[24:47] what we discuss in in the book in in
[24:50] great detail as well. If I might add
[24:53] something
[24:54] there, which I find that very few people
[24:57] talk about is you mentioned um Pascal
[25:00] that the the king or the government was
[25:04] now able to borrow from the population
[25:06] to finance his wars from the population
[25:09] in his country. Well, yes, but you know,
[25:12] it's not exactly correct. He's borrowing
[25:15] not only from the population in his
[25:17] country, but from all the ones that have
[25:19] not been born.
[25:21] So for all those of you who have this
[25:23] democratic
[25:25] instinct and at the end of the day you
[25:27] can say well the people voted for this
[25:30] is this what they got? No sir. When
[25:32] we're talking about public
[25:33] debt there's plenty of damaged people
[25:36] who did not vote meaning all the
[25:39] underage people who didn't vote and all
[25:42] the unborn people who are not around
[25:44] with us and who are going to have to
[25:46] stay around to pay for the goddamn debt
[25:48] forever and ever and ever and ever. So
[25:50] it is really a a very pernitious policy
[25:56] this government debt issuance and um it
[26:00] it it does what I call it it breaks the
[26:03] intergenerational pact. The
[26:05] intergenerational pact is I will try to
[26:09] leave a better world for my children
[26:12] than I got from my
[26:14] parents and that is how human progress
[26:16] is done you know but no now we brought
[26:19] the intergenerational
[26:21] part and like uh the famous we the 14th
[26:25] saying after
[26:27] me the lu
[26:30] the hell with it so it's a very
[26:32] irresponsible policy that we're seeing
[26:34] across the world, not only in the United
[26:36] States, all over the world is the same
[26:38] problem. what Ricardo just reiterated,
[26:40] we also had this really summed up in
[26:42] this one sentence that we had in the
[26:43] book that we said with the establishment
[26:46] of the Bank of England, the first
[26:47] central bank, it was really this
[26:49] monetary sin that humans created so to
[26:52] say and and this suddenly suddenly
[26:55] eroded the foundations of the democra
[26:57] democratic state along with its legal,
[26:59] institutional and political structures,
[27:01] you know, and and as he just described,
[27:03] many people nowadays don't see this, but
[27:05] it's so interwoven and it's actually all
[27:07] going back to this creation of this of
[27:09] this uh fiat institution called the
[27:12] central bank. There's there's a certain
[27:14] innovation you know because remember
[27:17] first we had to carry coins in the bag
[27:18] and it was very difficult for commerce.
[27:21] Then we invented the the bills of
[27:23] exchange and then it it got perfected
[27:26] but into paper bills, you know, that
[27:31] were standardized issued and people
[27:34] would accept them because the token was
[27:37] backed by some redeemable amount of of
[27:40] gold or silver and and I think those are
[27:43] are great innovations. You know, you
[27:45] need that kind of thing to have a a
[27:47] prosperous modern economy.
[27:51] Then well the first problem was this
[27:54] delinking of the of the paper bill from
[27:58] the redeemable
[28:00] uh it lost its its uh redeemable factor
[28:05] right it was gone. So now it's
[28:07] nothing and then you know with
[28:10] technology and computers we became used
[28:12] to digits. So now we don't even need
[28:14] paper money. We we laugh at that and and
[28:17] we see our whole wealth in the palm of
[28:19] our hand in our in our phone. It says
[28:21] you got so much Apple stock and it's
[28:23] worth so much and you got so much you
[28:25] know Facebook and it worth so much and
[28:28] and and we're very happy with these
[28:30] digits that appear on our screen. But
[28:33] bottom line
[28:35] is these
[28:37] tokens in order to be useful they need
[28:41] to be exchanged for something
[28:43] real
[28:46] and the the abuse in the issuance of
[28:51] tokens leads to very bad things. For
[28:54] example, you know, we have this this
[28:55] discussion going on in the world now
[28:57] about Tether. you know this USDT which
[29:00] is a token which is redeemable for
[29:02] dollars and the people of Tether have
[29:05] done a great job. They're very smart
[29:06] people and they take dollars and they
[29:09] have it in very liquid form and they
[29:12] issue tokens that are put on a
[29:14] blockchain and those tokens of USDT will
[29:17] be redeemed one for one for dollars.
[29:20] Well, but my friends at Tether will
[29:23] never go on TV and say, "Oh, we're
[29:25] leaving the convertibility and now you
[29:27] can just trade the
[29:29] Tethers." We have to kill them all and
[29:32] put them in jail. Huh? So, they would
[29:33] never do that because this is a
[29:35] onetoone guaranteed token, right? Uh
[29:38] well, but the government is not
[29:40] constrained by that. They can issue all
[29:42] the money and all the tokens they want
[29:44] with no compunction and no shame. You
[29:48] know, this is plain robbery in plain
[29:52] sight.

[31:23] Yeah, I think an an enormous part of
[31:26] this rests on the idea that um you need
[31:30] to have this game of uh governments and
[31:34] banks buying bonds as you describe it.
[31:38] You have a nice graphic that explains it
[31:39] where the government gives the banks the
[31:43] license to
[31:45] basically make money out of thin air and
[31:49] in exchange the governments the banks
[31:52] use their depositor's savings in order
[31:56] to buy the government's bonds
[31:59] effectively lending the entire nation's
[32:02] wealth to the government. And so it's a
[32:06] wonderful deal for both of them at the
[32:09] expense of everybody else. So if you
[32:11] don't happen to be one of uh them, then
[32:14] this is a terrible deal for you. But if
[32:16] you are one of them, you know,
[32:17] congratulations. You made it. And let me
[32:20] add to that. There's two things there.
[32:22] Well, the central bank has the capacity
[32:24] to lend money that doesn't exist. They
[32:28] just fabricate it out of thin air. Okay?
[32:32] commercial banks, they have the capacity
[32:34] to use other people's money, their
[32:37] depositor's money to make loans, which
[32:40] is different. You cannot just fabricate
[32:42] it. You have to have some deposits in
[32:45] there. And then because of fractional
[32:47] reserves and so forth, there's a
[32:49] multiplying effect in the system. But
[32:51] but the point
[32:52] is there's another original sin which I
[32:55] I don't think we've covered yet.
[32:57] But yeah, it's called uh borrowing uh
[33:01] short and lending long. And this is
[33:03] something that was that was also very uh
[33:06] uh problematic in 18th century and 19th
[33:10] century England. There's a fantastic
[33:12] book called Lombard Street and how the
[33:17] the financial system of those years was
[33:21] constantly overextending in longerterm
[33:23] loans. assets were at long term and then
[33:28] the liabilities were at short term. So
[33:30] if any scare or any problem happened,
[33:34] the depositors will go to the banking
[33:36] system say give me my money. And the
[33:38] banking system say I'm sorry I lent it
[33:40] to such and such venture or we made a
[33:43] house or or or we finance some trade and
[33:47] you know then the whole discussion about
[33:48] oh it's not that we're broke. It's not
[33:51] that we're broke because we have assets.
[33:54] No, it's just that we don't have the
[33:55] money to pay you out, which is they call
[33:58] it
[34:00] illi liquidity instead of insolvent.
[34:02] It's the same you know? They can't
[34:04] pay, can't pay, can't pay. So, that's
[34:08] another function of the central bank.
[34:10] They step in as a lender of last resort.
[34:13] They fabricate money to bail out the
[34:16] bankers from their previous mistakes. So
[34:20] all of this of course has cost and it
[34:23] all is
[34:24] trans transported or or transl
[34:27] translated into into less purchasing
[34:30] power for the currency which for which
[34:33] all the people in the country pay for.
[34:35] Yeah I think safe um the this the
[34:38] elusive schematic that you were
[34:40] referring to I think is really the one
[34:41] that maybe we can show it also in the in
[34:44] in in the show notes or something. It's
[34:46] really that treasury issues and sells
[34:48] government bonds. This is what it does.
[34:50] You know, the treasury of any
[34:51] government. And then you have banks who
[34:53] buy these government bonds as you
[34:55] already said with the money of their
[34:56] depositors. And then these same banks
[34:59] can also use these government bonds
[35:00] again to get to central bank to go to
[35:03] central banks and get more reserves in
[35:05] exchange. And with these reserves, these
[35:08] reserves allow to allow the banks to buy
[35:10] the government bonds again. And so we
[35:12] have this sort of vicious cycle. Maybe
[35:14] it's a little bit uh shortsighted here,
[35:16] but still it gets the the main idea
[35:18] across that it's really this J kiting
[35:21] scheme that's going on. And we really
[35:23] refer here to a term which was also used
[35:26] by this monetary economist Antalite
[35:29] which I think again was a great friend
[35:30] of of Ricardo's father and probably of
[35:32] Ricardo as well. And so uh he described
[35:35] this for the first time where I actually
[35:37] read this and I was really convinced
[35:38] that this is just as I said a a check
[35:41] guiding scheme that's going on and is
[35:43] sort of just as I said an elusive
[35:46] schematic that doesn't add up in the
[35:48] end. Well Ricardo I'm wondering what is
[35:52] your explanation for why fiat money has
[35:56] survived for as long as it has? I think
[35:59] uh people like your father and your
[36:01] grandfather would have expected that
[36:02] this would have uh ended in disaster. I
[36:06] guess one way to answer that would be
[36:08] that it it has ended many many times and
[36:11] you know you particularly in a place
[36:12] like Mexico you've had many currencies
[36:15] die. So you've been vindicated many
[36:18] times but they keep rising from the dead
[36:22] and some of them don't even die when
[36:24] they die you know they bleed slowly. So
[36:27] how do we fix that and what explains
[36:29] that? On the one hand, the driving force
[36:34] is the in inextricable link between big
[36:38] government, big spending and fiat money.
[36:41] I mean it has to be like that. You
[36:44] cannot have it another way. So that's
[36:47] one factor. Okay. But the other thing
[36:50] the other thing that we usually don't
[36:52] talk about is that it's also very
[36:54] convenient to have you know these digits
[36:58] on computers that can fly across the
[37:00] world and transfer value from here to
[37:02] there and uh it's very convenient to be
[37:04] able to
[37:05] issue to borrow on the on the
[37:08] international markets for corporate
[37:10] developments and also the government. So
[37:13] it's convenient to have debt. Now, I'm a
[37:17] big user of debt and I've had my share
[37:19] of uh scrapes with that because when you
[37:22] when you take uh on debt, you're also
[37:25] increasing the risk of the whole
[37:27] venture. And when the whole system as as
[37:30] a whole is heavily indebted, the risk of
[37:34] the system blowing up goes up. So again,
[37:37] you know, this is a thing of human
[37:38] nature. I mean, humans, we live, we were
[37:41] born, we're we're children, we get
[37:43] educated, we get middle of life, and
[37:46] then we die, and everything that we
[37:48] learn, we forget because we're dead. But
[37:50] there's new generations showing up, and
[37:53] they are not necessarily on the same
[37:55] place in the learning curve as the rest
[37:58] of us. So, a younger world will be a
[38:02] more ignorant world, you know. So, there
[38:04] you have it. So there several things but
[38:07] it's at bottom line is that we're in a
[38:10] world of big government big spending and
[38:14] it needs to have this fiat fraud in
[38:17] order to sustain itself. Let me just add
[38:20] to this again. I mean there's one idea
[38:22] that we describe in the book is also
[38:24] that they always have another trick up
[38:26] their sleeves. you know, as you said,
[38:28] safe. I mean, the system would have
[38:29] collapsed maybe many times, but then uh
[38:32] and some people have done this before.
[38:33] They describe the Federal Reserve really
[38:36] as the department of acronyms, you know.
[38:38] So, whenever there is a crisis, they're
[38:40] never short of an acronym that can come
[38:41] up come up with another sort of acronym.
[38:44] Nobody understands what it is, but it's
[38:46] just a way to bail out the system. And
[38:48] and I think that's probably yeah, why
[38:50] they have so many more tricks up their
[38:52] sleeves. Uh and as Ricardo said, it's
[38:54] also the this conglomerate of of private
[38:57] interest of of of big interest of
[38:59] corporation, corporatism of what it's
[39:01] called. And so that's why it has never
[39:03] ended. And and and that's really the
[39:05] question is it ever going to end or
[39:07] don't we have to opt out uh by by going
[39:10] into Bitcoin? And that's something that
[39:11] we describe in the book as well. I think
[39:14] that this opens up a whole new ball game
[39:16] and that's why we're so optimistic and
[39:18] and Bitcoin is now in the stage of being
[39:21] revalued to its actual usefulness for
[39:25] the world. It started at nothing and
[39:28] it's been moving up and up and up and
[39:30] people con constantly say, well, how how
[39:32] high is he going to be up? How high is
[39:34] it going to go? And
[39:36] well, depends. The more people find it
[39:38] useful, the more valuable it's going to
[39:41] be. So, but but at the end of the day,
[39:44] we should all get used to thinking that
[39:46] it's it's in Bitcoin terms that we need
[39:49] to think and not in dollar terms or peso
[39:52] terms or eo terms and that's that. And
[39:56] the the faster we get to that
[39:57] realization, the better we will be off,
[40:00] you know. Yeah. I I really like what you
[40:02] said before that um the next generation
[40:04] has to relearn certain things. So when
[40:07] we interviewed you first
[40:10] um you used very strong language um when
[40:14] describing the uh fiat system like like
[40:17] we discussed before you call it the
[40:19] fraud the narrow fall. So and um after
[40:23] studying that interview again I realized
[40:27] that the your voice is a v a wakeup call
[40:30] for the next generation to not make the
[40:32] same mistake again. Um, and I or Pascal
[40:36] and I, we really like that that you are
[40:39] a voice not only for the Bitcoin
[40:42] community, but al but also for like all
[40:44] the people that follow you, also the
[40:46] people that follow you because of your
[40:48] business ventures and entrepreneurial
[40:50] spirit.
[40:52] Um, you you wake the people up to what's
[40:55] going on and I think that's super
[40:57] important. And we also try to capture
[40:59] this wakeup call in I think in one of
[41:02] the first chapters, chapter two, where
[41:04] we try to uh list all these lies that we
[41:08] believe about fiat money and um yeah, I
[41:12] think it's super important to wake up
[41:13] the next generation to what's going on.
[41:15] So what you're doing with being
[41:17] outspoken about that is super important.
[41:20] Thank you. Yeah, it's really very
[41:22] valuable that um we we've gotten
[41:26] billionaires on team Bitcoin because uh
[41:29] it makes it very hard to offer the usual
[41:32] kind of criticism which is haha this is
[41:34] just a bunch of loser nerd libertarians
[41:37] who are trying to scam the world because
[41:41] when you know people like Michael Sailor
[41:44] and Ricardo Selena show up it makes it
[41:46] very hard to uh make that argument.
[41:51] And it's uh you know no joking it's it's
[41:54] enormously influential because young
[41:56] people look up to figures like you and
[41:59] uh in many cases unfortunately people in
[42:02] those figures get uh tempted to uh use
[42:06] their
[42:08] uh their platforms to appeal to what
[42:12] people want to hear. And it's uh it's
[42:15] it's sad because it's destructive. It's
[42:18] damaging and uh it's
[42:22] uh it's it's terrible for the people
[42:24] that uh listen to it. You know, uh you
[42:27] see all of this concern about things
[42:29] like climate change and inequality and
[42:32] uh
[42:34] uh having government provide for people.
[42:37] You see a lot of rich people go down the
[42:39] path of doing this because it is the
[42:41] easier way. It's more popular. it's
[42:42] going to get you more uh credit from
[42:46] people and also it's uh better uh for
[42:53] manipulating people. You know, generally
[42:56] uh you can use this kind of uh uh
[42:58] rhetoric in order to get more government
[43:02] intervention which you could then use to
[43:03] your benefit. And that's what usually
[43:05] motivates this. There's always the uh
[43:08] fancy rhetoric of we're doing this to
[43:10] save the world, but in reality, people
[43:13] benefit from it. And yet, you're out
[43:15] there telling people to basically just
[43:19] uh go out there, depend on themselves,
[43:21] be productive, don't count on
[43:22] government. It's very valuable. Thank
[43:24] you for that. Healthcare is one of the
[43:26] biggest problems in fiat world and
[43:28] health insurance in particular. In my
[43:30] work and on this podcast, we've

[44:27] and use the code safe. S A I F. Yeah.
[44:31] Well, I I think you know that's why for
[44:33] me the the the the combination of a a
[44:38] social and political uh view of things
[44:41] and Bitcoin is totally complimentary.
[44:45] Now, I'm a libertarian. I'm a Randian.
[44:48] You know, I've been around for a long
[44:50] time. I'm starch anti-communist,
[44:53] antis-ocialist,
[44:55] anti-colctivist, you know, and all those
[44:59] uh
[45:01] philosophies lead to destruction. You
[45:03] know, I'm a firm believer that the
[45:04] philosophy of freedom and and individual
[45:08] choice is the way to go. And and
[45:11] because, you know, my usual speech,
[45:13] because you're free, then you can act
[45:16] and you can act with innovation. And
[45:19] innovation creates either something for
[45:22] the better or for the worse. If it's for
[45:24] the worse, it dies. If it's for the
[45:25] better, it stays. And we're all better
[45:28] off because of the innovation. And then
[45:30] because of the innovation, it attracts
[45:31] competition. And competition makes more
[45:34] of that and even better. And that is how
[45:36] you raise human progress. It re it ends
[45:39] up with prosperity for everybody. And
[45:41] that's what's happened in the world for
[45:43] the past two or 30 hund years since the
[45:45] industrial revolution and the liberal u
[45:49] uh philosophical dominance that we used
[45:52] to have.
[45:55] Unfortunately, there's a counterurrent
[45:57] to all of that comes from the left wing
[46:01] which is anti-freedom. It means slavery.
[46:04] People are now supposed to follow orders
[46:07] and not ask questions. and everybody has
[46:10] a spot in the world and that's where
[46:12] you're going to be. Don't discuss you're
[46:14] a slave. And then slavery, how can
[46:16] slavery result in innovation? It's
[46:18] impossible. And people will do exactly
[46:20] the same what they're told and maybe not
[46:23] even that because it's boring. And that
[46:25] will not have competition. You will have
[46:27] monopolies of government monopolies
[46:29] which as we know are terribly
[46:31] inefficient and corrupt. And what does
[46:33] that lead to? Misery. So what we need is
[46:36] you know a very simple philosophy. I
[46:39] tried to tell that to young people. What
[46:41] side are you going to be on? The side of
[46:44] the right, which is freedom, or the side
[46:46] of the left, which is slavery? And by
[46:49] the way, if you're on the right, you
[46:50] should be on Bitcoin. Excellent. Okay.
[46:53] And um what what are your uh thoughts on
[46:57] economics in general?
[46:59] Um what where do you see things going
[47:01] and what kind of uh advice given the way
[47:04] that the world economy is going now?
[47:06] What kind of advice would you offer to
[47:08] younger people? young entrepreneurs,
[47:09] people in their 20s who want to be where
[47:11] you are um in the next 20 years or 30
[47:14] years. Given where the world is going,
[47:17] what do you suggest? Is it just sell
[47:20] everything and buy Bitcoin at this point
[47:21] or uh I I think that's a very important
[47:23] question. I'm glad you asked it. So,
[47:26] we've been we speak of Bitcoin a lot in
[47:28] in terms of investment. So when you have
[47:31] produced enough surplus through the
[47:34] activities in your life and then you
[47:37] have to think about investments that's
[47:39] when the option of bitcoin is so clear
[47:43] instead of buying stocks and bonds and
[47:46] real estate and I don't know art jewels
[47:50] gold you can buy bitcoin this is a
[47:53] completely new alternative asset class
[47:56] for the investment world but you know in
[47:58] order to be in the investment world, you
[48:00] have to have some money to invest. And
[48:02] to get that money, first you have to
[48:04] work your butt off, you know. So you
[48:06] young people should
[48:09] think in in terms of where can they be
[48:12] more successful because obviously if you
[48:15] live in a in a backward country in
[48:19] Africa, you don't have the same
[48:21] opportunities, right? If you live in
[48:23] Mexico City or you live in in
[48:26] Switzerland or wherever, there's
[48:28] different opportunities in different
[48:30] places. And that is why it's so
[48:32] disappointing to see what's happening in
[48:34] Europe because there's lots of young
[48:36] people that are well educated and they
[48:38] can't do nothing. They can't do nothing
[48:40] because everything is forbidden and
[48:43] everything is regulated. So my
[48:46] suggestion for young people is to move
[48:48] their butt off to some place where they
[48:51] can actually do
[48:52] something without being put in jail for
[48:55] violating some regulation or another.
[48:58] And it's not an easy thing, you know,
[49:01] and that's why the idea of the digital
[49:03] nomad is not bad. You can go around and
[49:05] figure it out. Um most places they have
[49:09] lots of regulations, but then they're
[49:10] ineffective and they're not enforced. So
[49:13] you can actually do things and so people
[49:17] should who want to get rich you know you
[49:20] can only get rich if you do something
[49:22] for other people so that they give them
[49:25] they the other people
[49:27] give you money that's the way to get
[49:31] rich if I'm rich it's because I've done
[49:33] a lot of things for millions of people
[49:35] like what like selling them motorcycles
[49:37] like selling them televisions and then
[49:39] making them loans and then giving them
[49:41] internet service They give me money for
[49:43] all of those things and that's why I'm
[49:46] rich and successful. So what can you do
[49:49] for millions of
[49:51] people? That's how to get rich. And once
[49:54] you get rich and you have some excess
[49:56] funds, buy Bitcoin. I I I mean we also
[49:59] we also talked about this in the book,
[50:01] you know, this very question between
[50:03] sort of um should we invest in Bitcoin
[50:06] or should we do something else? And I
[50:08] think uh we tackled this question the
[50:10] way with the we borrowed the words uh of
[50:12] the wise Muhammad Gandhi when he wrote
[50:15] those who hold Bitcoin are the change
[50:17] they want to see in this world you know
[50:19] and I think that's really what we're
[50:20] seeing right now that Bitcoin the world
[50:22] in and of itself offers so many
[50:24] opportunities also when it comes to
[50:26] being an entrepreneur because there's a
[50:28] new system being built there. It also a
[50:32] way that it instills a new sense of
[50:34] excitement in all these people and yeah
[50:36] it's not only about gaining wealth that
[50:39] makes you influential but you you're
[50:41] gaining recognition by by being in the
[50:43] Bitcoin ecosystem and all of a sudden
[50:45] you find yourself among the movers and
[50:47] shakers of this world just because
[50:49] Bitcoin itself is growing in relevance
[50:52] and so this is really something that
[50:54] what that we're seeing uh right now in
[50:56] the world you know because like the
[50:57] social impact that Bitcoin can have for
[51:00] countries for politicians like Trump who
[51:02] are now also warming up to Bitcoin for
[51:04] for what whatever reason. Uh and so this
[51:07] is all also described in the book that
[51:09] Bitcoin has this this sort of mind virus
[51:12] uh that really can uh get you excited
[51:14] and and get you off your butt and and
[51:16] work work hard to become successful as
[51:18] well.
[51:20] Fantastic. Okay. And in concrete terms,
[51:24] um where do you see the world economy
[51:27] going? you know, um I'm going to take
[51:29] advantage of this and try and milk this
[51:31] for as much alpha for my listeners as I
[51:34] possibly can get out of you. Um what
[51:37] what are your uh general views on the
[51:40] way things are going? Are you one of the
[51:41] people freaking out about a recession
[51:44] because of all of those tariffs or do
[51:46] you think uh it's not going to be so
[51:49] terrible they're going to back down and
[51:51] sort it out or what do you think? I I
[51:53] would point out two things. Uh number
[51:55] one is another another very
[51:58] pernitious issue that comes up with fiat
[52:01] fraud and central bank intervention and
[52:04] creation of fake money is
[52:08] that we should have had in the past 50
[52:13] years an enormous deflation of prices
[52:18] because everything is better, cheaper,
[52:22] more functional. And there's been
[52:24] enormous value created through the
[52:26] introduction of things like the the the
[52:29] the mobile computers that we call
[52:32] telephones by the invention of the
[52:34] internet by the uh Moore's law. So we
[52:40] should have had a huge
[52:43] deflationary beneficial effect for
[52:47] people and that has not happened because
[52:51] not only didn't we not have deflation,
[52:53] we had inflation. So the central banks
[52:56] and the governments have stolen from the
[53:00] people not only the purchasing power
[53:02] that existed but also the benefits of
[53:05] the deflationary technology.
[53:08] So why I'm saying that is because we
[53:11] still are living in a deflationary world
[53:15] in terms of technology because of many
[53:18] factors and artificial intelligence
[53:20] being one of them. So things should be
[53:23] less expensive. It's normal
[53:26] natural
[53:27] and we have been sold this bad idea you
[53:32] know that deflation is terrible. Nobody
[53:34] wants deflation. No, of course not.
[53:36] Especially if you owe money, you don't
[53:38] want to be in a deflationary environment
[53:39] because you got to pay more, you know,
[53:41] and who's the biggest debtor of the
[53:43] government? So, they don't want
[53:44] deflation. They want inflation to
[53:46] liquefy all the debt. So, I don't see
[53:49] that changing. On the contrary, it's
[53:54] very clear
[53:56] that the enormous amount of
[53:59] debt is causing an enormous amount of
[54:02] interest
[54:04] payments and they don't have money to
[54:06] pay it. So, guess what they're going to
[54:10] do? Print more money. Digital money.
[54:15] That's obvious. So, what's that going to
[54:17] do for the economy? Going to overheat
[54:20] it. So most probably is stocks continue
[54:25] to go up and consumption continues to go
[54:28] up until that
[54:31] day when the party the music stops and
[54:34] the party's over and somebody's left
[54:35] holding the bag which was what happened
[54:37] to Mexico in the 80 in 828 you know
[54:40] there was no more money couldn't you
[54:42] couldn't refinance and that's what we
[54:45] call a collapse and and the way out of
[54:48] it is to make people poor
[54:51] and to write off debts and that is
[54:53] called devaluation. And it was very
[54:55] interesting. I just last night I was
[54:57] watching a video by Ray Deio which I
[54:59] think is a very interesting guy and
[55:02] powerful thinker and he was explaining
[55:05] to people what a devaluation is. Imagine
[55:09] Americans do not know what a devaluation
[55:12] is. I think Europeans don't know what a
[55:15] devaluation is. I know what it is. It
[55:17] feels terrible. So I would expect more
[55:21] of that right now. I also expect that
[55:24] technology will continue.
[55:27] Absolutely. In terms of tariffs, that is
[55:29] a terrible thing. You know, why would a
[55:32] tax be a good thing? And why would this
[55:34] person in in the US dictate what some
[55:39] people can buy and what other people
[55:41] cannot buy? What right do they have to
[55:44] decide where people should buy their
[55:46] stuff? You know, it's it's ridiculous
[55:50] and and all all this
[55:52] anti-globalism
[55:53] talk is is very contaminated
[55:57] by by all these factors that we're
[56:00] saying less purchasing power, less
[56:02] mobility, more regulation. People feel
[56:05] frustrated and they say, "Well, who
[56:07] whose fault is it?" Well, it's somewhere
[56:08] in somebody else's fault, not our fault,
[56:10] somebody else's fault. So, let's close
[56:12] the border. I mean politically I know I
[56:15] understand where it comes from but
[56:17] practically it is a very bad idea
[56:20] because it's again instead of making
[56:23] things more accessible and less
[56:25] expensive things are going to become
[56:27] more expensive and less accessible. How
[56:29] can that be good and the coffers of the
[56:33] government will bulge through the tax
[56:35] collection at the borders? Very bad
[56:38] idea. So, I'm not very positive about
[56:41] the economy in general. Uh, I think that
[56:44] anybody who has an investment portfolio
[56:47] should be extremely careful because of
[56:50] the the way that stocks are valued today
[56:53] is ridiculous. I don't own a single
[56:57] stock other than gold miners, Bitcoin
[57:00] miners, and in a very small proportion.
[57:02] And that's why my portfolio is 80%
[57:05] Bitcoin and Bitcoin exposure through
[57:06] miners and 20% gold and gold exposure
[57:09] through miners and that's it. That's my
[57:11] investment portfolio. No, I don't know.
[57:13] Why do I still have gold?
[57:17] Well, I could probably move to 100%
[57:19] Bitcoin, but uh maybe I need a little
[57:22] bit more time, you know, being an old
[57:24] guy and all that.
[57:27] Well, Ricardo, your team is informing me
[57:29] that we must uh end this interview. your
[57:31] time is uh coming up. Um uh your your
[57:35] time is running out. I want to thank you
[57:36] so much for this and if you have any
[57:38] more uh final thoughts to share with us
[57:41] uh please do. Listen, I just want to say
[57:43] that your book about uh the Bitcoin
[57:46] standard was amazing. It really an eye
[57:48] openening book. I highly recommend it to
[57:50] anybody as the first step in getting
[57:53] educated. And I really like the idea of
[57:56] this evolution of money. And and when
[57:59] you understand money as a technology and
[58:03] as a technology that evolves to be more
[58:06] useful and better, then you get an
[58:09] immediate sense of why Bitcoin is so
[58:11] important. I think people would do
[58:13] really well if they studied that. So I
[58:16] know all my kids are now Bitcoin nuts.
[58:18] and uh it all started out explaining to
[58:21] them about these shells and the and the
[58:24] inflation that you can do and so forth.
[58:28] So, congratulations on that. And for me,
[58:30] it's it's been a pleasure to talk to you
[58:32] and I wish you luck. I know you're going
[58:34] off to the Bitcoin conference in Vegas
[58:37] pretty soon. So, have a big uh audience
[58:40] there and make sure to keep on spreading
[58:43] the word. It's important to educate the
[58:44] new generations.
[58:46] Thank you. Thank you so much, Ricardo.
[58:48] And yes, the Bitcoin standard. I agree
[58:50] with you. I have to agree. It's it's
[58:52] it's a good book, if I may say so
[58:53] myself. And you can get both the Bitcoin
[58:56] standard and the Bitcoin enlightenment
[58:57] from the
[58:58] safehouse.com. They're now both
[59:00] available. So go and order them
[59:02] audiobook, ebook, or hardcover book. You
[59:05] can get it from the safehouse.com and
[59:08] many other great books as well. Thank
[59:10] you so much and uh have a good day.
