[00:05] Hello, welcome to the Bitcoin Standard
[00:06] podcast. Our guest today is Alex
[00:09] Zvetszki. Alex is the author of the new
[00:12] book, The Bushidto of Bitcoin, and
[00:14] previously he'd written The Uncommunist
[00:16] Manifesto. He's also produced the
[00:19] Bitcoin Times series of magazines or
[00:22] collections of essays, I should say.
[00:24] He's also an entrepreneur who's
[00:25] currently building a unique Noster
[00:27] client called Settlantis. and he's
[00:29] previously worked on the world's first
[00:31] Bitcoin only savings app, Amber. And
[00:35] also he produced he worked on producing
[00:37] the a spirit of Satoshi Bitcoin Centric
[00:40] LLM and the last time we hosted him, we
[00:42] discussed that. But today we're going to
[00:44] be talking about the Bushidto of
[00:46] Bitcoin. Alex, welcome. Safe. It's been
[00:50] too long, man. How you doing? I am very
[00:52] good. It has been indeed. It's uh it's
[00:55] been way too long. You're uh you're too
[00:57] far in the world for us to be meeting
[00:59] too close. Am I too far or are you too
[01:01] far?
[01:03] No, I think I'm kind of in the center of
[01:05] the world. You're in the
[01:06] uh the new world. That's true. That's
[01:10] true. I do you know what? I will I will
[01:12] most likely next year be moving closer
[01:15] to you. I'll be in the center of the
[01:16] world as well. So there we go. We'll be
[01:17] nice and close. Ah, nice. So you're
[01:19] moving to Dubai? Most likely. I'm I'm
[01:21] I'm looking at it now. So Ah, nice.
[01:23] Yeah, it will be close then. Could be
[01:25] good to see you. Excellent. Excellent.
[01:27] All right. So, tell us about your new
[01:28] book, The Bashidito of Bitcoin. What is
[01:30] the Bashidito of Bitcoin? Yeah. Well,
[01:32] let's let's start with the the namesake.
[01:35] So, the word Bushida, I guess a lot of
[01:37] people always ask me what the hell does
[01:38] that mean? Um what you know, what is
[01:41] this word? It sounds Japanese and what
[01:42] the hell does it have to do with
[01:43] Bitcoin? So, if I had to sum it up, I
[01:46] would start with the the premise of that
[01:49] word. The word means way of the warrior.
[01:51] Um, and in Japan, it was the code of
[01:55] virtue that emerged from the warrior
[01:58] class who were the samurai, right? They
[02:00] they were essentially the class within
[02:04] the Japanese feudal hierarchy that
[02:08] established they protected the land, but
[02:11] they also much like the knights of
[02:13] Christendom, right? The knights of the
[02:14] west um were the ones who basically
[02:17] enforced norms, laws, etc. And um and
[02:22] what they did very similar also to the
[02:24] Christian west was they established this
[02:26] code. So in the west we kind of had
[02:28] chivalry right and it was to you know a
[02:31] way of being or a way of behaving. So
[02:33] act with courage justice loyalty love
[02:36] compassion etc. And the Japanese samurai
[02:39] came up with something similar and it
[02:41] wasn't like a prescriptive oh you know
[02:42] ten commandments this is how you must
[02:44] behave but it was a it was kind of an
[02:46] unwritten code that they they lived by.
[02:48] So the premise therefore of the bashidto
[02:51] of Bitcoin is basically a a question
[02:55] of when Bitcoin
[02:58] wins, who must we become and how must we
[03:02] behave? Because it's not so clear to me
[03:04] that everyone all of a sudden becomes
[03:06] virtuous uh once they become really
[03:08] wealthy out of Bitcoin. you know, we we
[03:10] do have these sort of talking points
[03:12] around, you know, Bitcoin fixes this and
[03:14] it lowers time preference and
[03:15] everything, but there's just as much or
[03:18] if not more evidence that people who get
[03:21] into Bitcoin, make a bunch of money, end
[03:23] up becoming degenerates and become more
[03:25] fiat uh than previously, right? And many
[03:28] many of the early Bitcoiners are
[03:30] actually probably more like that.
[03:31] there's very very few uh early
[03:33] bitcoiners that made a bunch of money
[03:35] and maintained Bitcoin only or built um
[03:38] characters of virtue. Right? So the
[03:41] whole book is basically a a discussion
[03:43] on okay when Bitcoin wins who do we
[03:45] become? Do we become a new parasitic
[03:46] elite? Do we become a bunch of Lambo
[03:48] crypto bros or do we become men and
[03:50] women of virtue? And if we want to
[03:53] become the latter, what virtues must we
[03:57] aspire towards? And that's a big part of
[03:59] the discussion is like what is that
[04:01] code? What does it look like? And and I
[04:03] make very clear, I've said this in a
[04:04] couple podcasts now, this isn't Ten
[04:06] Commandments. This is a look at the
[04:08] great cultures that preceded the great
[04:11] civilizations of Earth and what were the
[04:14] behaviors that were embedded or
[04:16] instilled into those cultures. And funny
[04:20] enough, the same virtues pop up in
[04:22] feudal Japan, in the Christian West, in
[04:26] Rome, in Greece, in ancient Persia. Uh
[04:29] like the the the great civilizations all
[04:32] had the same kind of thread. So that was
[04:34] that was sort of like what led me
[04:37] through the book. And there's there's
[04:39] six big qu uh sections of the book which
[04:41] we can sort of run through uh here and
[04:44] there, but that's basically the big
[04:46] question that it asks. And you know if I
[04:48] had to kind of sum up the sentence I
[04:49] would say it's like a a playbook for the
[04:52] leaders of tomorrow because
[04:54] fundamentally those who have the wealth
[04:57] those who have the economic means end up
[05:00] uh creating social means as well right
[05:02] they become tomorrow's leaders so how
[05:04] must we behave who must we become uh
[05:08] when we have the duty of leading the
[05:10] world. So so that's the big question
[05:11] that's what I grapple with in the book.
[05:13] Yeah. Well before we get into that I
[05:15] wanted to pick your brain on this. I
[05:16] think you you raised an interesting
[05:18] question which is um you know a lot of
[05:20] Bitcoiners make a lot of money and then
[05:22] just become degenerate shiters and spend
[05:24] the money on all kinds of high time
[05:26] preference things and um many of them
[05:29] even lose their Bitcoin. A lot of early
[05:31] Bitcoiners made a lot of money and then
[05:33] they lost it because they blew it on
[05:35] shitcoins. They gambled with it on
[05:38] trading trying to make even more
[05:39] Bitcoin. Um a lot of them invested in
[05:42] all kinds of uh stupid things and lost a
[05:44] lot of money. There's a huge number of
[05:46] Bitcoiners who I would say early on got
[05:49] lucky. They got into Bitcoin um put in,
[05:52] you know, I mean, if you got in in 2012,
[05:54] 2013, you put in a few thousand dollars,
[05:57] which for many people was um you know,
[06:01] gambling money, playing money, money
[06:03] they could have spent on a weekend in
[06:05] Vegas, but instead they said, "I'm going
[06:06] to put some money into Bitcoin." And it
[06:10] goes up very quickly in a year or two,
[06:12] and then you got yourself a fortune. So
[06:15] I'm wondering, you've probably thought
[06:17] about this question a lot because it
[06:19] motivates your book. So I'm wondering
[06:21] how do you see the breakdown in terms of
[06:23] people going down that path versus
[06:25] people realizing the kind of uh
[06:28] transformative potential that Bitcoin
[06:30] has to you in the sense that if you just
[06:33] use Bitcoin for good and you fix
[06:36] yourself so that you're not desiring
[06:38] high time preference degenerate behavior
[06:40] then you're able to save well and then
[06:42] you're able to accumulate more and more
[06:43] Bitcoin and then you can start thinking
[06:45] about long-term goals and start thinking
[06:46] about doing meaningful things with your
[06:48] life. So, I guess the provocative
[06:50] question I have here, and I think this
[06:53] might piss off a lot of Bitcoiners, but
[06:54] you know, that's what I'm here for, uh,
[06:57] is, is this really, um, you know, we
[07:00] like to talk a lot about Bitcoin fixes
[07:02] this, Bitcoin fixes this, but is this
[07:04] really the culture of Bitcoiners who've
[07:06] made it, or is it just the culture of
[07:07] the Bitcoiners who are uh,
[07:12] living optimizing to make it by reducing
[07:16] their expenditure enormously, increasing
[07:18] their income, working hard, you know,
[07:20] stay humble stacks ass. Is that really
[07:22] going to be the culture of the are these
[07:25] Bitcoiners going to be the same when
[07:26] their Bitcoin portfolio does another
[07:29] 100x or is that just the thing that they
[07:32] do now while they're, you know, having
[07:33] to eat crow at work from their boss and
[07:36] having to keep putting up with all that
[07:38] stuff? So, they put on this uh this
[07:41] stoic face, accept it, and you know,
[07:45] yeah. Is it is it all I'm not in it for
[07:47] the Lambos. I'm in it for the uh
[07:49] revolution and I'm in it for the
[07:51] transformation. And so, you know, you
[07:53] suck it up for 5 10 years and you keep
[07:55] stacking your SATs. But then once your
[07:56] SATs uh really pile up, um then you get
[08:00] your Lambo. Then you get your Lambos and
[08:02] then
[08:03] uh then maybe maybe you start
[08:05] shitcoining, you know, maybe you you go
[08:08] and you introduce the new uh I don't
[08:10] know, Ethereum or whatever and you start
[08:13] telling people how it changes the world.
[08:15] We've seen some of these maxis switch
[08:18] later on. I think in some cases, which
[08:20] I'm not going to name it. Sometimes it
[08:22] seems that it's so obvious that it seems
[08:25] like it's just OBSC. People are trying
[08:27] to disappear from the Bitcoin world. I
[08:29] think you and I know a couple or at
[08:31] least one for sure that comes to mind,
[08:33] but we're not going to name him now.
[08:35] Yep. But uh maybe maybe it's real. Maybe
[08:38] you just have a lot of money and then
[08:40] you start thinking that uh you are
[08:42] better than everybody and then you can't
[08:44] do no wrong and since you picked this
[08:47] genius idea that made you very rich then
[08:49] clearly all your other genius ideas are
[08:51] going to be very rich. So what do you
[08:53] think having thought about this question
[08:54] more? It's a it's a tough question. Do
[08:56] you know what it reminds me of the
[08:58] question about nature versus nurture?
[09:00] Right. Uhhuh. Um and which one is it?
[09:03] Right. like when you know you're you're
[09:05] a father obviously and you are raising
[09:08] your kids what is more important in your
[09:10] in your opinion is it nature or is it
[09:12] nurture in fact let's let's do this as a
[09:14] discussion what what do you think it is
[09:15] like when you're raising kids what what
[09:17] matters more well I mean matters more is
[09:20] a difficult question to answer because
[09:22] you can't really um you can't really
[09:24] specify what do we mean by more I think
[09:27] both are enormously important I think
[09:30] you can find examples where nature
[09:32] overcomes nurture So people who are, you
[09:36] could say, good genetic stock, who have
[09:38] good intelligence, good um values
[09:42] embedded in them, even though they grow
[09:43] up in some of the most uh horrific
[09:45] environments that would destroy 99.9% of
[09:48] the people that grow up there. But
[09:50] sometimes you get these diamonds in a
[09:52] rough just for whom nurture doesn't
[09:54] matter at all. And uh you know, they're
[09:58] just shine through. Yeah. Yeah. they
[10:00] their intelligence, their ability to
[10:03] delay gratification shines through and
[10:05] they find a way out of their
[10:07] predicament. Um but on the other hand,
[10:10] there are some times when you see that
[10:12] nature, sorry, nurture matters a lot. I
[10:15] mean, I think the way that I would see
[10:17] it perhaps I think the um the example of
[10:20] sports is a good u is is a good way of
[10:22] looking at it. Yes. So a lot of a lot of
[10:25] people Yeah. A lot of people have this
[10:27] idea that
[10:28] u you know if you just work hard you too
[10:31] can be Michael Jordan and it's not true.
[10:35] There's no set of exercises that I could
[10:39] have done from the day that I was born
[10:41] that would have made me Michael Jordan.
[10:42] There's no way I would have become a
[10:44] professional basketball player. And
[10:46] that's not just the height. It's um
[10:48] athletic ability. And you know, athletic
[10:51] coaches can go see go watch a bunch of
[10:55] seven-year-olds play a soccer game or a
[10:57] basketball game and they can tell
[11:00] definitely for sure who is never going
[11:02] to make it as an athlete. You look at
[11:04] them, you know, this guy definitely not
[11:06] going to be a pro, definitely not going
[11:07] to be lifting trophies for a living. And
[11:10] then there are some kids that have the
[11:12] potential to do it, but there's no such
[11:14] a thing as a kid who's destined to do
[11:16] it, to make it, right? So even no matter
[11:19] how talented you are, no matter how
[11:21] skilled you are, you're not going to be
[11:23] Michael Jordan unless you really,
[11:24] really, really work hard at it.
[11:26] Especially this at this point, if you
[11:28] look at uh professional athletes, there
[11:30] was a time, you know, in the 1970s and '
[11:32] 80s, there were professional athletes
[11:35] who would drink a lot, who would party a
[11:37] lot, who wouldn't train, and there's
[11:39] many stories about people like that, and
[11:41] they'd make it to the top. You know,
[11:42] George Best is a famous one in
[11:44] Manchester United and he was one of the
[11:46] best players in the world and he was an
[11:49] alcoholic and up until, you know, at 26
[11:52] he retired because he just completely
[11:54] ruined himself. But before he retired,
[11:57] he or at least up until a couple of
[11:59] years before that, he he was still doing
[12:02] really well even though he didn't take
[12:03] his training seriously and he was
[12:04] drinking heavily. Well, that's gone now.
[12:08] At that point, you know, football was a
[12:10] much smaller sport. there wasn't that
[12:12] much u there wasn't that much
[12:15] professionalism in it and so if you were
[12:17] really talented like best you could make
[12:20] it even if you're drinking and you could
[12:22] outplay really hardworking players who
[12:25] didn't have the same kind of ability
[12:27] today this doesn't work anymore there
[12:29] are no players in the professional game
[12:32] that you and I have ever heard of that
[12:34] are not extremely dedicated all the ones
[12:36] that are are drinking and partying all
[12:39] the ones that are not taking their job
[12:40] easily
[12:41] they never made it past 20 in the
[12:44] professional game. And there's all these
[12:46] stories of really talented players. So,
[12:48] for instance, there's a another
[12:49] Manchester United player called Rall
[12:51] Morrison. Alex Ferguson, who managed
[12:54] Manchester United for 26 years, worked
[12:56] with some of the best players in the
[12:57] world. He said Rall Morrison is the best
[12:59] player he's ever coached. Rell Morrison
[13:01] didn't make it as a professional. Uh he
[13:04] messed up and he went had a bunch of
[13:06] stints at a bunch of big clubs, failed
[13:09] everywhere. and I think he's probably
[13:11] retired at this point. So, so what I
[13:14] would say the answer to that question
[13:15] would be nature
[13:19] is hugely important and it determines
[13:22] the u the the range of outcomes. So,
[13:26] it's very clear that I was never going
[13:28] to make it in professional sports. I may
[13:32] have uh you know I could make it as a
[13:35] doctor maybe I could make it as an
[13:36] engineer but it doesn't mean I will make
[13:38] it into those things. It means that if I
[13:41] work really hard if I have the right
[13:42] nurture the right values if I'm able to
[13:45] develop uh properly and if I'm able to
[13:47] focus on those things then I can make it
[13:49] in that field. So I don't think you can
[13:52] discount one or the other and it's
[13:53] difficult to prioritize them in terms of
[13:56] more but both are uh extremely important
[14:00] although I guess you know there there I
[14:04] I would say there are examples where you
[14:05] can overcome nurture but it's very
[14:08] difficult to overcome nature there's
[14:10] never you can't train enough to become
[14:12] Michael Jordan no matter what happens.
[14:14] Yep. Yep. Yep. So precisely what you
[14:17] just described then is the answer to my
[14:19] other question is does Bitcoin fix
[14:21] people or does it attract people who
[14:24] have the right ingredients? It's the
[14:26] it's the same kind of thing. I don't
[14:28] know which one it is and I don't think
[14:29] there is a conclusive answer. I think
[14:31] that it is fundamentally a mixture of
[14:34] both. I think you need to have the
[14:37] predisposition inside you. Your nature
[14:40] has to be that kind which is I want to
[14:43] do better. I want to excel. I want to do
[14:46] good things. I want to be a virtuous
[14:47] person. I, you know, I want to uh move
[14:51] forward in life. I have a vision. I have
[14:53] some something like that. Right? So that
[14:55] has to exist. And then if you find
[14:58] Bitcoin, it gives you a framework within
[15:01] which that kind of behavior, that kind
[15:04] of nature, that kind of desire will
[15:07] succeed, right? Because if you are
[15:09] someone, so so let's say you have that
[15:10] kind of predisposition, that kind of
[15:12] nature, and you're like, "Okay, look, I
[15:13] want to save." So you start saving and
[15:14] putting your money in the bank, you're
[15:16] going to get robbed, right? Because
[15:18] you're going to lose it on inflation,
[15:20] blah blah blah blah blah blah, right?
[15:21] So, so I think the answer to your
[15:25] previous question is very much similar
[15:28] to the answer for nature versus nurture.
[15:31] It's neither one. It's a it's a it
[15:35] requires both. And also the the analogy
[15:38] that you used for the um for the sports
[15:40] people was interesting as well because
[15:41] it made me think you said the the bar
[15:43] used to be lower for sports people um in
[15:46] a in a nurture capacity and now it's
[15:48] much higher and maybe now it's like we
[15:52] lived in a world previously if you think
[15:55] you know back 70 80 100 years where
[15:59] society had these virtues still embedded
[16:02] within it. Now society has kind of
[16:04] skewed itself into this degenerate like
[16:07] everything around us is degenerate.
[16:08] Everything around us is gambling. So now
[16:10] the bar is much higher in order for you
[16:13] maybe the bar is not higher because that
[16:15] that analogy doesn't make sense. It's
[16:17] it's much you know to be a virtuous
[16:19] person is not very uh like to
[16:21] differentiate from the madness is not
[16:23] very hard but maybe the the ability to
[16:26] separate yourself out of the really
[16:29] costic environment of poor nurture is a
[16:31] lot harder now than it used to be right
[16:34] so there's there's some sort of
[16:35] similarity there but anyway that's
[16:36] that's my answer to your question is I
[16:40] think it's a mixture of both I don't
[16:42] think Bitcoin can fix someone who is
[16:45] fundamentally a crook crooked person
[16:47] inside. And I think there are many of
[16:49] those fundamentally crooked people in
[16:50] the world. Um, you know, there's I don't
[16:53] think any amount of Austrian economics
[16:55] or Bitcoin or anything is going to fix
[16:57] them. They're fundamentally when they
[16:59] get wealthy, they're going to be they're
[17:00] going to do they the wealth is going to
[17:03] amplify the worst parts of them um in
[17:06] the same way as technology might amplify
[17:08] the worst parts of them, etc. So, so
[17:10] that's my that's my working theory at
[17:13] this point. The Bitcoin Standard podcast
[17:15] is brought to you by the safehouse.com,
[17:17] my independent publisher and bookshop,
[17:18] selling the best Bitcoin books in
[17:20] high-quality cloth hard covers built to
[17:22] last for generations. Most books these
[17:24] days are pretty fiat. They're flimsy and
[17:25] they fall apart quickly. And I did not
[17:27] want that for my books. So, I set up the

[18:16] brought to you by the daylight computer.
[18:18] I love to work early in the morning and
[18:20] late at night or in the sun outdoors,
[18:22] but regular computer screens are
[18:23] terrible at these times and they strain
[18:25] your eyes. For years, I've wanted a
[18:28] paper-like electronic screen on a simple
[18:30] computer I could use to write. I tried
[18:32] several models, but none were very good.
[18:35] Now, finally, Daylight have delivered a
[18:38] fantastic full function tablet with a
[18:40] paper-like screen that's easy on your
[18:42] eyes and great for outdoor use. I've
[18:45] been using the Daylight computer to
[18:46] write my next book, and it is absolutely
[18:49] fantastic, and it has led me to invest
[18:51] in this company myself. Check out my
[18:53] interview with Anjan Kata in episode
[18:56] 249. Yeah, I will say though, I think
[18:59] the quality of the average Bitcoiner is
[19:02] going to improve over time. Um, so the
[19:05] there's a sense that as we um expand, as
[19:09] the Bitcoin network grows and more and
[19:11] more normies join, we're going to be
[19:13] getting more of the um, you know, lower
[19:18] intelligence integrity. Maybe we we'd
[19:21] like to think that it's the smartest
[19:23] people who get Bitcoin early. And
[19:25] probably there is some of that. I mean,
[19:26] it takes an enormous amount of um brain
[19:29] power to be able to get Bitcoin early
[19:31] when there are very little resources
[19:33] explaining it. There is some of that,
[19:36] but I think early on if you it was
[19:40] highly likely if you got into Bitcoin,
[19:44] it was highly likely that you'd make a
[19:46] quick buck from it because Bitcoin
[19:48] initially used to spike very fast and it
[19:52] would go up really quickly. So, for
[19:53] instance, if you bought in 2012,
[19:56] um it was at the end of 2012 was
[19:58] something like $10, $12 at the having in
[20:00] 2012. 50% move is very different at 100
[20:03] bucks than it is at 100,000. Yeah. Yeah.
[20:05] So it went from 10 bucks to a,000 bucks
[20:07] by November 2013. So it did 100x in a
[20:10] year between 2012 and
[20:13] 2013. And it had done the previous 100x
[20:16] in in a similar sort of time frame. So
[20:18] it was quite possible for somebody who's
[20:20] just a DGEN gambler to get in, wait for
[20:23] 6 months, 1 year, make life-changing
[20:25] money, and get out. But now I think it's
[20:28] a lot harder. you you need to huddle for
[20:31] uh significantly longer periods of time.
[20:35] So, think about uh you know the 100x
[20:38] when was the last time we were at a
[20:39] thousand to go from a,000 to 100,000.
[20:42] So, from 10 to 1,000 took a year. From
[20:46] 1,000 to
[20:47] 100,000 took about 11 years. Yeah. Yeah.
[20:51] From 2013 to 2014. So, uh sorry, from
[20:56] 2013 to 2024. So, 11 years. Yeah. So at
[21:00] the so to to make that sort of money,
[21:03] you need to have a low time preference.
[21:05] To make big money in Bitcoin now, you
[21:07] need to suck it up and stay humble and
[21:09] stack ads
[21:11] and cut down on the lambos, cut down on
[21:14] the conspicuous consumption and stack as
[21:16] hard as you can so that you can make the
[21:17] money. And you can't really do it
[21:20] overnight. It's uh it's harder. So I
[21:23] think the selection mechanism is
[21:25] probably becoming a little bit more
[21:27] favorable to having a lower time
[21:29] preference probably. Yeah. I mean the
[21:33] where I think
[21:35] the the avenue to get the Bitcoin just
[21:38] changes, right? So previously would have
[21:39] been getting it from a faucet or just
[21:41] buying it online or whatever the case
[21:42] is. Now it's like okay maybe I can ape
[21:45] into this shitcoin and then as a result
[21:48] sell out into Bitcoin so that I can go
[21:49] from zero to 100 Bitcoin, right? So, so
[21:51] maybe the mechanism changes, but I think
[21:55] fundamentally what you're describing
[21:57] there is the fact that most people in
[22:00] the world I think have the right
[22:03] ingredients. You know, I'm people know
[22:05] me for being very critical. You know, I
[22:06] wrote the remnant essay, talked about
[22:08] how the masses don't matter and you
[22:09] know, most people are lemings and stupid
[22:10] and all this sort of stuff. But even
[22:12] though I say all that sort of stuff, I
[22:15] recognize, you know, very very clearly
[22:17] that most people, you give them a good
[22:20] enough framework, like you provide a
[22:22] framework for excellence, most people
[22:24] will find their way to creating
[22:28] something, building something, producing
[22:29] something, having a family, you know,
[22:31] and and like doing that, right? If you
[22:33] give them a framework for degeneracy,
[22:35] it's very easy for them to get swayed in
[22:37] there. And and this is, you know, the
[22:38] the the essence of my prior sort of talk
[22:41] about like the the masses don't matter.
[22:44] It's not that I'm hating on the masses
[22:46] or I think they're evil or anything like
[22:47] that. They're just easily swayed. You
[22:49] give them whatever framework and they
[22:50] will adapt to the framework. Right?
[22:52] There is a small uh virtuous elite for
[22:56] example who can despite the framework,
[22:59] despite the nurture you give them, they
[23:00] have the nature to break through that.
[23:02] So if you put a a a poor framework
[23:06] around them which is the fiat framework
[23:07] we're living in a couple of us will
[23:10] reject that framework and we'll live in
[23:12] accordance to what we find as our you
[23:14] know as our own virtue virtuous compass
[23:16] moral compass that the standard normie
[23:18] will not but if we can usher in a new
[23:22] framework and this is why in the book I
[23:23] kind of call bitcoin a framework for
[23:26] excellence that's that's in in my mind
[23:28] like you want to build a strong culture
[23:30] a strong family a strong civilization
[23:32] whatever It needs to be the north star
[23:34] needs to be excellence. The north star
[23:35] cannot be equality. Cannot be the
[23:38] average man. Cannot be um uh like uh
[23:43] every man for himself or you know uh
[23:46] redistribution of wealth or any of that
[23:47] sort of stuff. It must be excellence.
[23:49] That's the north star. That doesn't mean
[23:51] everybody can be excellent but it
[23:53] provides a framework in which those who
[23:56] can excel will excel and even those who
[23:58] cannot can find their way up the
[24:01] mountain. You know the the etmology of
[24:03] the word excellence means to climb a
[24:05] mountain. So coming back to your earlier
[24:08] point yes as Bitcoin matures um the you
[24:11] know the capacity to degen uh will
[24:14] change at least directly for Bitcoin. I
[24:16] think people will find other ways to be
[24:18] degenerates. But um ultimately I think
[24:20] most people have the good ingredients.
[24:22] Most people with the right nurture have
[24:26] enough of a nature to be you know
[24:30] virtuous people and that's what we want
[24:31] to create. We want to create more of
[24:33] that and beyond just Bitcoin. We need uh
[24:37] in in my opinion, this is the thesis of
[24:38] the book is we need a playbook or we
[24:41] need a code that people can uh align
[24:45] around and I mean more than
[24:49] just I'm I'm going to go off on a little
[24:51] bit of a tangent which is related to the
[24:52] book here but there's towards the end of
[24:55] the book I talk about why I chose the
[24:57] word code of virtue because when I first
[24:58] started writing the book I called it a
[25:00] moral code and I got rid of the word
[25:01] morality from the whole book. went and
[25:03] control F and deleted all that because I
[25:05] think if you want morality, you should
[25:07] go, you know, read the Bible or
[25:08] something like that or read the Quran or
[25:10] whatever your belief uh system is.
[25:13] Virtue is different to morality. And in
[25:15] fact, I believe virtue is upstream of
[25:17] morality. Jimmy Jimmy Song and I had a a
[25:19] debate about this. And for me, a virtue
[25:21] is an act. It's almost like a a
[25:24] combination of principle and behavior.
[25:27] If you could kind of like unite those
[25:28] two concepts of a principle in behavior,
[25:30] like conceptually think about a virtue
[25:31] as those two things, a virtue is
[25:34] something you can't lie about. Like I
[25:35] can sit here and moralize to you and
[25:37] say, you know, if you don't believe in
[25:38] Jesus or this or that or Muhammad, um
[25:40] you're evil, right? But I I can't tell
[25:44] you, for example, you should be a vegan
[25:47] if I'm a big fat slob, right? Or if I'm
[25:49] weak or something like that. Like a
[25:50] virtue is almost like an action. So you
[25:52] can tell people who have the uh the
[25:55] virtue for example of uh discipline or
[25:58] the virtue of uh responsibility
[26:00] excellence around their physical body.
[26:02] You can't lie about that. And for me a
[26:05] virtue like things like courage,
[26:07] right? Doesn't matter if you're Chinese,
[26:11] Hindu, Muslim, Christian, atheist,
[26:14] whatever, doesn't matter. We all
[26:17] recognize courage. So a virtue is
[26:18] something that transcends beliefs. So
[26:20] for me when I wrote the book I was
[26:22] thinking in this kind of thing. It's
[26:23] like how do we establish a code that
[26:27] isn't about religion belief all this
[26:29] sort of stuff. You can do what you want
[26:30] but you and I can be of different creeds
[26:32] different beliefs but we can align
[26:34] around okay this virtue is good. To be
[26:36] responsible leads us in the right
[26:38] direction. To be courageous leads us in
[26:40] the right direction. to be uh uh
[26:43] dutiful, to be loyal, to be uh like
[26:47] self-controlled, self-restraint. That's
[26:49] the 10th virtue. To be compassionate.
[26:51] This constellation of virtues will lead
[26:54] us in the right direction. That's kind
[26:56] of the
[26:57] um the premise there. I know I went on a
[26:59] tangent. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. No, that's
[27:01] good. But um I just wanted to say you
[27:03] were mentioning earlier that
[27:05] um the example of well if the masses
[27:09] would just go along with whatever
[27:10] framework and I think this is this is
[27:12] very true and very astute because and
[27:14] and it doesn't necessarily have to carry
[27:15] this kind of elitist condescending
[27:18] connotation to it because I think
[27:21] compare it to the example to the
[27:23] question of obesity. So among the
[27:26] dumbest ideas in modern nutrition
[27:28] science and modern medical science,
[27:30] there are a lot of very dumb ideas. One
[27:32] of the very dumb ones is that people are
[27:34] fat because of genetics. And it's so
[27:37] dumb because you look at pictures of the
[27:41] same city 100 years ago, these same
[27:43] people's grandparents 100 years ago,
[27:46] there wasn't a single fat person in a
[27:48] picture. So you look at pictures of New
[27:49] York in
[27:50] 1925. There would have been maybe one
[27:53] out of a thousand who's fat. I mean that
[27:55] there was a photo somebody showed of
[27:58] somebody who would who was a circus act
[28:00] the a fat guy who go to the circus and
[28:03] people would look at him because he was
[28:04] so fat. And he's you know if you saw him
[28:08] in America today he wouldn't think of
[28:09] himself as fat. he'd call himself big
[28:11] boned and tell you that it's not about
[28:13] his food, that it's about uh something
[28:16] glandular or hormonal or genetic or
[28:18] something like that. He's kind, you
[28:20] know, above average, not average in
[28:23] America, but fairly common. There's
[28:25] probably 20 30% of the American
[28:28] population that is
[28:29] more obese than he is. So, this used to
[28:34] be the extreme outlier. This used to be
[28:36] the circus act. This used to be um from
[28:40] the genetic profile. This was the fat
[28:43] genes at their extreme allowed for one
[28:46] out of maybe a thousand people to be
[28:48] this uh obese. Well, today it allows for
[28:51] 30% of the population to be or 20%
[28:54] maybe. So clearly, you know, we haven't
[28:57] had a world in which we've uh
[28:59] eugenically or disgenically if you
[29:01] want bred the fat people excessively
[29:04] over the last 100 years and uh neutered
[29:07] all the fit people in order to arrive at
[29:08] a world in which the genes have switched
[29:10] so much. We we haven't had fat breeding
[29:13] programs to make sure that the genetics
[29:15] have changed so much. That's the only
[29:17] way you could explain that and we
[29:18] haven't had that. So on the contrary,
[29:20] you would expect that it would be the
[29:21] other way around. um obese people are
[29:23] less likely to live long and less likely
[29:25] to um uh have a lot of children, less
[29:28] likely to attract uh mates perhaps. So
[29:32] if anything, the fat genes should be
[29:34] getting weeded out or getting less
[29:36] common in society. And yet we've seen
[29:39] obesity go from maybe 1% to 30, 40, 50,
[29:43] 60%, depends on how you define it, but
[29:45] it's gone up so much. And the answer of
[29:47] course is not genetic. The answer is the
[29:48] food environment. The answer is because
[29:51] 100 years ago, people ate a lot more
[29:54] normal natural food, a lot less heavily
[29:57] processed food. They ate a lot less of
[29:59] the um particularly I think the most
[30:02] important ones is the grains and the
[30:05] processed grains, flour, things like
[30:07] that. So, we've switched the food
[30:09] environment from being predominantly
[30:11] meat-based, which was the case at the
[30:13] early 20th century. either you ate meat
[30:15] if you had money and if you were really
[30:17] poor you ate basically uh plants that
[30:20] were relatively
[30:22] fresh not a lot of heavily processed
[30:24] food so with that you see the the
[30:27] population shifts to becoming a lot more
[30:29] obese today because of this food and u
[30:33] the idea that it is genetic I don't
[30:35] think it makes any sense um and I think
[30:38] the same thing applies when you look at
[30:40] issues of virtue
[30:42] um if you I think and I would tend to
[30:45] agree that today there's a lot less
[30:46] virtue in the world than probably in the
[30:48] past. I don't think this is just
[30:50] sentimentalism and I don't think it's
[30:52] just because I'm getting older. I think
[30:54] um by many objective measures you look
[30:58] around you see a lot of places where um
[31:00] you know you hear stories where 100
[31:02] years ago it was common for people to
[31:04] leave their doors open and now things
[31:06] are becoming very different. There's a
[31:08] lot more crime, a lot less social
[31:09] cohesion. So these things are happening
[31:13] but I don't think it's um you know it's
[31:16] it's uh it can be explained with
[31:19] genetics or anything like that. I think
[31:20] it's the same population. So put them
[31:23] under a gold standard 150 years ago you
[31:26] were less likely to witness these kind
[31:28] of things. You had more social cohesion.
[31:30] You had people who
[31:32] [Music]
[31:33] um for whom virtue mattered. And with
[31:37] time as you switch to a world in
[31:39] which as I like to explain it you know
[31:42] in my um in in the Bitcoin stand and the
[31:44] fiat stand I focus on the aspect of
[31:45] money and time preference as the money
[31:47] declines people's ability to provide for
[31:49] the future declines and so the future
[31:51] becomes less certain. So people start
[31:53] discounting the future more and caring
[31:55] less about the future and all that leads
[31:57] to them becoming more uh present
[32:00] oriented which means behaving in a way
[32:03] that satisfies present immediate needs
[32:06] and provides gratification in the
[32:08] present at the expense of the future.

[33:35] bitcoinway.com and start bitcoining more
[33:38] confidently. Correct. I mean, this is
[33:41] this is undeniable. And I think this is
[33:42] the big aha moment that a lot of
[33:44] Bitcoiners have, which is what I mean,
[33:45] that's the genesis of the uh argument
[33:48] Bitcoin fixes this, right? Like, if you
[33:49] had to boil down the entire argument of
[33:51] why Bitcoin fixes anything, it's to do
[33:53] with time preference. And you you wrote
[33:55] about that specifically in um in the
[33:57] Bitcoin times edition 5 that we that we
[33:59] did. And you know, you've wrote about it
[34:01] 10 times in your books. I I take that as
[34:04] a given in the book. I say, "Okay, look,
[34:05] that is definitely important." What I
[34:08] then talk about is how do we uh choose
[34:11] to behave? So like a couple of the
[34:12] things in there I talk about you know
[34:14] the difference uh between you know what
[34:16] what is the opposite of excellence for
[34:18] example well it's not bad it's
[34:20] mediocrity and average right so in a
[34:23] society that uh holds up mediocrity as
[34:26] as the thing that you should aspire
[34:27] towards you know don't be surprised that
[34:29] you move away from excellence and you no
[34:32] longer climb the mountain right I talk
[34:33] about how uh you don't want equality
[34:37] what you actually want is fairness and
[34:40] they're actually very different
[34:41] concepts, right? Like uh equality is
[34:44] unfair often. Like if you if we use the
[34:46] football analogy that you were talking
[34:47] about before, like if we just wanted
[34:49] every game to have a nice equal outcome,
[34:51] you know, like you have to take away the
[34:54] goals from the better team and you have
[34:55] to give the goals to the worst team,
[34:56] right? Like it doesn't make any sense.
[34:58] But people sitting out there, you know,
[34:59] talking about equality, equality,
[35:00] equality. You know, I've got another
[35:02] point here about, you know, we all know
[35:05] and I think it's doesn't take a lot of
[35:07] IQ to realize that equality of outcome,
[35:09] for example, is extremely evil. But in
[35:12] the book, I also talk about how equality
[35:14] of opportunity is also quite ridiculous.
[35:17] Like you you can't have equality of
[35:20] opportunity unless you could somehow,
[35:23] you know, predistribute all of the
[35:25] resources in the world equally
[35:27] everywhere somehow. If you gave
[35:29] everybody the same genetics, if you gave
[35:31] everybody the same parents, the same
[35:32] upbringing, like basically you'd have to
[35:34] nuke the world. The big one looks
[35:36] exactly all of it. Like so so equality
[35:38] of opportunity is also a stupidity. Like
[35:40] so, you know, I I try and touch on all
[35:42] of these things that are necessary
[35:44] around like and I and I frame Bitcoin as
[35:47] the keystone. Like if you want to build
[35:49] a bridge, you need the keystone. And
[35:52] without the keystone, the bridge
[35:53] collapses. But the keystone itself is
[35:56] not enough without the rest of the
[35:58] stones uh around it. And to me the rest
[36:01] of the stones uh are what are these
[36:04] virtues, right? You you need to
[36:06] cultivate responsibility in young men
[36:10] particularly. Um, you need to cultivate
[36:12] excellence. You need to cultivate duty.
[36:14] You need to cultivate self-restraint.
[36:15] You need to cultivate compassion as
[36:16] well. You need to c like there's a
[36:18] there's a section in there which
[36:19] discusses how justice is fundamentally a
[36:24] virtue and it's extremely important. But
[36:26] justice untempered by compassion can
[36:30] become extremely rigid. Right? So, so
[36:33] you need this sort of constellation of
[36:35] uh virtues which have a tension among
[36:37] them.
[36:39] Um, there's a there's another point in
[36:42] here. Okay, an interesting one. This
[36:44] will piss off a bunch of Bitcoiners. I
[36:45] talk about how freedom is not a virtue.
[36:49] Freedom is a value. It's it's something
[36:51] that you want to experience, but it
[36:54] comes specifically from the virtue of
[36:57] responsibility. So, if I want to take
[37:00] away your freedoms, I don't do it
[37:02] overtly. This is what the communists and
[37:04] all the idiots they they did wrong and
[37:06] they figured it out later how to do it
[37:07] better. Is if I overtly take away your
[37:10] freedom, you're going to push back
[37:12] because it you you impact the feeling
[37:14] directly. But if I slowly slowly by
[37:16] slowly erode your
[37:19] responsibility, you give away your
[37:22] freedom, right? You become more of a
[37:24] dependent instead of more of an
[37:26] autonomous agent. So I don't know if you
[37:28] want to pull on any of those threads,
[37:30] but this is essentially like your point
[37:33] about lowering the time preference that
[37:35] establishes an environment. You know, if
[37:37] we look at the gold standard as proof
[37:38] and if we think forward, if we project
[37:40] forward a 100 years, you know, the the
[37:43] environment on a Bitcoin standard should
[37:46] nurture the masses and even the elites
[37:49] uh into a um into a way of being that is
[37:54] more virtuous, granted, but what should
[37:58] those virtues be and how do we start
[37:59] cultivating them today? Um which is like
[38:02] this is where the two ideas come
[38:03] together. Yeah. Yeah, I want to I want
[38:06] to I want to get into the virtues in a
[38:08] minute, but I wanted to comment on the
[38:10] whole freedom thing. I think I uh I I
[38:12] agree with you and I think I've um I've
[38:16] as I've matured more, I've become even
[38:19] though I still consider myself a
[38:20] libertarian, but I don't think
[38:22] libertarianism means freedom. And I
[38:24] think this is a very immature way of uh
[38:27] thinking of it. I think that what you're
[38:29] talking about is liberality,
[38:31] libertinism. If your if your idea is
[38:34] freedom, it's the idea that I get to do
[38:36] what I want. And that's not what
[38:38] libertarianism is. And the more that you
[38:41] think about libertarianism critically,
[38:42] the more you try and uh iron out the
[38:45] inconsistencies in your worldview, the
[38:48] more I believe you arrive at a
[38:49] Rothbardian and Hoppian understanding of
[38:52] what libertarianism is. And for that, I
[38:54] think there's a great book called
[38:55] Getting Libertarianism Right uh by
[38:57] Hopper. And uh generally all of Papa's
[39:02] work is pretty great on this. But I
[39:03] think a key point here is that this
[39:06] notion that you want to be free is kind
[39:08] of meaningless. Things actually have
[39:10] consequences. And you can't just declare
[39:14] that you want to be free from
[39:16] consequences. Um so if you want to uh
[39:21] you want you for instance, you want the
[39:23] freedom to smoke weed, great. So this
[39:26] this one was, you know, 10 years ago, 15
[39:28] years ago, this was one of the main
[39:30] selling points for libertarians. A lot
[39:32] of people became libertarians because
[39:33] they wanted to smoke weed because this
[39:35] truly is a travesty that people were
[39:37] having their lives ruined because they
[39:39] smoked a joint. The joint is relatively
[39:40] harmless. And but getting caught with a
[39:43] joint is not harmless. It can destroy
[39:44] your life. And it truly is a travesty.
[39:47] And I still think that, you know, the
[39:48] war on drugs in the way that it is
[39:49] fought was
[39:51] extremely criminal, unjustified. But
[39:55] this notion that um your worldview
[39:58] revolves around people need to be free
[40:01] to smoke weed is very immature because
[40:04] that on its own doesn't really mean
[40:07] anything. Um it's not about the freedom
[40:10] of doing particular acts. The correct
[40:13] framework for understanding this is the
[40:15] freedom to own property and it's about
[40:18] property rights. And if the issue is
[40:22] about property rights, then you can
[40:24] clearly see why just like you want to
[40:27] smoke weed, somebody might want to not
[40:30] live in an area where there are people
[40:32] who smoke weed and there will be other
[40:34] people who want to live in that area.
[40:36] So, and you know, if you go to an
[40:38] American city where they've legalized it
[40:40] now, they're all liberal, lefty,
[40:43] psychotic. Yeah. Yeah. And I think, you
[40:46] know, it's it's a huge u it's a huge
[40:48] wakeup call for a lot of us who thought,
[40:50] "Wow, you know, this should be
[40:51] legalized." And um it's it's a harmless
[40:54] plant, but you go to a park and you want
[40:57] your kids to play on the swings and
[40:58] slides and there's a smell of weed
[41:01] everywhere and there's people doing
[41:02] fentinil and the drugs and needles
[41:05] everywhere and you have to look around
[41:06] on the floor because you don't want your
[41:08] kids to step on some heroin needle or
[41:10] something like that. M so um this kind
[41:14] of um degeneration of uh the the public
[41:18] space that has happened because of weed
[41:21] has made me far more sympathetic to the
[41:23] idea that people want to stay away from
[41:25] weed or people may want to stay away
[41:26] from alcohol or they want to live in
[41:28] places where there these things don't
[41:29] exist. And so this notion that you as a
[41:32] libertarian support the right of people
[41:33] to smoke weed is for me meaningless.
[41:36] Because if you want the right to smoke
[41:37] weed, what about my right to live in a
[41:40] place where there are no weed smokers?
[41:41] And I'm not saying we need to have a war
[41:43] on drugs like the US did. I'm not saying
[41:46] people should be thrown in jail for 20
[41:47] years for smoking a joint. I'm saying
[41:49] that the correct libertarian framework
[41:52] is not pro-w weed or anti-weed. It's pro
[41:56] property rights. It's pro people having
[41:58] the right to enter into living
[42:00] arrangements which allow them to live in
[42:04] the kind of society that they want. So
[42:06] if you want to smoke weed then go live
[42:08] in a place where people smoke weed and
[42:09] if I don't want to smoke weed then I can
[42:11] live with people who don't want it. And
[42:14] so you find communities emerge where
[42:17] people have rules and you can see this
[42:20] developing where you know this city uh
[42:23] if you want to live in this city there's
[42:25] a contract you need to sign and the
[42:26] contract stipulates that you can't smoke
[42:29] weed and you don't need and and you know
[42:30] once it's contractual once it's
[42:32] voluntarily agreed to then you don't
[42:34] need a police state. You can just tell
[42:36] people if you want to live in the city
[42:38] you need to do a drug test once a month.
[42:40] That's it. And so then or you know
[42:44] random drug tests or whatever you
[42:45] arrange a sort of framework where you
[42:47] don't need to be going around and having
[42:49] police shooting at uh uh 17 year olds in
[42:53] order to stop them from selling weed to
[42:55] each other. You just test people and
[42:57] then there are clear contractual rules
[43:00] that say what happens if you fail the
[43:01] drug test. Well, if you fail the drug
[43:03] test then you don't belong in this
[43:05] neighborhood. then you have to sell your
[43:07] house or you have to pay a fine or uh
[43:10] some sort of arrangement is done. Now
[43:11] you might think well why would anybody
[43:13] want to get into something like this?
[43:15] Why would you want to put yourself in
[43:17] that uh position? And I think the answer
[43:20] is go to San Francisco, go to Toronto
[43:23] and see why you might want to do that.
[43:25] The answer is uh people who willingly
[43:28] would willingly accept these kind of
[43:30] things because
[43:32] they don't want to be around those
[43:35] things. And then you think well okay but
[43:38] maybe not enough people want to do that.
[43:40] Maybe not enough people care. Well maybe
[43:43] and I think the I I don't I I don't
[43:46] advocate any particular solution for
[43:48] this problem. I'm not talking about it
[43:50] from the perspective of yeah, we need to
[43:52] have societies that are um weed-free. I
[43:56] think we'll have places where weed is
[43:57] allowed, places where people don't want
[43:59] weed. And then I think the reason why
[44:02] people are going to want to go to the
[44:03] places that don't have weed is because
[44:05] these places are likely to be more
[44:07] peaceful, um better for raising
[44:09] children, more uh accommodating for
[44:13] capital accumulation and civilization in
[44:14] general. And so it's I think you know
[44:18] and Hopper is is is pretty brutal in
[44:21] this criticism what he calls the la
[44:23] libertarians which is that he says look
[44:26] if you want the you know you should have
[44:28] the right to do whatever you want with
[44:31] your own property.
[44:34] However history has a lot of lessons for
[44:37] us and it shows us how societies
[44:39] function. So we have not developed
[44:42] civilizations in societies that have
[44:45] been completely permissive to all kinds
[44:47] of um behavior. There's a reason that
[44:50] societies that have developed
[44:52] civilization, that have been able to
[44:53] develop a concept of property rights,
[44:55] that have been able to develop peaceful
[44:57] coexistence, have some forms of common
[45:00] norms that they've adopted that have
[45:03] allowed for this. And so one of these
[45:07] is some form of social ostracism or
[45:11] restrictions against drugs, which you
[45:13] know doesn't necessarily mean that
[45:14] everybody's been sober at all times, but
[45:17] I think the it it does mean that there
[45:20] is a social stigma around it. So that
[45:25] even the people who do it do it
[45:26] underground and don't do it openly. And
[45:29] I think this is a pretty common thing. I
[45:32] don't think you'll find many societies
[45:34] where people engaged in a lot of um drug
[45:37] use that ended up developing high
[45:40] civilization. I think another major one
[45:42] is family and so you can expect to see
[45:46] that whereas you know in the last couple
[45:49] of decades because of I believe you know
[45:52] the the in invention of the pill and
[45:54] contraception as well as the development
[45:57] of much lower time preference behavior.
[46:00] All of these things have led to a lot
[46:02] more sexual liberation. And I think
[46:04] people think of this as being
[46:06] advancement. I think most people,
[46:07] particularly young people, when they're,
[46:09] you know, overcome with hormones. Uh
[46:11] before you, uh before you start having
[46:14] kids, you know, you you think of this as
[46:16] being the a lot of people think of this
[46:17] as being the, you know, the the pinnacle
[46:19] of human liberty and human uh
[46:22] achievement is to be able to be
[46:24] liberated sexually.
[46:27] But the point is if you want
[46:30] civilization you have to give up on
[46:32] that. That this is a very very very
[46:34] powerful lesson of history. There's a
[46:36] great book written in the 1930s by um by
[46:40] British sociologist called JD Unwin and
[46:42] it's called Sex and Culture and he
[46:44] examines how civilizations
[46:47] only emerge in places that have very
[46:50] strict restrictions on uh sexuality. In
[46:53] particular, he finds that high
[46:55] civilization is only developed in purely
[46:58] monogous societies. And there's a reason
[47:01] for that. And so when people think that
[47:03] they can have the fruits of civilization
[47:06] without needing to planting the seeds,
[47:09] without needing to plant the seeds for
[47:11] it, then you're in end times territory.
[47:16] You're in the generation that is
[47:18] basically cutting down the trees that
[47:20] their uh ancestors built and leaving no
[47:24] trees behind for their children.
[47:26] Essentially, the boomer generation is is
[47:30] the advertisement for this because, you
[47:33] know, in the 60s and 70s this stuff
[47:35] seemed harmless. Well, now we've got the
[47:38] pill and we have female liberation and
[47:41] we can just do whatever we want. We have
[47:43] modern technology. We are advanced. we
[47:45] don't need to live in the old tribal
[47:48] traditional forms of society. We don't
[47:50] need religion. We don't need God. And so
[47:52] we can just continue to do whatever we
[47:54] want. And it sounded like a good idea
[47:56] for most people in the 1960s and '7s
[47:58] because it didn't sound what like what
[48:00] could go wrong. You know, everybody just
[48:02] uh is sexually liberated and everything.
[48:04] Combine that idea and then oneshot them
[48:06] all with LSD and then you get basically
[48:09] what happened. This is it was it was
[48:11] very well executed. Um well I mean I
[48:15] mean sorry but I'm I'm not even sure
[48:16] that you could say that there was some
[48:18] kind of nefarious agenda here because
[48:20] this is what happened with civilizations
[48:23] with civilizations all over time in that
[48:25] yeah it starts off fun in the 60s and
[48:27] 70s this was fun but totally the the
[48:30] children that came from this then had
[48:32] the children that came from this that
[48:34] then today lead us to the mess that you
[48:38] see and I think you know a lot of the uh
[48:40] you know a lot of people like to uh talk
[48:43] about the insanities of modern gender uh
[48:47] and sexuality and all of this craziness
[48:49] that is uh you know um as as we speak
[48:53] Trump is likely going to reverse a lot
[48:55] of that at least nominally from a
[48:58] government position. But I think this
[49:01] stuff is not just some kind of
[49:04] um
[49:06] outlier where a few people have been
[49:09] pushing this agenda on society. I think
[49:11] this has been a long time coming. This
[49:13] is the inevitable consequence of that.
[49:15] So when you you know these these are the
[49:17] grandkids of the generations of the 60s
[49:20] and 70s who thought what's the worst
[49:22] that can happen? What's the worst that
[49:23] can happen is that your kid is going to
[49:25] have drag queen story. He's going to
[49:27] chop off his dick basically. Yeah. He's
[49:29] going to have his dick chopped off at
[49:30] seven years old because he once played
[49:32] with a Barbie and that that's you know
[49:35] and and and that's just what we know
[49:37] now. You know who knows what's going to
[49:38] be the case for 10 20 years from now. So
[49:41] this kind of thing will lead to people
[49:43] recognizing this. You'll realize that
[49:44] places where they don't do this um
[49:47] insane nonsense end up having
[49:49] functioning societies end up having
[49:51] functioning sewage, electricity and
[49:53] buildings. And you'll realize that if
[49:55] you want those things, you need to abide
[49:57] by the rules of civilization. I think if
[49:59] we have freedom, if we have more freedom
[50:01] and less government intervention, we'll
[50:02] be able to arrive at the forms of social
[50:05] organizations that are best optimized
[50:08] for society to
[50:10] thrive. But it I don't believe it means
[50:13] the what terms the Laala libertarian
[50:16] viewpoint of just everybody indulge all
[50:19] of your desires at all times and never
[50:22] restrict yourself or delay
[50:23] gratification. That's not how
[50:25] civilization works. Healthcare is one of
[50:27] the biggest problems in fiat world and
[50:28] health insurance in particular. In my
[50:30] work and on this podcast, we've
[50:32] discussed at length the many ways in
[50:34] which modern medicine and insurance
[50:36] fail. And I'm very proud to be

[51:29] a f. I couldn't agree more. I mean the
[51:33] 10th virtue in the book is restraint and
[51:35] selfrestraint is the capacity to limit
[51:38] your own freedoms. But I I want to pull
[51:39] on a couple threads. So, a bunch of what
[51:41] you talked about reminds me of the
[51:43] saying just because you can doesn't mean
[51:45] you should. And I think that should be
[51:48] like stamped or branded on a bunch of
[51:51] libertarians minds. It's like just
[51:52] because you can, you know, go and take
[51:54] drugs and do whatever you want doesn't
[51:55] mean you actually should. There there
[51:57] are standards which to me this is a
[52:00] standards are an interesting word
[52:02] because in in many ways they're somewhat
[52:04] antithetical to liberty or maybe
[52:06] antithetical is not the right word but
[52:07] it's it's it's a tricky situation when
[52:09] you want a
[52:10] standard but you also want the freedom
[52:13] to you know often uh ignore that
[52:16] standard right a standard is in many
[52:18] ways either a limitation or a bar or a
[52:21] restriction of some sort right it's a
[52:22] bounding box so it's like what you're
[52:25] describing about societies uh that may
[52:28] not for example tolerate all right we're
[52:30] not going to tolerate weed or junkies or
[52:32] this or that or whatever that is a
[52:34] standard and the
[52:37] tradeoff for a standard is a limitation
[52:40] or an imposition on a freedom right like
[52:42] you you can't just have it all and this
[52:44] is for for me as well the the older I
[52:46] get the more mature I get is like you
[52:48] realize you can't have it all there are
[52:50] trade-offs and I want to I want to read
[52:52] a um a passage here from the book which
[52:55] kind talks to a lot of what we've been
[52:57] talking about. So the quote is it's not
[53:01] freedom that you actually want. What you
[53:03] actually want is agency and autonomy.
[53:06] Freedom is a nebulous term like
[53:09] spirituality which devoid of a clearly
[53:11] divide uh clearly defined frame doesn't
[53:14] mean anything. At that point we are
[53:17] talking specifically about autonomy. The
[53:19] capacity to choose from a set of
[53:20] available options. Absolute freedom is
[53:22] absolute chaos which doesn't really
[53:24] exist or if it does is unstable or
[53:27] unsuitable for life. Freedom maximalism
[53:29] quickly falls apart with one question.
[53:31] Where does your freedom end considering
[53:34] it may be in conflict with my freedom?
[53:36] This conundrum proves that freedom is
[53:38] only meaningful if it exists within a
[53:40] framework of duties, responsibilities
[53:42] and boundaries which is really the
[53:44] definition of autonomy. And if you
[53:46] really want to enhance your freedom, you
[53:48] need to increase your responsibility and
[53:50] the boundary of your domain which
[53:53] requires power. You are not entitled to
[53:55] freedom. You can only earn it. When
[53:57] someone tries to unjustly take what you
[53:59] have earned, you must fight to protect
[54:01] it. And you cannot do that without
[54:02] taking responsibility or having property
[54:05] which requires power. So consider the
[54:07] military dictim. That rank hath its
[54:09] privileges. privileges can be understood
[54:11] as liberties or freedoms and that they
[54:14] come along with rank is not accidental
[54:16] because the privilege of rank implies
[54:18] the burden of responsibility. So this is
[54:20] kind of comes from the the freedom and
[54:22] responsibility chapter which is it it
[54:24] ties into many ways what you just
[54:26] mentioned before. It's these things come
[54:29] down to property and in fact I would
[54:31] argue that property is that which you
[54:34] have the capacity to protect or that
[54:37] which you are responsible for right it
[54:39] is your
[54:40] domain you know like so so there's um I
[54:43] know there's a bunch there if uh if
[54:45] you'd like to pull on those threads but
[54:46] this leads me to a discussion that I
[54:48] wanted to have with you which is why
[54:50] inevitably with all of these sorts of
[54:52] things going on I think the more you
[54:54] mature the more you come to the
[54:55] realization and that the ultimate
[54:58] uh means or mechanism for territorial
[55:01] organization boils down to monarchies. I
[55:04] I think they are where things end up
[55:07] because you like as soon as you go into
[55:10] you know one man one vote de democracy
[55:12] and all this sort of stuff you start to
[55:13] muddle the waters like all of these
[55:15] problems around standards get way
[55:18] trickier to um to contend with in that
[55:22] kind of a framework whereas in a you
[55:24] know a monarchic framework or in the
[55:26] book I call it kind of executive states.
[55:28] I kind of paint a picture of the future
[55:30] where we have almost like CEO kings um
[55:33] operating territories and you know these
[55:35] territories are run more like some blend
[55:37] of a company and a monarchy right and
[55:39] you have a contractual relationship with
[55:41] the territorial operator but yeah these
[55:45] the the the freedom liberty
[55:47] responsibility like that cluster of
[55:50] things there um you know with standards
[55:52] and everything else in there is um is
[55:54] tricky and as you said like the the
[55:57] young naive uh immature
[56:00] conceptualization of freedom or lobert
[56:04] libertarians, right, which I call them
[56:06] LA libertarians, like they haven't
[56:07] thought these things through. And as you
[56:09] said, often they're people who either
[56:12] don't have kids or they're young or
[56:14] they're, you know, full of, you know,
[56:16] testosterone or whatever and they just
[56:18] want to do whatever they want, right?
[56:19] they they haven't thought a little bit
[56:20] deeper about what are the consequences
[56:23] for these decisions that I make as an
[56:25] individual for the community, tribe or
[56:29] territory that I live within. Um, and
[56:31] those things are much harder to contend
[56:33] with. Yeah, I think you know what you
[56:36] said is what you're looking for is
[56:38] autonomy and agency. And I think this is
[56:41] very much in the Hoppian um mold, but
[56:45] the the kind of economist way of
[56:47] describing this in a more economically
[56:50] precise language is property. It's how
[56:54] you know you said the question is how do
[56:56] you conf what happens when your freedom
[56:58] conflicts with mine? And the answer is
[57:01] property rights. You can do whatever you
[57:02] want on your land. I can do whatever I
[57:04] want on my land and or whatever we
[57:08] agreed to be doing. So if you have
[57:10] clearly defined property rights, then
[57:12] freedom becomes the the consequence of
[57:15] that. And it's the freedom to be able to
[57:18] reap the rewards of what you
[57:20] um what you plant. Basically, it's not
[57:24] so much about being able to do
[57:25] everything. It's about being able
[57:27] to experience the consequences, good or
[57:30] bad. That's really what freedom is. So,
[57:32] a lot of people think, you know,
[57:34] libertarianism means people will get
[57:36] away with murder because there's no
[57:38] government. No. I think in a world in
[57:40] which we have real libertarianism in
[57:42] terms of property rights, then you it'll
[57:46] it'll be a lot harder for people to get
[57:47] away with murder than they can with
[57:49] government. Cuz ultimately what
[57:50] government does is that it uh you know,
[57:52] it pretends to be out there to protect
[57:54] people, but it really establishes a
[57:56] monopoly on violence. And so therefore,
[57:57] it creates a category of violence that
[57:59] is legitimate. And so it creates a class
[58:01] of society that is allowed to engage in
[58:04] violence and therefore this class of
[58:07] society has a uh different set of rules
[58:11] by which they play and I think this is
[58:13] truly corrupting of society in a sense
[58:15] because once you see that there's this
[58:18] growing always growing of obviously
[58:20] because people want to be part of this
[58:21] group uh this growing group of people
[58:25] who have the ability to commit crimes
[58:26] that you are unable to commit then the
[58:29] entire notion of wanting to take part in
[58:32] society and take part in civilized
[58:34] society, I think uh begins to fall
[58:37] apart. Um it's
[58:40] it's
[58:42] it's I think really one of the nefarious
[58:47] things that government does is that it
[58:49] introduces this idea that it's
[58:51] legitimate to have violence and
[58:53] therefore people start thinking of it in
[58:55] terms of how do I make it so that I'm
[58:57] the one who can have legitimate
[58:59] violence rather than just accepting that
[59:02] nobody should have legitimate violence
[59:03] and so therefore I should go and do
[59:05] something productive with my time. But
[59:06] if we have property rights then um you
[59:08] know if property rights override
[59:10] government then you have peace and
[59:12] prosperity and civilization. But if you
[59:13] have government overriding property
[59:15] rights it's going to override them all
[59:17] the time and it's going to abuse that
[59:18] privilege all the time. So here's a
[59:21] question for you. How do we and and this
[59:23] is something I contend with in in the
[59:24] book a little bit but I I intend to in
[59:26] the next couple of years write something
[59:28] uh more dedicated to it. But how does
[59:31] one create a framework in which property
[59:35] rights uh can be protected and enforced
[59:40] because it you know the the things get
[59:43] tricky for example like let's say the
[59:45] you know there's this whole mass
[59:46] immigration discussion now right is like
[59:48] you bring people from external cultures
[59:50] into your culture and your culture might
[59:53] respect private property rights and have
[59:54] this sort of implicit ability to agree
[59:56] on things but then you start to import a
[59:58] bunch of people who that notion of
[60:00] property rights is completely foreign to
[60:02] them. They they've never grown up with
[60:03] it. It's never been in their culture,
[60:04] never been in their DNA. It's outside to
[60:06] them. So then they don't uh live by
[60:09] those property rights and then obviously
[60:10] they get a vote and all this sort of
[60:12] happens and all of a sudden you know the
[60:13] the concept of property rights start to
[60:15] fall apart. So how does one uh in your
[60:18] in your mind operate a territory in such
[60:21] a way that property rights are uh
[60:24] respected? you know, does the territory
[60:26] operator have a monopoly on the
[60:30] violence? Like, you know, is this is
[60:32] sort of what where I end up coming back
[60:33] to the monarch, right? Or or uh, you
[60:36] know, a CEO king. So, talk talk me
[60:38] through your thinking there. Yeah. Yeah.
[60:40] No, that's a that's another one of these
[60:41] great ideas that um I think grown-up
[60:44] libertarianism, as I like to call it,
[60:46] the hapa branch of libertarianism, has a
[60:49] coherent answer for that. The LA
[60:51] libertarians don't because the I think
[60:54] the uh LA libertarian position of you
[60:57] know governments are illegitimate,
[60:58] states are illegitimate and therefore
[61:00] borders don't matter and therefore
[61:02] people get to move around. I don't think
[61:04] that is coherent. And I think uh hapa
[61:07] makes a good case for saying look even
[61:10] if you don't support the government say
[61:12] you don't support the idea of public
[61:14] libraries so you don't like the idea of
[61:16] government taxing people in order to
[61:18] build public libraries which I believe
[61:20] is a fair position. I think in a free
[61:22] society people would build libraries
[61:23] voluntarily without having to be um
[61:26] extorted to build the library. Yes they
[61:28] did. Yeah. And they did. But so if you
[61:31] have a public library today in a city
[61:33] and you don't believe in public
[61:35] libraries, that doesn't necessarily mean
[61:37] that you support the right of random
[61:39] hobos to get into the library and squat
[61:43] it and call it theirs. So it's not
[61:45] unowned property that somebody can come
[61:47] in and squat in and you know random
[61:50] homeless people get into the library and
[61:52] start burning all the old books to stay
[61:54] warm and throw a party in it. Well,
[61:56] aren't you an anarchist? Aren't you a
[61:58] libertarian? Don't you oppose the
[62:00] government? Those people are sticking it
[62:02] to the man, sticking it to the
[62:03] government. They've ruined a
[62:04] 300-year-old library and turned it into
[62:06] a giant bonfire. Um, you should be
[62:09] happy, right? No, I'm not happy with
[62:11] that. I don't want that to happen.
[62:13] Ideally, I'd want the public library to
[62:15] be privatized. I want to have an owner
[62:17] of the library because I believe that
[62:18] would be a better way of protecting the
[62:20] library. But meanwhile, if I see a
[62:22] homeless person
[62:24] uh defecating inside the library, I'm
[62:27] not just going to say, "Oh, well, you
[62:28] know, it's government property, so that
[62:31] means he can do whatever he wants." No,
[62:33] the fact that it is government property
[62:34] means that it should be managed to the
[62:37] benefit of the taxpayer. The taxpayers
[62:40] are the on paying for this. And so, I
[62:42] don't believe this is a perfect way of
[62:43] arranging things. I would rather just
[62:45] have a person open a library and take
[62:48] donations or charge a fee or
[62:51] whatever. But it is what it is right now
[62:53] when we have the library and we're not
[62:54] going to get rid of nice things just
[62:56] because we don't um support the
[63:00] government. Another great example would
[63:02] be um let's just say think of think
[63:05] think of a situation where there is a um
[63:07] somebody who's kidnapping someone and
[63:09] you see somebody snatch a child and he's
[63:10] running away with a child and you see a
[63:13] policeman and he's got a gun and he can
[63:15] shoot the guy and stop him and he's a
[63:17] very good shot. He can shoot him in the
[63:18] legs, make sure he hits him and um
[63:21] doesn't hurt the child. Now the
[63:24] policeman is funded with
[63:25] taxation. Taxation is theft. So, as a
[63:28] libertarian, does that mean that you
[63:30] would oppose the policeman shooting the
[63:32] kidnapper so that the kidnapper can just
[63:36] get away with kidnapping someone's
[63:38] child? No. There is the evil of the
[63:40] kidnapping right now. And the fact that
[63:42] the policeman is being paid through
[63:44] taxation and the bullet is being paid
[63:46] for through taxation, which is
[63:48] illegitimate, does not invalidate the
[63:52] need to deal with the kidnapper. I'd
[63:55] rather be in a place where kidnappers
[63:56] get shot and killed rather than rather
[63:59] than be in a place where we get to
[64:01] quibble all day about the morality of
[64:03] the police and what should we do with
[64:05] the police. The reality is the public
[64:06] library exists, the policemen exist, and
[64:09] the roads exist. The roads are funded by
[64:11] the government. And I'm not going to not
[64:13] ever go on a road because it is funded
[64:14] by the government. This is the reality
[64:16] of what it is. And so with this frame of
[64:20] mind, when you think about it from the
[64:21] concept of um immigration, I think you
[64:26] ideally you would want to have
[64:27] everything be private property. And then
[64:29] if things are in private property, I
[64:31] think you would see that people would
[64:34] get into um voluntary arrangements that
[64:38] will exclude people from being part of
[64:41] it. And I think that's going to be a lot
[64:42] more common than people think. I think
[64:44] uh governments have in a sense
[64:48] undermined property rights which has
[64:51] made it so that a lot of the surface
[64:53] area of a particular city or country is
[64:56] essentially unowned and therefore people
[64:59] can squat onto it and people can enter
[65:01] into it and people can go into
[65:03] geographic regions by just simply
[65:04] getting a paper from u an embassy or by
[65:08] just um you know
[65:12] um crossing borders between countries.
[65:15] But I think in a free world, in a truly
[65:18] free world, that doesn't mean that, you
[65:21] know, the freedom of an immigrant to go
[65:23] in a to a place that he doesn't have
[65:26] anything to do in and to have the
[65:30] ability to go around and benefit from a
[65:32] civilization that he and his parents did
[65:34] not contribute to would be subject to
[65:37] the acceptance of the people who built
[65:39] that civilization, the people who own
[65:41] the property there. So you would get
[65:43] think about the example of gated
[65:44] community. I think you'd have gated
[65:46] communities and they'd have clear strict
[65:48] criteria about what it means to enter
[65:50] here. So in this community we're all
[65:52] Christians. We all want to live in a
[65:53] society that's all Catholic Christians.
[65:56] And so only people who are Catholic
[65:58] Christians are allowed to buy property
[66:00] in this area. We're only going to be
[66:01] selling to Catholic Christians. And if
[66:04] you decide to become an atheist, um you
[66:07] know there are certain criteria. You got
[66:09] to attend church maybe once a month at
[66:11] least or some kind of criteria to
[66:13] guarantee it. And I and and if you truly
[66:16] believe in freedom, I mean, freedom
[66:17] isn't just drugs and sex. What about if
[66:20] I want to live in a society where I want
[66:23] my children to share the faith that of
[66:26] the kids in their school? I want them to
[66:28] play with people with the same values. I
[66:30] think that's a freedom and I think that
[66:32] is a freedom that will happen in a more
[66:35] free society that people will impose
[66:37] these kind of rules that say okay well
[66:40] we are going to mandate that in this
[66:43] area only people from this particular
[66:45] faith are allowed to come here or you
[66:48] know you can imagine something happening
[66:50] where for instance in the cities where
[66:52] you're likely going to need more of a
[66:55] diverse kind of labor force where you're
[66:57] going to benefit from having people then
[66:59] you would have areas and cities or maybe
[67:00] the centers of cities that would have u
[67:03] that would that would have pretty open
[67:04] immigration policies. But then think
[67:06] about the suburbs outside that it would
[67:08] be pretty exclusionary and there'd be
[67:10] gated communities and it might be the
[67:13] case that uh very large geographic areas
[67:16] voluntarily choose to uh accept these
[67:20] kind of restrictions. So I don't believe
[67:23] in this. I I I think Hopp has um
[67:26] convinced me on the idea that open
[67:28] borders is not the libertarian
[67:30] positions. Yeah. Open borders too. Yeah.
[67:32] Yeah. The idea borders are just uh a
[67:34] libertarian world is a world in which
[67:36] every single inch is owned and so there
[67:38] is nothing to be open. Anywhere you go
[67:41] you're crossing onto somebody's property
[67:43] and so you need to abide by their rules.
[67:44] There are no roads for you to go and be
[67:46] a hobo on. Every single road is owned by
[67:50] somebody and that person can impose
[67:51] whatever restrictions they want. they
[67:54] could impose the death penalty for um
[67:56] sleeping on the street if they choose to
[67:59] and you only enter into that street when
[68:00] you agree to abide by this. So in that
[68:03] kind of world, you'd get more and more
[68:05] of this kind of
[68:07] um these kind of restrictions and I
[68:09] think it would mean I mean looking
[68:13] around at what's going on in Europe in
[68:16] particular. I mean this kind of mass
[68:17] immigration phenomena I don't think this
[68:19] would happen in a free society and it
[68:21] didn't happen in the 19th century which
[68:23] I believe was in many ways a more free
[68:26] society because they had the gold
[68:27] standard. They had limited governments
[68:29] and they had monarchies and I think this
[68:31] is a key point here. So I don't
[68:35] necessarily think that monarchy is
[68:37] always the solution everywhere. Uh for
[68:40] me you know kings can be bad and
[68:42] parliaments can be bad. I think
[68:44] parliaments are more likely to be bad
[68:46] but there are good examples of republics
[68:49] that haven't been a complete failure.
[68:52] Switzerland is one. So I think but but I
[68:56] still think monarchy is more likely to
[68:59] be conducive to this kind of solution
[69:01] because monarchy essentially formalizes
[69:05] the uh property all all of the property
[69:09] that is not owned and makes it
[69:11] effectively the property of the king.
[69:13] And so then you have that formalism of
[69:15] the idea that since the king owns all of
[69:17] those things, you can't just trespass.
[69:20] And the king has a long-term interest.
[69:22] He wants to have his kids and grandkids
[69:24] and great great great great grandkids in
[69:28] charge. So he's got a very low time
[69:30] preference. He's interested in keeping
[69:32] you as a citizen as a subject. He's
[69:36] interested in making you prosperous
[69:38] enough so that your great great great
[69:41] grandchildren will be prosperous enough
[69:42] for his great great great grandchildren
[69:45] to be able to tax. So he's interested in
[69:48] peace. He's interested in development.
[69:50] He's interested in growth. He's
[69:51] interested in capital accumulation. He's
[69:53] interested in civilization. And I
[69:55] believe in that kind of world, you're
[69:56] likely going to see a lot more
[69:58] restrictions on
[70:00] immigration. Or I think alternatively,
[70:03] what you would see is you look at the
[70:04] model of places like Dubai or the
[70:06] Emirates where you have an enormous
[70:08] amount of immigration, but there's a
[70:10] very clear idea of res. Exactly. So
[70:14] you're a resident and they're very clear
[70:16] rules about what you're allowed to do
[70:17] and what you're not allowed to do. And
[70:20] if you don't want it, you don't come.
[70:22] And I think it's, you know, it's it's
[70:23] really telling. People in the West like
[70:25] to hate on Dubai and Saudi Arabia, and a
[70:28] lot of people talk about it being
[70:29] slavery, that it's built on slave labor,
[70:32] which is idiotic, because there are
[70:35] hundreds of millions of people who are
[70:37] eager to move to the Arab Gulf today. I
[70:40] mean I am sure there are hundreds of
[70:42] millions of people all over the world in
[70:44] Asia, Africa, Latin America, North
[70:46] America, Europe, Australia who would
[70:50] move there if they could have the
[70:51] chance. And um they move there even
[70:54] though they don't get a vote, they don't
[70:56] get to take part in politics, there's no
[70:58] demonstration, there's no political
[70:59] activism, none of that stuff. And yet
[71:02] they move there and and you know I used
[71:03] to live in Lebanon and Lebanese people
[71:06] you know Lebanon is a massively
[71:07] dysfunctional country politically. It's
[71:10] a republic and a parliament that's
[71:11] designed by the French and they have 18
[71:13] sects and everything is based on sect
[71:16] and so it's just massively massively
[71:18] dysfunctional and of course everybody
[71:20] has very strong opinions about how the
[71:22] country needs to be run and everybody
[71:24] believes that you know if only me and
[71:26] the right people like me were made u
[71:29] president then everything would be fixed
[71:31] and yet probably a majority of Lebanese
[71:34] people would move to Dubai if they could
[71:37] and the Gulf I think probably I don't
[71:39] really know the numbers, but there might
[71:41] be more Lebanese people in the Gulf
[71:44] countries than there are in Lebanon at
[71:46] this point. Maybe not quite as much, but
[71:48] a very significant number of Lebanese
[71:50] people have been in Saudi Arabia and the
[71:52] Emirates and Kuwait and Qatar for
[71:54] decades. And they go there and suddenly
[71:57] all of their strong ideas about politics
[71:59] are just completely out of the window.
[72:02] They no longer want activism. They no
[72:04] longer want to vote. They no longer want
[72:05] to have very strong opinions about how
[72:07] the country is run. They sign their
[72:09] contract, they go there, they behave and
[72:11] they get paid and they live a decent
[72:13] life much better life than the life that
[72:15] they would have had in Lebanon or you
[72:17] know for many other people from all over
[72:19] from India and Nepal and uh um
[72:22] everywhere and you know Australia as
[72:24] well lots of refugees from Australia and
[72:27] uh in Dubai now they get a better life
[72:30] because there's a king and a king runs
[72:32] the country with the perspective of
[72:33] making sure that it is functioning 100
[72:36] years from now. And of course, it's not
[72:37] perfect. Of course, they have all kinds
[72:38] of problems there. But the streets are
[72:41] clean, the electricity works 24/7, the
[72:44] infrastructure is impeccable, and
[72:46] everything is very, very, very safe.
[72:48] There's very little climbing from these
[72:50] places. There's trade-offs. And this is
[72:51] the thing you realize as you get older,
[72:53] right? Is like each one of these things
[72:54] has a trade-off. Like if you just want
[72:56] to make everything free, liberal, and
[72:59] you know, anyone can do whatever they
[73:00] want, well, don't be surprised to turn
[73:03] your whole civilization into San
[73:04] Francisco, right? And then if you want
[73:06] to take the alternate trade-offs um you
[73:10] know I use Dubai as a massive um example
[73:13] in the book actually and I talk
[73:14] specifically about that. So 93% of the
[73:17] Arab Emirates population is non-
[73:20] Emiratis. You cannot sustain your
[73:24] country your ethnicity without having a
[73:27] multi-ter system where your people by
[73:30] blood are the only ones who get to
[73:32] assemble and get to vote. Simple as
[73:34] that. And and the funny thing is the
[73:37] this isn't funny. The tragic thing is
[73:39] the
[73:40] west the European blood was like that.
[73:43] You look at Rhodesia, South Africa,
[73:45] America, they were all like that
[73:47] originally and when they changed, you
[73:50] know, to make it equal for everybody,
[73:52] their countries got overrun. I mean, do
[73:55] do you are you familiar with the story
[73:56] of Rhodesia?
[73:58] Um, not so much vaguely, but yeah, go
[74:00] ahead. So, you know, a lot of Bitcoiners
[74:03] talk about, oh, yeah, Zimbabwe, you
[74:04] know, went into hyperinflation because
[74:06] they printed trillions of dollars.
[74:08] That's actually not
[74:10] true. Zimbabwe, the the the
[74:13] hyperinflation occurred as a result of
[74:16] Rhdesia becoming Zimbabwe. It happened
[74:20] before the money printing started. The
[74:22] money printing was a symptom of the
[74:24] collapse of the prior society. So
[74:26] previously, Rhdesia was like close to
[74:29] like a like a a landed republic, right?
[74:32] So you only got a vote. You only got a
[74:35] say in politics if you had a threshold
[74:39] of property ownership, right? And it it
[74:43] stood in stark contrast with the rest of
[74:47] the world because after World War II, as
[74:49] we know, the whole democracy, liberal
[74:51] democracy was being rammed down
[74:53] everybody's throats as the panacea to
[74:56] all social problems,
[74:57] right? Rhdesia was the bread basket of
[75:02] the entire continent of Africa with less
[75:05] than 5 million people and it was a
[75:06] landlocked nation. They fed the entire
[75:08] continent of Africa and it was a landed
[75:14] republic. The West destroyed its own
[75:18] ally by embargoing its own ally when it
[75:22] needed arms when the Chinese communists
[75:24] and the Russian communists went in and
[75:26] attacked it. And they held off two of
[75:28] the biggest powers. They held off both
[75:30] China and Russia by themselves as a tiny
[75:33] population to maintain their way of life
[75:36] because they had this thing working for
[75:38] almost a century and of course after the
[75:41] embargo after the UK and the US turned
[75:43] their backs on them you know when they
[75:45] were infected with this idea of
[75:46] democracy and all this kind of there's a
[75:48] whole story there um they their own ally
[75:52] Rodesia collapsed
[75:54] failed Mugabi got in they installed
[75:56] Mugabi as the new leader of the
[75:58] democratic Republic of
[76:00] Zimbabwe. They killed off all the
[76:02] farmers. They took all the property and
[76:04] then the the country collapsed. Then
[76:07] they started printing money. And the
[76:09] reason the money didn't work because
[76:11] people had no faith in the new
[76:14] governance. Right? So the way I look at
[76:16] you know money is like money is a
[76:18] function of people's faith in it.
[76:20] Bitcoin is building a track record of a
[76:23] kind of money that you can have the
[76:26] utmost faith in. Right? And therefore it
[76:29] provides the basis of a civilization
[76:32] where people can start to be low time
[76:33] preference. If you live in a society
[76:36] where you know you just got toppled and
[76:38] all of your best people got either
[76:40] killed or their property taken and all
[76:42] this sort of stuff and then you say well
[76:44] don't worry you know I'm going to print
[76:45] a bunch of money and give it to you.
[76:46] Like you have zero faith in that it's
[76:48] going to collapse. So, I've gone off on
[76:50] a tangent here, but it it reminds me of
[76:52] like the West used to know this and
[76:55] we've buried it all and we've buried it
[76:58] in this sort of guilt of, oh, you know,
[77:00] we colonized some people and now we
[77:02] should pay for all the the price and the
[77:05] consequences and everything like that.
[77:06] We should, you know, adopt this
[77:09] libertine policy of uh, you know,
[77:13] opening everything and bending over and
[77:15] letting anybody do whatever the they
[77:16] want. Um, and that has led us to the
[77:20] point as we said earlier is like your
[77:22] kids chopping off their dicks. Like it's
[77:24] it's not a good outcome. Like that
[77:26] should be the measure of society, right?
[77:28] Like if your kids are chopping off your
[77:30] dicks, your society has failed. Like not
[77:32] the GDP or how much growth you had or
[77:34] how much the stock market went up. Like
[77:36] children chopping off their genitals.
[77:38] That's the that's the measure of
[77:40] society. And if it if they're not doing
[77:41] that, then guess what? you have the
[77:44] makings of a better society than um than
[77:47] you do the alternate way irrespective of
[77:49] all the the you know the micro details.
[77:52] Yeah. No, I think that's a great point.
[77:54] I think you know recently remember the
[77:56] migration uh the H1B visa debate that
[78:00] became quite a
[78:04] stomach storm on Twitter in
[78:07] particular and in particular you know it
[78:09] was Elon Musk and uh VC Ramaswami who
[78:14] um you could say shot themselves in the
[78:16] foot or their foot in their mouth by
[78:20] this and I think one of one of the very
[78:21] ridiculous ideas which I would have been
[78:24] more sympathetic to uh in an earlier
[78:27] time before reading a lot of Hopper is
[78:29] this kind of well you know we need to
[78:30] get the best engineers in the world so
[78:32] that we can compete with China so that
[78:35] we can beat China and it fundamentally
[78:38] misunderstands what society is. It it it
[78:41] it takes the analogy of a sports team
[78:45] and applies it to a society. And I think
[78:47] the extension of this analogy and I've
[78:49] seen several people make this tweet
[78:50] which is you know you don't replace your
[78:52] child if somebody finds you a child
[78:54] who's better at math. You know you don't
[78:55] walk around looking for somebody who's
[78:58] better at math or somebody who's going
[78:59] to make a better income when he grows up
[79:02] and then you just go and get rid of your
[79:03] child and replace him or you know you
[79:05] adopt people based on the fact that
[79:06] they're going to uh provide you with a a
[79:10] better income. Um, I mean, of course
[79:13] there are good reasons to adopt people
[79:15] and maybe this is the case, but your
[79:17] child is your child and you try and give
[79:19] your child the best life possible
[79:21] because he's your child. And of course,
[79:23] you'd like him to succeed. You'd like
[79:25] him to do good things, but
[79:29] it's his life, his existence is not a
[79:32] competition with other people. And it's
[79:35] it's a very uh
[79:37] statist, you know, we're out there
[79:39] competing. No, we don't have to compete.
[79:40] We don't have to have the best engineers
[79:43] in the world in our country to be making
[79:44] everything. We can just import stuff
[79:46] from abroad. It's fine. They can stay in
[79:48] their country. They can make all the
[79:49] amazing things that they want to do and
[79:51] then we can just import them. And this
[79:53] is um this is becoming more and more
[79:56] obvious at this point because it's
[79:57] completely absurd to imagine the
[79:59] opposite. You know, this notion that in
[80:01] in in today's modern world, today's
[80:03] modern economy that the US could become
[80:06] self-sufficient is completely
[80:07] ridiculous. Not the US, not China. No
[80:09] country is truly self-sufficient. Even
[80:11] China with one and a half billion
[80:13] people and having essentially more than
[80:18] half of the world's steel capacity and a
[80:21] very large amount of um of the capacity
[80:25] of production for most of the world's
[80:26] most important uh economic goods. You
[80:29] know, most of the world's electronics
[80:30] and computers and everything is being
[80:32] made in China these days. And yet if you
[80:34] try to isolate China from the rest of
[80:36] the world, you would massively destroy
[80:38] the living standards of Chinese people.
[80:40] If they can't trade with the rest of the
[80:41] world, if they can buy and sell abroad,
[80:43] they are going to be a lot worse off. So
[80:45] this notion that you have to make
[80:47] everything in your country doesn't make
[80:49] sense. And this notion that your country
[80:50] is out there trying to win some Olympic
[80:53] gold medal in making productivity. Yeah.
[80:57] In productivity or in making widgets or
[80:59] making cell phones or making something.
[81:01] It's not true. That's not why a country
[81:02] exists. Just like your family is not out
[81:04] there to win anything. You love your
[81:07] family whether they're good at what they
[81:10] do or not. And you care for your child.
[81:12] And this notion that I mean you can sort
[81:14] of see this perhaps in the context of
[81:17] the US cuz the US has predominantly been
[81:21] a um an immigrant society. So you could
[81:24] say that US is always going to be a
[81:26] country that is well I mean some people
[81:30] would disagree with this but you could
[81:31] make it more of a case that the US is
[81:33] more of a country built around values
[81:35] than European countries which are really
[81:37] countries for a people that it's built
[81:39] around a people. this, you know, there's
[81:41] a place called Finland and there are
[81:43] people who are the Finnish people who
[81:44] have been living in Finland in that
[81:46] place. They have they own the property.
[81:47] They own the land and they've been there
[81:49] and Finland is not something that's made
[81:53] so that it can win a contest against
[81:54] other countries that there's no and also
[81:57] we can't all win all these context. It's
[82:00] it's not the Olympics where there's one
[82:01] golden medal and then we can compete.
[82:03] It's good to have all this competitive
[82:06] stuff. Get the outlet for it. h have a
[82:09] have an outlet for it which is sports.
[82:12] Um so you know be competitive about
[82:14] who's going to win the World Cup and
[82:15] who's going to get more Olympic medals
[82:18] but
[82:20] don't I I don't think it's very
[82:21] productive to think of your society as
[82:23] being something that needs to be
[82:26] out
[82:27] there. Over the last couple years, I've
[82:29] become I I must say uh kind of like a a
[82:34] a quasi statist or like a hoppian
[82:36] statist like I've got this framework I
[82:38] call it Christo Hoponichian and we'll
[82:40] get into that in a second. But you know
[82:42] your point here like the word nation and
[82:44] and I think this is um where things get
[82:47] conflated particularly among
[82:48] libertarians is like there's this real
[82:50] hatred for a state. It's like okay
[82:52] anything statism is bad but you know the
[82:54] nation state like the word natio means
[82:58] your kin it means your your people right
[83:00] and and a nation state the the original
[83:03] incarnation of it you know sure it's
[83:04] devolved and it's changed and all this
[83:06] sort of stuff but it it demarcated a
[83:09] territory that was more than just an
[83:11] economic zone which is what you're
[83:12] talking about here is like it was a
[83:14] cultural zone. And it's it's a it's a
[83:15] zone of your people who have particular
[83:17] norms, have particular uh uh way of
[83:21] thinking, have a particular you know,
[83:22] genetic uh um and ethnos like a shared
[83:26] ethnos and all this sort of stuff. And
[83:27] you know, the nation states duty is
[83:30] first and foremost to its people like
[83:33] and and you can't just look at your
[83:35] people like uh spreadsheet entries,
[83:37] right? It's like okay well you know we
[83:39] look at this spreadsheet entry on the
[83:40] dimension of computer science and we you
[83:42] know bring them in. that doesn't work
[83:44] like that. And even I mean the funny
[83:46] thing is all of the nerds and all of the
[83:49] um the you know the the people
[83:52] advocating for you know importation of
[83:54] people and all this kind of thing they
[83:56] know this in business because in
[83:58] business it's it's a very
[84:01] uh well-known uh axiom that you hire for
[84:05] culture first and skill second because
[84:07] you can always train skill but you
[84:09] cannot embed culture in someone. Now
[84:12] they say that about the cultural work
[84:14] environment but then they go and ignore
[84:16] it about the person's cultural life,
[84:19] genetics, blood, upbringing and
[84:21] everything like that. And and it it like
[84:23] these things are inconsistent. They're
[84:25] incoherent. And and it makes me think
[84:27] about, you know, earlier you said about
[84:29] uh Switzerland, right? Switzerland has
[84:31] managed to be this unique territory,
[84:34] this unique region that has been able to
[84:38] establish and run a successful republic
[84:41] for many many many centuries. You can't
[84:44] just do that everywhere. Like there
[84:46] there needs to be a uh you know there
[84:49] needs to be a culture or a cultural
[84:50] framework that can sustain a particular
[84:53] kind of uh governance, a particular kind
[84:56] of uh territorial operation. And I think
[84:58] it's very naive to think, for example,
[85:00] that the whole world can just be
[85:02] libertarian, that the whole world can
[85:03] just uh you know have the same type of
[85:06] uh cultural framework to support a type
[85:09] of um uh governance form. And and this
[85:14] is I I think in writing this book I've
[85:16] matured a lot in my views in that I I I
[85:19] come to recognize that hey what you
[85:22] really what the world really needs is
[85:23] something more of a patchwork of uh
[85:27] territorial different kind of
[85:29] territorial operations right it's like
[85:31] in some places monarchies are going to
[85:34] work better in some places republics are
[85:36] going to work better in some places I
[85:37] mean I don't know maybe communism works
[85:39] just fine in China and they can do it
[85:41] over there and that's their thing right
[85:42] like it's it's not our business to get
[85:44] involved in how they want to operate
[85:46] their ethnic boundary um and what they
[85:49] choose as their property and their
[85:50] territory, right? So, um you know, we
[85:53] can argue that, you know, communism and
[85:56] all of that sort of stuff is stupidity
[85:58] and everything, but they will themselves
[86:00] around and find out. Um I just actually
[86:02] it reminds me of um I just finished
[86:04] reading uh the book on Joe Kennedy, who
[86:07] was like the father of, you know, the
[86:09] founding father. I shouldn't say the
[86:10] founding father because obviously he had
[86:12] a um his great-grandfather came to
[86:14] America from Ireland but he the book is
[86:16] called the patriarch and man he had nine
[86:19] kids and it shows how he went from
[86:20] nothing he was like a you know Boston
[86:22] Irish kid bit of an outsider and he
[86:25] established a a massive fortune he was
[86:28] one of the you know top 100 richest
[86:30] people in America in his day and he was
[86:32] totally against all of the intervention
[86:35] in World War II um the the intervention
[86:38] of America he was against like the the
[86:40] spread of liberal democracy in America
[86:42] turning itself into an empire and all
[86:43] this sort of stuff. He was the original
[86:44] like uh make America great, you know,
[86:47] and keep America great kind of uh and
[86:50] you you just sort of see this um he he
[86:52] was ridiculed. He was uh laughed at um
[86:56] you know Roosevelt like kind of uh lied
[87:00] to him and you know kind
[87:02] of him over like behind his back when he
[87:05] was the ambassador of England and trying
[87:06] to keep America out of the war and all
[87:07] this sort of stuff. and you kind of
[87:08] start to realize
[87:13] um like these things are a hell of a lot
[87:16] trickier than what we think. Like
[87:19] practice is way harder than theory
[87:21] basically. And you can you can talk
[87:24] about theory all you want, but when it
[87:25] comes down to it in practice, it seems
[87:29] that the best kind of territories uh are
[87:33] operated within a framework that can
[87:35] sustain them. number one. And number
[87:37] two, they look very much over and over
[87:41] again like something that has internal
[87:43] cultural coherence and is often operated
[87:47] in something that looks like a monarchy.
[87:49] I mean, also a republic has more in
[87:52] common with a monarchy than it does with
[87:53] a democracy. Like that's another that
[87:55] people, you know, don't realize. Yeah.
[87:56] And I think the key thing is whatever
[87:58] you whatever form of uh whatever the
[88:02] form of politics that your republic is
[88:05] going to have, it's the way that I see
[88:08] it. It's more difficult to get the
[88:13] ruling power in a republic to have a low
[88:17] time preference perspective on things
[88:20] because you need to convince more
[88:21] people. In the case of a democracy, you
[88:22] need to convince 51% of people to have
[88:24] good ideas, which is almost impossible.
[88:27] In the case of a monarchy, you just need
[88:29] one guy. You just need the one guy to
[88:32] figure it out. And they're quite likely
[88:36] to figure it out because if they've in
[88:38] that family business, if the family's
[88:40] been in the business of government for a
[88:43] couple of generations, they've learned a
[88:45] thing or two. If you've had a few
[88:47] generations and you've managed to keep
[88:49] power for a few generations, then you
[88:51] have some foresight. You have some
[88:52] long-term perspective. You're able to
[88:55] take the low time preference decision.
[88:57] And then what really matters in the case
[88:59] of monarchy is that that family
[89:01] maintains that line of thinking
[89:03] generation after generation. And it's
[89:05] really a lot easier. So you're born and
[89:07] the day you're born, you know that one
[89:09] day you're going to be king. And not
[89:11] only you, but all of your brothers and
[89:12] all of your cousins, all of the people
[89:14] that are, you know, 50 50th in line for
[89:18] the throne in case there's some giant
[89:20] war where the top 49 people um in line
[89:23] for the throne get killed. Even the 50th
[89:26] guy is being essentially groomed to
[89:28] become king. And that's that's
[89:30] essentially what a royal family is. It's
[89:31] a very deep bench of people from a
[89:35] family that has a long culture of
[89:37] understanding how to rule. And all of
[89:40] these people are born from day one to
[89:42] handle this. So you look around at what
[89:44] uh monarchs do. I mean from day one
[89:48] they're out there doing things that are
[89:50] in the kind of public interest. They're
[89:52] um you know one guy handles is
[89:55] interested in football. So he works with
[89:57] the football federation and he helps use
[89:59] his connections with governments around
[90:00] the world to try and get um you know I'm
[90:03] speaking from the experience here in
[90:04] Jordan. you see what the royal family
[90:06] are doing and they're out there doing
[90:08] all kinds of uh public service thing,
[90:10] you know, interested in um helping the
[90:13] disabled, interested in promoting
[90:14] sports, interested in helping uh um
[90:17] develop businesses and all kinds of
[90:19] things. And all of that is really just
[90:22] like a deep bench for monarchy. But it's
[90:25] a lot easier to instill those values
[90:28] within one family and make sure that
[90:29] they continue within the family than it
[90:31] is to instill it in a giant society of
[90:34] tens or hundreds of millions of people
[90:37] because people are going within the
[90:40] context of democracy. You know, not only
[90:42] it's harder is it harder to teach those
[90:43] people, but also within the context of
[90:45] democracy where you can get to vote for
[90:48] taking other people's stuff, there's a
[90:50] very strong incentive to have a low to
[90:52] have a high time preference in the way
[90:53] that you behave. And you know the the
[90:55] proof is in the pudding. If you look at
[90:58] the what are the great civilizations
[91:00] that we see, we find that monarchy has
[91:04] generally always almost always almost
[91:06] been almost always been there. So the
[91:10] longest serving monarchy in the world,
[91:12] do you know which one it is? It's in
[91:14] Japan, right? It's in Japan. Exactly.
[91:16] It's been about 2,600 years. So there's
[91:20] been a royal family there for I think 50
[91:22] 60 gener No, sorry. about a hundred
[91:24] generations or something like that. Uh
[91:27] the the royal family has been there and
[91:29] you know Japan isn't exactly a terrible
[91:32] place to be. The second longest dynasty
[91:34] trivia quiz for the day. Do you know
[91:36] which one?
[91:38] I mean I'm going to just say Jordan
[91:40] because you're there. Am I That's the
[91:42] correct answer. Okay. The current king
[91:44] of Jordan is the 42nd uh generation
[91:48] descendant of uh the prophet Muhammad.
[91:51] So again, Islamic civilization, you can
[91:54] also think of it as being a monarchical
[91:56] patriarchal civilization. It's always
[91:58] been around the family of Muhammad who
[92:01] were in Mecca, but now they're in
[92:03] Jordan. But part of the reason that
[92:05] makes this country so stable and
[92:07] peaceful, you know, not a lot of people
[92:09] hear about Jordan
[92:10] because nothing bad usually happens in
[92:13] Jordan. So really is the Switzerland in
[92:16] the Middle East in a sense that uh over
[92:18] the last 100 years. All of the neighbors
[92:20] of Jordan have had all kinds of horrific
[92:22] wars and conflicts all the time and
[92:24] Jordan has practically stayed out of the
[92:26] vast majority of them and people in
[92:28] Jordan have been quite peaceful and I
[92:31] think a big part of that is because of
[92:32] the monarchy. So you see this all over
[92:35] the world. You see, you know, the great
[92:37] European civilizations came under
[92:39] monarchies. the British civil, the
[92:41] British, the Germans, the Spanish, there
[92:44] was all monarchies. And it was only in
[92:46] the 20th century that these monarchies
[92:48] um
[92:49] it's been like a deviation. It's been
[92:51] like a strange deviation where and and
[92:53] this is why I think, you know, World War
[92:54] I was the the death nail of the of the
[92:57] West was the whole point of World War I
[92:59] was to abolish all of them. Um I I want
[93:02] to I want to quickly say something. You
[93:04] were talking about monarchs and it just
[93:05] hit me now. It's
[93:06] like monarchs are basically a
[93:09] combination of nature and nurture for
[93:12] governance, right? Because they they
[93:14] they're almost like genetically born
[93:16] into it, but they were also nurtured
[93:17] their whole life for the purpose of
[93:20] governance. Yeah. Um which that that
[93:22] didn't occur to me before, but it's it's
[93:24] based on our conversation like it's a
[93:25] it's a mixture of both, which is what
[93:27] you want. You don't want to just get uh
[93:29] anybody in there. Yeah. It's very it's
[93:31] very unpopular thing to say in our
[93:33] egalitarian time, but I urge people to
[93:35] look at the uh Republican leaders. You
[93:38] know, I I've got a front seat to this
[93:41] looking at the Arab world. So, when you
[93:42] think about the leaders that uh came
[93:44] into power who weren't monarchs and you
[93:48] think of the of the sort of things that
[93:49] they did, so you compare for instance uh
[93:52] Saddam in Iraq versus the Hashemites who
[93:54] used to rule Iraq. The Hashemites ruled
[93:56] Iraq before uh Saddam and then they were
[93:59] removed. or you compare them to the
[94:01] Hashemites today in Jordan. So Saddam
[94:04] invaded most of his neighbors which was
[94:06] an extremely extremely stupid thing to
[94:09] do. Whatever um geopolitical context you
[94:11] have, it was just massively stupid and
[94:13] massively destructive. Invaded Iraq,
[94:15] invaded uh Iran. He came very close to
[94:18] fighting war against Syria. They were
[94:21] brutal enemies who hated each other and
[94:23] spied on each other and it was terrible.
[94:25] He had terrible relationships with
[94:26] pretty much everybody because he's not a
[94:30] king. He's he's he he he never really
[94:32] thought about power from the perspective
[94:33] of I want to secure this for my great
[94:36] great great grandchild. It was always I
[94:38] want to avenge this and I want to avenge
[94:40] that and I want to do this and that's
[94:42] just very high time preference behavior
[94:44] that is um inculcated into people
[94:49] who I mean well I shouldn't say
[94:51] inculcated I'd say this is the default.
[94:53] this is how people really are. And it
[94:56] takes a lot of restraint and a lot of
[94:58] nature and nurture combining to produce
[95:01] somebody who has the foresight to think,
[95:03] no, you know
[95:04] what, I can take Kuwait if I want to. I
[95:08] probably shouldn't, but I shouldn't.
[95:09] Exactly. Exactly. And this I mean this
[95:13] right there what you just described is
[95:15] why I wanted to write this book which is
[95:17] Bitcoiners are are going to in many ways
[95:20] be the leaders of the future world. Like
[95:23] you know when you are you know
[95:26] economically and therefore socially uh
[95:28] you know you have gravity um you you
[95:31] need to develop the virtues that make
[95:34] you worthy of that power of that
[95:36] capacity right you need to start to do
[95:38] that lest you become uh a degenerate
[95:42] right because like the future leaders of
[95:43] the world
[95:44] like many of the great Bitcoiners who go
[95:47] and cultivate these virtues inside
[95:50] themselves will be micro monarchs or
[95:53] potentially the future monarchs of the
[95:55] world, right? You know, we we are going
[95:56] to establish and build a new world from
[95:58] scratch because we killed off all the
[95:59] other royal families. You know, there's
[96:01] like three left now on the planet. So,
[96:03] we're going to have to rebuild
[96:04] civilization somehow. And when you
[96:06] combine the fact that the optimum
[96:09] territorial operation or the territorial
[96:13] organizational structure is something
[96:15] that looks more like a monarchy with the
[96:18] fact that there will be people who have
[96:22] extreme wealth because they got into
[96:23] Bitcoin early and were able to pass it
[96:24] on to their children and their
[96:25] children's children. you have the
[96:28] forming of a future in which you have a
[96:31] patchwork of territories that look more
[96:34] like um microates and uh what what I'm
[96:37] calling in the book executive states.
[96:39] That's kind of how I'm thinking about
[96:40] this and I think that's a that's a very
[96:44] interesting future at least in my
[96:46] opinion. you know, people get very
[96:48] offended when I talk about this, but
[96:50] it's um maybe I'm talking to the right
[96:52] audience here, so no one will be
[96:53] offended, but I mean, I I'm guessing
[96:57] people who listen to my podcast have
[96:58] seen a lot worse, so they've stuck
[97:00] around so far. They probably got a very
[97:03] high tolerance, so um yeah, I I I think
[97:07] this I mean, who knows? Maybe they'll
[97:09] they'll get angry about it. But, you
[97:11] know, I think it's very true. It's it's
[97:13] no coincidence that the move towards
[97:16] fiat money was the same time that the
[97:18] move away from from monarchies happened.
[97:21] And I think both are an aberration. It's
[97:23] a historical aberration that we live in
[97:25] a world government money. And it's a
[97:27] historical aberration that we live in a
[97:28] world in which the majority of
[97:29] territories are just, you know, run by
[97:32] this. Yeah. These bureaucrats,
[97:34] basically, these um midgets who come
[97:37] into power for four years and leave. Um
[97:41] Yeah. Yeah, I I call it the twin evils,
[97:43] fiat money and liberal democracy. Like
[97:45] those two things, you combine those and
[97:47] that's how you basically destroy the
[97:49] world. And you know, with Bitcoin, we
[97:52] must fix the money. And then through
[97:55] cultivating codes of virtue, through
[97:58] through cultivating a cultivating a way
[98:00] of life, uh we can develop into the kind
[98:05] of leaders that will move the world more
[98:07] towards uh you know, ascendant values.
[98:10] Like if if if I had to sum it up, I'
[98:11] i've got this in my first line here as a
[98:13] takeaway. To build a better world, you
[98:15] need both capital and character. You
[98:18] need both. Like if if you had to pick
[98:20] one, pick character obviously. Um but
[98:24] capital amplifies everything. And that's
[98:27] the whole point of it. Like so you need
[98:29] both. And Bitcoin solves the capital
[98:31] problem. It allows those with character
[98:34] to build and save for the future. They
[98:37] can compound. And that is fundamentally
[98:40] important because if all the people with
[98:42] great character are poor and have no
[98:44] capital, they will easily be overrun by
[98:46] those with with capital and no
[98:48] character. And we have no shortage of
[98:50] those in the modern world.
[98:53] Indeed. Absolutely. Okay. So, um can you
[98:58] uh walk us through a list of your uh
[99:01] virtues? Yes. Mention them, but I guess
[99:04] a list would be helpful.
[99:06] Let me let me go to the section in the
[99:08] book so I can say them in order. Um
[99:10] that'll help people conceptualize a
[99:12] little bit better. Um where is my list?
[99:15] There it is.
[99:17] So virtue number one, justice. Virtue
[99:20] number two, courage. Virtue number three
[99:23] is compassion. I'm reading on the wrong
[99:26] list. Hold on. I'm reading the ch the
[99:28] the ancient Japanese list. God damn it.
[99:32] I
[99:33] um I just want to make sure I got these
[99:35] in order so people know. Okay, so
[99:37] justice, courage, compassion, number
[99:40] four is honor. Number five is honesty
[99:42] and integrity. Um number six is
[99:46] responsibility. Number seven is
[99:48] excellence. Number eight is respect.
[99:51] Number nine is duty and loyalty. And
[99:53] number 10 is restraint and self-control.
[99:56] So they're they're designed to be a
[99:58] constellation uh of virtues each which
[100:02] have some tension uh with respect to
[100:04] another one. And the idea here which is
[100:07] very much like the idea of what the
[100:10] Japanese samurai look to establish was
[100:12] to to have something
[100:15] well-rounded. I think a lot of the
[100:17] mistakes people make is like okay we
[100:19] must be justice and just above all else.
[100:22] Um, it's like, well, yeah, that's good.
[100:23] If you want to create, you know, like a
[100:25]  rigid society where, you know,
[100:27] if someone farts, you kill them, you
[100:29] know, like that's probably not very
[100:30] healthy, right? Like you you need to
[100:32] have that balance with a little bit of
[100:34] compassion. Um, you know, you need uh
[100:37] honor, but if you overdo honor, um
[100:40] people might, you know, go and uh kill
[100:42] themselves or kill their neighbor over
[100:44] the smallest slight. You know, this was
[100:46] a a big thing in ancient Japan or feudal
[100:48] Japan where um honor was such a strong
[100:52] uh virtue that uh the smallest uh
[100:56] transgression from somebody else would
[100:58] end up in a blood feud, right? So like
[101:00] you you have to balance that stuff. So
[101:03] yeah, they're the 10 virtues. And in the
[101:05] book what I do is that there's there's
[101:08] giant chapters on each virtue where the
[101:10] first section of it is I go into the
[101:11] etmology of the word uh into the Latin
[101:14] roots down into the protoindouropean
[101:17] roots and then I also go into the the
[101:19] Japanese kangji the the version of the
[101:21] word in Japanese. So like uh let's say
[101:24] honesty for example is seitsu in
[101:27] Japanese. And I'll go into the the
[101:29] Japanese and Chinese etmology of that.
[101:31] And when you break down the words, like
[101:32] one of the things I found, and I didn't
[101:34] expect this when I was writing the book,
[101:35] was the actual fundamental building
[101:38] blocks of the words mean the same things
[101:41] across cultures that had nothing to do
[101:43] with each other. So the the example that
[101:45] I used before about excellence. Um, in
[101:48] fact, let me I want to pull up the the
[101:50] etmological uh definition of excellence
[101:53] here.
[101:55] Um so in excellence so character
[101:58] excellence mountains these are the
[101:59] symbols of nobility and that which is
[102:01] most good. Why it will make sense in the
[102:03] thing that follows. So the Japanese word
[102:05] which most closely translate to
[102:07] excellence uh or greatness is yushu
[102:09] which is made up of two kji. Um one of
[102:12] them uh conveys the idea of superiority
[102:14] and for what might seem for for what
[102:17] some might seem counterintuitive
[102:18] gentleness. So to be superior does not
[102:20] imply that one is brutish but in fact
[102:23] comes with the inclination and duty to
[102:25] be kind and gentle. Um so that's kind of
[102:28] one part of the kji. Uh then it's
[102:30] composed I'm just kind of like reading
[102:31] through here.
[102:33] Um it is also uh the other component of
[102:37] the kangji suggests a person of
[102:39] outstanding qualities with an undertone
[102:41] of care and consideration. Um and then
[102:44] in the second part of the kanji uh it
[102:47] combines elements meaning um cereal or
[102:50] grain which is an archaic possessive
[102:53] particle meaning soft and clingy. The
[102:54] imagery of the character can be thought
[102:55] of as a grain stalk that stands out for
[102:58] being particularly tall or
[103:00] well-developed symbolizing the idea of
[103:02] being outstanding or exceptional. Um so
[103:05] and it can also be interpreted as the
[103:07] one who possesses the grain which would
[103:09] denote status or nobility. So then when
[103:11] you look at the English one um in
[103:13] English the word excellence comes from
[103:15] the Latin excellentia which means
[103:16] superiority or eminence. It refers to
[103:19] the quality of being outstanding or
[103:20] exceptional at something and the word
[103:23] itself comes from X meaning out from and
[103:28] to rise high or to raise a tower. Um, so
[103:32] looking at all of the etmology when I
[103:34] did the the deep dive on all of these
[103:36] things, there was a relationship between
[103:38] these different languages about what
[103:39] these virtues mean, which you know goes
[103:41] into the idea that, you know, words are
[103:44] deeper than what we think of today. They
[103:47] actually have a a root or a meaning. So
[103:51] long way of answering your question, but
[103:52] that's the 10 virtues. And I go like
[103:55] after the etmology I go into basically
[103:57] examples from history whether it's
[103:59] Alexander the Great or Hopper or Brand
[104:03] or Napoleon or whatever and I use
[104:05] examples of these 10 virtues and how
[104:07] they were embodied and exhibited by the
[104:11] greatest of the great who the way I
[104:13] describe it in the book is who bent the
[104:15] ark of eternity or bent the ark of
[104:17] history uh towards them. That's the
[104:19] that's the conception.
[104:21] Yeah. And I think if you um if if you
[104:24] understand these things as uh I mean if
[104:27] you understand these things deeply as
[104:29] being necessary for the thriving of
[104:32] society, you realize it's no coincidence
[104:35] that they emerge everywhere because the
[104:39] only reason that these people who had
[104:41] these things were able to develop a
[104:44] society that was complex enough for them
[104:45] to sit down and write books and transmit
[104:47] those ideas across generations for us to
[104:49] download them in PDFs today. and uh look
[104:52] at them and find the incredible
[104:55] coincidence of having all of these
[104:58] things reflected across cultures is
[105:01] because these things work for the
[105:04] purpose of making society possible. So
[105:07] whether it's in Japan or in Europe or
[105:09] wherever, people who follow these things
[105:12] and venerate these ideals end up
[105:15] building societies that allow people to
[105:16] sit down and write about those things
[105:18] and transmit that knowledge across time.
[105:20] And so it's I mean it's it's no
[105:23] coincidence. It's why these things work.
[105:25] It's that they allow us to have these
[105:28] functioning societies. And it's the
[105:30] ideal that people have always aspired
[105:32] to. And when they arrive clo or when
[105:35] they, you know, get close to that ideal,
[105:37] then things look good. And when they
[105:40] move away from that ideal, then bad
[105:42] things happen. People start chopping off
[105:45] the dicks.
[105:47] All right. So, I wanted to talk about
[105:49] the Austrian school. So, you mentioned
[105:52] uh Alfred Adler, and that's an Austrian
[105:55] school, but psychology, not in
[105:57] economics. So what is the Austrian
[105:58] school in psychology and as based as the
[106:02] Austrian school in economics? Very much
[106:04] so. So I I mean all three of those uh
[106:08] Jung Freud and Adler were contemporaries
[106:11] and they were all uh differing Austrian
[106:13] schools and it was incredible. It was
[106:15] like this was the golden age of uh
[106:16] civilization right where these great
[106:18] thinkers came to be. But Alfred Adler
[106:22] specifically is the forgotten uh father
[106:24] of psychology. And I I I've been
[106:28] following Adler's work for quite a
[106:30] while. I've always been, you know, for
[106:32] the last 15 years I've been pissing off
[106:33] all of my friends and family and
[106:35] everything by telling them that
[106:36] depression is a is a scam basically. And
[106:40] depression is not something you have,
[106:42] but it's something you do. um you know
[106:44] in order to do depression you need to be
[106:47] selfish you need to be weak you need to
[106:49] be um you need to eat garbage exactly
[106:52] all this sort of stuff right so it's
[106:53] like depression is a thing you do it's
[106:55] not a thing you have and Adler's work
[106:58] kind of spoke about a lot of this so so
[107:00] Adler did away with the concept of
[107:02] trauma for example you know his idea was
[107:04] that look it's not that you've had a
[107:06] trauma that
[107:08] uh uh predisposes you to act in a
[107:12] particular way you act in a particular
[107:13] way and then you justify it with your
[107:15] trauma, right? Like so he he flipped
[107:17] things uh on its head. And his whole uh
[107:22] philosophy around psychology is that you
[107:25] are the actor. You are the agent and
[107:29] what happens to you, you take in, you
[107:32] apply a meaning to it and then you
[107:34] choose what to do with it in accordance
[107:37] with that which you believe. And if you
[107:39] believe you are a traumatized person,
[107:40] then you will act in accordance with
[107:42] that and you will behave in that way.
[107:44] And it, you know, it funny enough, it
[107:46] does away with therapy. It does away
[107:48] with drugs and SSRIs and all this sort
[107:50] of stuff because it is completely
[107:51] incompatible with that model of
[107:53] psychology that is taught in the world
[107:55] today where you're a victim and, you
[107:57] know, we're going to give you 6,000
[107:58] labels. You know, now you're depressed,
[108:00] now you're anxious, now you're this, now
[108:01] you're that. I like his school of
[108:05] psychology does away with all of that
[108:07] sort of stuff. And it's it's really
[108:08] rough. I I do a whole uh section in the
[108:10] book specifically. I call it the uh the
[108:13] psychology of
[108:15] responsibility. And
[108:17] um and it's going to I know when people
[108:21] read this, it's going to uh make make
[108:23] them angry. Um I've I've got a section
[108:25] here. So it says Adler infamously didn't
[108:28] believe in trauma which triggered his
[108:30] contemporaries and especially modern
[108:31] psychologists. He didn't deny the
[108:33] existence of traumatic events of course
[108:35] nor the mental and emotional scars they
[108:36] leave. But he emphasized that people
[108:38] have the capacity to choose and direct
[108:40] their behavior and therefore their
[108:41] reaction to such events. Yes, you may be
[108:44] traumatized, but that's not the end of
[108:45] the story. Instead of placing yourself
[108:47] at the effect of trauma powerless
[108:48] against it, you have the agency to deal
[108:51] with it. Um, and you know, funny enough,
[108:54] the world we live in um is completely uh
[108:57] like ignores his whole form of thinking.
[109:00] The next paragraph says, "His work is
[109:02] largely glossed over in modern
[109:04] psychology, most likely because it
[109:05] negates the need for ongoing therapy,
[109:07] medication, and the neverending labeling
[109:10] of every emotion as a syndrome or
[109:11] disorder. Not unlike how the Austrian
[109:14] school of economy economics, which does
[109:15] away with the bureaucratic central
[109:16] banking apparatus, is conveniently
[109:19] ignored. Coincidentally, Adler 2 was
[109:21] Austrian. There was clearly something
[109:23] about that region and error."
[109:25] Yeah, I I I agree. I think I I would say
[109:29] maybe preworld war I Vienna may have
[109:32] been the pinnacle of human civilization.
[109:34] I think you look at the kind of
[109:36] scholarship and the culture that was
[109:37] emerging at that point. There's a case
[109:40] to be made that it may have been there.
[109:41] And yeah, I um I very much agree with
[109:44] this analysis and I've um I I' I've
[109:46] tweeted a few times about how much I
[109:48] think psychiatry is a scam and just a
[109:51] scam. I think it's a criminal enterprise
[109:53] and this is probably going to piss off
[109:54] some of my listeners. Um but I truly
[109:57] think it is and I think also um you know
[110:00] psychology as well um getting people to
[110:02] sit on couches and talk on things um I
[110:05] think it's it's hugely destructive. I've
[110:07] seen so many people whose lives are
[110:09] destroyed by therapy because the
[110:13] business model here is that you need the
[110:14] guy to come back to your couch. If your
[110:17] business model is you make money from
[110:19] people sitting on your couch and opening
[110:20] up, you need them to come back. So the
[110:22] priority is how to make them come back.
[110:25] And then of course with SRSRIS is just
[110:27] downright criminal. You give people
[110:29] drugs that are completely completely um
[110:32] truly criminal. I mean they they people
[110:35] don't really understand what these drugs
[110:36] do. They put them through the corrupt
[110:38] FDA process and they just get people to
[110:41] become dependent on them. And of course
[110:43] the best argument for those drugs that
[110:45] people will give is oh
[110:47] no if people quit them then very bad
[110:50] things happen. Exactly. Which is why
[110:52] they shouldn't be on them in the first
[110:53] place. But I think the u you're
[110:55] absolutely correct in that the business
[110:58] of psychology and psychiatry is a
[111:01] business and in fiat world business you
[111:03] know people don't have savings. So
[111:05] business needs recurring revenue. So all
[111:07] the business models switch toward how do
[111:09] we get recurring revenue because you
[111:11] can't just you know cure some people and
[111:13] make money and then keep the money and
[111:14] save it and stay financially independent
[111:17] because you have enough money. The money
[111:18] is constantly losing value. So, you have
[111:20] to constantly be finding new clients or
[111:23] getting returned clients. And so, this,
[111:27] you know, the it's kind of like dating
[111:29] apps. I I saw this metaphor sometime on
[111:31] Twitter. You know, dating apps, they
[111:33] want it to be good enough for you to
[111:34] meet people, but they don't want it to
[111:35] be good enough for you to meet the
[111:37] person that you actually spend the rest
[111:39] of your life with because then you're no
[111:40] longer in the dating app. And it's the
[111:42] same thing with psychiatry and
[111:43] psychology. And I think the really
[111:44] pernicious thing about it is especially
[111:46] with this idea of trauma is
[111:49] um people who go to psychology and
[111:51] psychiatry don't go there. Well, not
[111:53] always obviously and I'm not
[111:54] generalizing. I'm sure you know I'm sure
[111:58] everybody listening um you know your
[112:00] psychiatrist and your psychologist I'm
[112:01] sure is the exception and obviously
[112:03] don't listen to me. I'm crazy and I
[112:05] don't have any medical degrees. But you
[112:08] know I'm going to keep ranting anyway.
[112:10] Um you know the the the the
[112:14] um the the people who go to
[112:16] psychiatrists and psychologists they
[112:18] don't go there to go to get over their
[112:21] trauma. They go there so that their
[112:23] trauma defines them. The trauma becomes
[112:25] legitimiz their life. Exactly. It
[112:28] becomes I am doing terrible things to
[112:30] myself because I was traumatized. And
[112:33] the answer is not for me to stop doing
[112:35] terrible things. The answer is for me to
[112:37] sit down on a couch and talk to somebody
[112:38] about how much I'm traumatized so that
[112:42] justify to myself this horrific patterns
[112:44] of behavior. I've seen this with several
[112:46] people and it's it's quite remarkable
[112:48] that the it's it's it's liberating you
[112:51] from the agency of taking charge of your
[112:54] life. And you see it in in in very clear
[112:56] destructive behavior. And some of these
[112:58] people, you know, they do drugs or they
[113:00] are alcoholics and you tell them, you
[113:03] know, okay, you're drinking too much.
[113:05] Maybe you had too much to drink. Maybe
[113:06] you should lay off the drinks for now.
[113:08] And they immediately, it's like
[113:10] conditioning. It's like, you know, the
[113:11] Pavlovian dog immediately once you
[113:14] mention their the thing that they're
[113:16] doing that is destroying their life,
[113:17] which is alcohol or drugs. And tell
[113:19] them, "Hey, maybe you should lay off
[113:20] this stuff. Maybe you've had enough
[113:21] drinks for today, this immediately they
[113:25] bring up the trauma like you don't
[113:27] understand. You don't know what I'm
[113:28] going through. You don't know what I've
[113:29] been through. My dad, my mom." Exactly.
[113:32] And and and it's always it's it's it's
[113:35] it's always I've seen it as just very
[113:39] evil because they go to those
[113:40] psychologists and psychiatrists and
[113:43] they're told, "Yes, have a here you go.
[113:45] You've got another 50 minutes. Sit down
[113:48] and dwell on it. Stew it. Rethink it.
[113:52] Relive it. Let it define you. Let it
[113:55] define who you are. Keep living it over
[113:57] and over and over and over again. And
[113:59] never break away from it. and keep
[114:01] letting the impact of it linger on. The
[114:05] trauma, the bad things that happened to
[114:07] you, let them continue to define you.
[114:09] You are what happened to you. And that's
[114:12] why you need to keep doing whatever it
[114:14] is that you're doing. And nobody should
[114:16] get the right to tell you. And and you
[114:18] know a big part of this of course is
[114:19] with psychology and psychiatry is if
[114:21] there's any positive influence anybody's
[114:23] trying to actually have a good influence
[114:24] on you and tell you you know what maybe
[114:26] you should just stop drinking instead of
[114:28] keep continuing to wallow in this and
[114:31] drinking here is just a simple example
[114:32] usually the patterns of behavior that
[114:34] develop from this are more complex and
[114:36] destructive well you know I mean
[114:38] drinking is pretty destructive it can be
[114:40] but in any case if somebody's trying to
[114:42] break you out of this you de the the
[114:45] psych the psychiatrist and the
[114:47] Psychologists are likely to make you
[114:49] develop walls to defend yourself from
[114:51] this. No, no, this person's being toxic.
[114:53] You don't want to be you you you don't
[114:56] need more pressure on you. You've
[114:58] already gone through the trauma and that
[115:00] was horrible enough. You don't need
[115:02] people to push you to stop doing the
[115:04] destructive thing that you're doing. You
[115:06] need people to indulge you. Come and sit
[115:07] on my couch and be validated about all
[115:11] of your feelings and about all of the
[115:12] things that you're doing. and come and
[115:14] sit on my couch and take the pill. You
[115:16] know, lifetime subscription to farmer
[115:18] poison. It's I I I I want to say that
[115:22] like
[115:25] you know when you when you say the the
[115:27] best thing here for people to do is to
[115:30] stop and not uh you know legitimize
[115:32] their issues and all this sort of stuff.
[115:33] And like this ties back into the virtues
[115:35] again is cuz what does it take to
[115:37] actually stop? Like if you've got ex
[115:39] problem and you're blaming it on your
[115:40] trauma, like what it really takes to
[115:42] stop is one word or one virtue which is
[115:45] courage. Like it takes courage to rise
[115:48] above whatever it is your trauma,
[115:50] whatever it is, the environment,
[115:52] whatever it is that happened to you in
[115:53] order to fix your life. And that's
[115:56] Adler's focus like you know when people
[115:58] asked him and it's in his books he talks
[116:00] he goes the fundamental thing that
[116:02] people need to overcome their
[116:03] psychological problems he boils it down
[116:05] to courage. That's it. you need, you
[116:07] have to have the courage to to go beyond
[116:11] what your perceived limitation is. And
[116:13] this is, I think, why, you know, it
[116:15] wasn't so much a conspiracy that Alfred
[116:18] Adler's um work was ignored. I think
[116:20] maybe it's become a conspiracy, but his
[116:23] work fundamentally was uncomfortable.
[116:24] It's uncomfortable to be courageous.
[116:27] It's very comfortable to sit down and
[116:29] somebody tell you, look, it's not your
[116:30] fault. You know, it's this label and
[116:33] it's this, you know, the thing that
[116:34] happened to you. It's your mom's fault,
[116:36] it's your dad's fault, it's your
[116:37] grandfather's fault, it's the
[116:38] workplace's fault, it's somebody else's
[116:39] fault. And in the process of doing that,
[116:41] like I think much to what you said
[116:43] earlier about um when we when we started
[116:46] the conversation about how the world has
[116:47] devolved, it's like these things don't
[116:49] necessarily have to be some grand
[116:50] conspiracy where it's like, okay, we
[116:52] must not do this. They kind of happen to
[116:54] themselves when you have an environment
[116:56] or, you know, there's certain like uh uh
[116:59] incentives, right? You you want to
[117:00] follow the incentives where they go and
[117:02] this is uh what happens. And um I I want
[117:06] to read something here from from the
[117:07] book which it says you know the whole
[117:09] point of uh Adler's school of psychology
[117:11] is that it's
[117:13] teological meaning that it is concerned
[117:15] with the present and the future which
[117:17] are the things surprisingly that you can
[117:20] have control or influence over. Contrast
[117:22] this with essentially all other modern
[117:24] schools of psychology which are
[117:26] eeteological. In other words, they focus
[117:28] on past events and biological factors
[117:31] that impact psychology. that is the
[117:33] things you have very little influence
[117:35] over. One is goal oriented, the other is
[117:37] causation oriented. And that right there
[117:39] kind of comes back to being an agent um
[117:42] or being a victim, right? Like modern
[117:44] psychology just literally to to make you
[117:47] feel better and to validate all of your
[117:49] issues gives you a whole set of labels
[117:52] and you know you then have I have OCD,
[117:55] oh, I have anxiety. Oh, I have
[117:57] depression. Oh, I have this. I have
[117:59] that. you you have a a label and a
[118:01] reason for every single one of the
[118:02] problems in your life when the solution
[118:04] to all of
[118:06] it is eat some steak, go to the gym and
[118:09] get some sun, right? Like is some
[118:11] courage. And we used to like men and
[118:13] women used to deal with this through
[118:14] like men went to work or went to war,
[118:16] right? Women used to raise families and
[118:19] now we've got all this other in the way
[118:21] with all of these layers of labeling and
[118:24] SSRIs and drugs and therapy and all this
[118:27] kind of crap which obfuscates all of it.
[118:30] Yeah, absolutely. And I think one very
[118:32] dangerous aspect of this which I've um
[118:34] it's it's a very powerful point that
[118:36] I've come across, you know, in in modern
[118:38] society everybody's got to have um well
[118:42] I mean the highest status that you can
[118:44] aspire to is victimhood. Yes. Yes. uh
[118:47] you have the oppression Olympics. Yeah,
[118:50] the oppression Olympics. And so
[118:51] basically your status in society is
[118:53] determined by how many um tags of
[118:56] oppression you've got. So uh being
[118:59] black, being brown, all that these are
[119:01] all great points. Being um a woman,
[119:04] being gay, and you know, not everybody
[119:07] can be black or brown or a woman. So
[119:10] then you've got to be creative. And this
[119:15] has I think particularly in universities
[119:18] and it's ob obviously it's big pharma
[119:20] marketing for their poison. But the uh
[119:25] this this is this is how you can get in
[119:27] on the Olympics particularly if you
[119:28] don't fit into the other categories. If
[119:31] you're if you're a white male
[119:34] I mean or even a white woman because you
[119:36] know woman is not such a big deal
[119:38] anymore. You're not really very high on
[119:39] the oppression Olympics if you're a
[119:42] woman anymore. But if you have a
[119:46] depression, if you have a condition and
[119:48] then you define yourself by that
[119:50] condition, people wear it like a an
[119:53] identity instead of taking pride in
[119:55] their work and their achievement. You
[119:57] know, this it's hey, I have this thing
[119:59] and so therefore when you talk to me,
[120:00] you have to talk to me in a certain way
[120:01] and you have to deal with me in a
[120:03] certain way. And again, this is this is
[120:06] just again I keep drawing everything
[120:09] back to fiat. You know, I don't think so
[120:12] much it's a conspiracy against Adler.
[120:15] It's just that Adler doesn't pay bills
[120:17] in a fiat world. In a fiat world, you
[120:19] need recurring revenue because nobody
[120:20] has savings. And so all the ideas that
[120:23] lead to recurring revenue work. If you
[120:26] actually did find a magic pill that
[120:28] cures cancer, you would not be able to
[120:30] market it. you'd need to pay so many
[120:32] billions of dollars to get it into um
[120:36] the market to be approved to get FDA
[120:38] approval and to get licensing and
[120:40] patents and all of those things. That
[120:41] costs several billions of dollars and it
[120:43] takes a lot of time. And then if people
[120:45] will just take one pill and be cured,
[120:47] that's likely not going to be paying for
[120:50] you. So you need to make addictions. So
[120:53] the pills need to be for addiction. And
[120:55] so telling people, you know, as Adler
[120:57] says, look, your trauma happened, but
[121:00] you're alive now and you're able to
[121:03] function as a normal human being
[121:05] physically. So you can just go out there
[121:07] and live your life. You can just live
[121:08] your life and not let the trauma define
[121:10] you. Just go to the gym, eat some meat,
[121:13] and get some sunshine for 3 months and
[121:15] see how it goes. If you do that, that's
[121:18] going to really destroy the business
[121:20] model of psychology and psychiatry. And
[121:23] so you gota you got to stew in your
[121:26] trauma, man. You have to sit there and
[121:28] and and just stew in it and let it
[121:30] define you and continue to let it define
[121:32] you. And you know, I mean, I I remember
[121:34] one of the one of the reasons I respect
[121:36] Andrew Tate is because he was really
[121:39] brave about doing this. I've thought
[121:42] this and I generally not wanted to speak
[121:44] too much about it because I think it can
[121:46] be um quite uncomfortable for people,
[121:49] but I'm just putting this out there
[121:50] right now. If you disagree with me, you
[121:53] know what? I don't care. Don't come
[121:55] ranting at me. Yes, I know a lot of
[121:57] people disagree. I don't care. Um, I've
[122:00] heard a lot of people, you've spent all
[122:02] of your life being told that Freud and
[122:04] um, psychiatry and psychology are
[122:07] important. I think it's stupid
[122:09] pseudocience. And don't shout at me if
[122:12] you don't agree. That's fine. There are
[122:14] other people out there who say the
[122:16] things that you like. Just go listen to
[122:17] them. Um, this is my opinion. I think
[122:20] you're better off just eating meat,
[122:23] lifting, and getting
[122:25] sunshine. But I'm sure you know your
[122:27] doctor and your psychologist and
[122:29] psychiatrist disagree for very good
[122:30] reasons. So, whatever. Yeah. Look, the
[122:33] last thing I'll say on this is, you
[122:35] know, depression
[122:38] is real in so far as it's a temporary
[122:42] state that acts as a signal. your your
[122:45] body's nervous system is telling you
[122:47] that you are not living in accordance
[122:50] with uh your ideals, your values or you
[122:53] you're living without meaning. That's
[122:56] it. And if you go and numb your body's
[122:58] signaling mechanism, you are going to
[123:02] everything up. And that's the biggest
[123:04] criminal sort of component about
[123:06] depression. This is why I've always
[123:07] hated this idea is that you like, sorry,
[123:11] I'm going to have to read another part
[123:12] of the book here. It says, "For over 15
[123:15] years, I've triggered my psychologist
[123:16] friends by calling depression an act or
[123:18] behavior, not a syndrome or disease. You
[123:20] don't get depression, you do depression
[123:21] by choosing to remain in that state.
[123:23] It's not just something that happens to
[123:25] you or that you catch like the flu. It's
[123:27] a choice or at most it's a temporary
[123:29] feeling. Of course, life can knock you
[123:32] down and instead of feeling ev elevated,
[123:34] you occasionally feel depressed. That's
[123:37] normal. It happens to all of us and it's
[123:39] your body's way of telling you to take
[123:41] stock and introspect for a minute. This
[123:43] feeling is a healthy signal from the
[123:45] nervous system to adjust your behavior
[123:47] or a warning that you are lacking focus
[123:49] or meaning in your life. Instead of
[123:51] using it as the catalyst for change or
[123:54] writing it like the wave of emotion that
[123:56] it is, modern psychology shortcircuits
[123:58] the natural process by teaching you to
[124:00] numb yourself into oblivion with drugs
[124:02] or to marry the feeling and label
[124:05] yourself clinically depressed. Right? So
[124:07] that's like this is a big point for me
[124:09] and it I I I want to I want to just say
[124:12] something earlier. you said like
[124:13] recurring revenue and you know is is you
[124:16] know something that fiat incentivizes
[124:17] and and I I guess I only agree 50%
[124:19] there. I think recurring revenue is
[124:21] always a a a something that a business
[124:24] will optimize for. You want to increase
[124:25] your customer lifetime value and it's
[124:27] always easier to get another purchase
[124:29] from an existing customer than it is to
[124:31] go and chase a new customer. I think in
[124:33] cases like this when it comes to the
[124:36] criminality around uh you know turning
[124:39] people into victims and telling them to
[124:42] wear 10,000 labels about their
[124:44] depression or everything like that. I
[124:45] think this is where
[124:48] ultimately teaching the virtue of
[124:50] responsibility comes into play. like we
[124:54] can't. So this is an area where we we
[124:57] have to it's not just about fixing the
[124:59] money but it's about fixing the virtues
[125:01] or fixing the culture. Right? If you if
[125:04] you have a culture that values
[125:06] responsibility or that holds
[125:08] responsibility up is a virtue that you
[125:09] like do you think for for example
[125:12] responsibility was huge amongst the
[125:14] Spartans. Do you think the Spartans had
[125:16] a psychologist there sitting there
[125:18] telling them about oh their depression
[125:20] all this? No, that didn't happen, right?
[125:22] Like or the samurai like could you
[125:24] imagine the samurai as a warrior class
[125:27] worrying about like oh you know I'm
[125:29] feeling a bit depressed today and you
[125:31] know taking some pills. It it did not
[125:33] work like that. So when you establish a
[125:35] culture which basically has a standard
[125:38] that hey we don't accept victimhood
[125:41] amongst our young men or or whatever
[125:43] that case is like you have those
[125:44] standards then you you can basically
[125:49] ostracize in many ways
[125:51] or not allow for the creation of these
[125:55] kind of corrupt businesses like big
[125:57] farmer that want to create a society in
[126:01] which everybody's a victim because the
[126:03] more victims you have the more customers
[126:04] you have. So, so this is where it sort
[126:05] of comes back to my whole theory and the
[126:08] the whole reason I wrote this book. We
[126:10] need Bitcoin, but we need this code as
[126:13] well that they both have to come hand in
[126:15] hand to build civilization. They're so
[126:18] important uh together.
[126:20] Yeah. No, I I definitely agree with
[126:22] that. And I think um yeah, as you said,
[126:26] you know, the samurai weren't getting
[126:27] depressed. Anybody who's got meaning, a
[126:29] reason to get out of bed is not being
[126:31] depressed. If you get out of bed excited
[126:33] because you want to do things today,
[126:36] then you are going to not have a problem
[126:39] with depression. I think this is just um
[126:42] just the nature of things. And and as
[126:43] you said, it's your body is giving you a
[126:47] very valuable signal that what you're
[126:48] doing now is not working. It could be
[126:50] the relationships that you're in. It
[126:52] could be the work that you're doing. It
[126:54] could be something about whatever it is.
[126:56] There's something about your life that
[126:57] is eating you inside and your body is
[126:59] signaling this. And if you go to the
[127:02] scammer psychiatrist and he just gives
[127:04] you a pill, but you continue to do your
[127:06] life the way that you're doing it, it's
[127:09] actually far worse than just being a
[127:11] poisonous addiction that's going to uh
[127:13] cost you a lot of money. It's a lot
[127:16] worse because it's allowing you to
[127:18] perpetuate and continue the behavior
[127:20] that is causing this. And it does that
[127:23] by numbing you. And it numbs you and
[127:24] that makes you a very, very different
[127:26] person. Which is why, you
[127:28] know, I think uh I think you know if if
[127:33] you lift if you eat meat and if you get
[127:36] enough sunshine I am pretty sure you can
[127:38] begin to fix the depression. Now
[127:41] obviously that's not enough because if
[127:42] you're say miserable about the
[127:44] relationship that you're doing,
[127:46] miserable about your work or miserable
[127:47] about the day you're spending your life
[127:49] that you need to fix that. But the way
[127:52] to fix that is to get out there and
[127:54] become healthier so that your brain
[127:56] starts working better. So get sunshine,
[127:58] eat meat and and exercise. Work your
[128:03] body, healthy body, healthy mind. You're
[128:06] going to look better, you're going to
[128:06] feel better, you're going to function
[128:09] better, think better. And all of that
[128:11] combined is going to allow you a lot
[128:13] more room for solving your problems. And
[128:16] you'll figure out a solution a lot
[128:18] better when you're high on stake. and
[128:21] sun and steel rather than if you're high
[128:24] on SSRIs and all of this pharma poison.
[128:28] And I'll just say this, you are a lot I
[128:32] mean just try the try one month of beef
[128:36] of steak and steel the 3 S's before you
[128:39] switch to the SSRI because you know what
[128:42] it's very easy to quit steak and steel.
[128:44] So if it doesn't work you try a month.
[128:46] Okay, you maybe maybe I don't believe
[128:50] this is going to happen, but maybe it
[128:51] makes you feel a lot worse. Maybe the
[128:54] sun is not for you. Maybe beef is not
[128:55] for you. Maybe you really are so special
[128:57] that you are um not like all the rest of
[129:00] us humans who can thrive on physical
[129:03] exercise and meat and sunshine. But
[129:06] guess what? If that happens, you can
[129:08] quit meat and sunshine and gym any day
[129:13] and there are no bad withdrawal effects.
[129:16] but you sign up for your psychiatrist's
[129:18] pills, it's it's a lot more difficult to
[129:21] quit. So, I very very strongly urge you
[129:24] to maybe consider trying the first one
[129:26] first. But hey, this is not medical
[129:28] advice. I'm just uh you know, crazy
[129:30] conspiracy theorist uh economist who's
[129:34] just ranting with my friend and uh you
[129:37] chose to listen to this. So, don't hold
[129:40] me responsible if you um you know, if if
[129:42] you eat steak and it causes your
[129:44] depression to not go away, then um don't
[129:46] sue me. Our condolences. You only act
[129:49] out of your own will. I'm just ranting
[129:51] here. You don't have to listen to me.
[129:52] None of this is medical advice. I want
[129:55] to I want to tie this into one other
[129:58] section of the book called
[129:59] physiocsychology, which is a very
[130:01] nichian uh idea. And while I was writing
[130:04] the book, I really went down the niche
[130:05] rabbit hole. And and I think this is why
[130:07] I love this idea of like merging uh sort
[130:10] of Christianity, hobbyism and nichianism
[130:13] kind of together like this ven diagram
[130:14] as a framework for individuals and
[130:16] society. But before I go down there, I
[130:18] just wanted to say I I just came up with
[130:20] something as you were talking. So
[130:21] obviously we know the sun's steel and
[130:22] stake and I think that is the foundation
[130:25] that you need and then if you want to
[130:27] keep going you need purpose progress and
[130:30] power like that's the sort of the three
[130:32] next thing is you need to have something
[130:34] you're working towards you need to be
[130:36] making progress like you know I I I
[130:39] wrote about this the other day talking
[130:41] about how freedom and happiness are
[130:43] effects of responsibility and progress
[130:46] right and we have optimized for the like
[130:48] society has optimized for the effects
[130:50] not for the things that make them
[130:51] happen. Right? So progress is the only
[130:53] way to get happiness. You cannot be
[130:55] happy if you're not making progress in
[130:56] some way, shape or form. So you need
[130:57] purpose, you need progress. And the
[131:00] Nietian idea of you need to be expanding
[131:02] in some way, shape or form your power.
[131:04] And you know, power is a dirty word.
[131:06] Like people think, oh, you know, power
[131:08] is what corrupts and all this sort of
[131:09]  Total like power is just simply
[131:12] your capacity to channel energy. Power
[131:15] like in the physics sense is energy over
[131:18] time, right? There's nothing evil about
[131:19] that. And your goal as a human being is
[131:23] to enhance or to increase the amount of
[131:26] energy you can channel at least till you
[131:28] get to your peak, you know, and then in
[131:29] life as you sort of get older or
[131:31] whatever the case is. If you can't
[131:33] channel physical power as much, you want
[131:34] to figure out how to channel the power
[131:36] through maybe your children or through
[131:38] the other things that you're doing. But
[131:39] fundamentally like life is about
[131:41] channeling energy. So sun, steel, stake
[131:43] is your foundation. purpose, progress,
[131:46] power is sort of like the the the
[131:48] direction you want to go. But um but but
[131:51] I'll just say that um yeah, definitely
[131:53] you need to go to you need to seek those
[131:56] things. But I think sunset steel and
[131:57] stake is how you're going to have the
[131:59] mental and physical clarity. Exactly.
[132:01] It's the foundation. Yeah. You you can't
[132:02] do it without those. So So you need the
[132:04] foundation and then you need to then
[132:06] that's your the direction. But you you
[132:08] can't do that without fuel in the tank.
[132:10] But um something I wanted to say about
[132:13] physiocys. So I I I talk a lot in the
[132:17] book about moving back to the body and
[132:19] and this is related here is like sun
[132:21] steel stake is the solution to
[132:24] psychology. Sorry it's the it's the
[132:26] solution to depression because it
[132:28] strengthens your body if you ignore if
[132:31] you pretend like your body doesn't
[132:33] exist. Like you know this is what all
[132:34] the AI nerds and all this sort of stuff
[132:36] like all the morons think is like
[132:38] somehow the mind is in the brain. Well
[132:41] it's not. the the mind exists within the
[132:44] body and the brain simultaneously. You
[132:46] can't have a brain and a vat. Like Yuval
[132:48] Harrari is if he thinks that
[132:50] we're going to live forever with a brain
[132:52] and a vat, right? It doesn't work like
[132:53] that. You need the body and the mind.
[132:55] They need to come together. And as you
[132:57] cultivate one, you cultivate the other.
[132:59] As you ignore one, you ignore the other,
[133:01] basically.
[133:02] And it it reminds me of this idea that
[133:06] philosophy
[133:08] precratic ancient Greek philosophy there
[133:11] was no concept of philosophy that was
[133:13] cerebral. It wasn't about talking about
[133:15] ideas. philosophy was I went and I
[133:18] sailed the Mediterranean during these
[133:21] storms and I went and conquered an
[133:23] island and I I I exerted my philosophy,
[133:27] my way of life, my my understanding and
[133:29] I came back with some lessons and I told
[133:31] a story that was the original
[133:32] incarnation of what philosophy was.
[133:35] We've sort of like turned it into a
[133:37] cerebralization these days, you know,
[133:39] pontificating about ideas and, you know,
[133:40] arguing about like the the definition.
[133:43] You know, I had a debate with Breedlove
[133:45] the other day about like the semantics
[133:46] of the word freedom. And I was like, for
[133:48]  sake, like this is just like
[133:52] painful. I get that freedom is important
[133:54] to you, but for sake, like I don't need
[133:56] a philosophical treatise on like the the
[133:59] ineffable, you know, existence of
[134:01] freedom. Like I get it. So I think it's
[134:05] you know one one of the the takeaways of
[134:07] the book here that I want to mention to
[134:08] people is
[134:10] that you cannot ignore the body like the
[134:13] idea of um you know brain detached from
[134:17] body is a a a yval harari wet dream it's
[134:21] a nerd's fallacy like you need both you
[134:24] need to cultivate both and true wisdom
[134:26] or true mastery there's a section in the
[134:28] book or a whole chapter on mastery
[134:30] mastery is when the knowledge moves from
[134:33] the brain into the body, right? When
[134:36] when you truly know that you know
[134:38] something like this is the the best
[134:40] football players, the best racing car
[134:42] drivers, the best athletes, the best
[134:45] thinkers, the best anything have body
[134:48] intelligence where the knowledge or the
[134:50] capacity of it has moved into their
[134:53] reflexes. That's true mastery. That's
[134:55] through knowledge. And that's what you
[134:57] know, that's what requires the 10,000
[134:59] hours of practice, right? you you
[135:02] practice something to know it in your
[135:04] blood, in your DNA, not in your brain.
[135:07] Um, which goes back to what we just
[135:10] discussed, Sun, steel, stake, purpose,
[135:12] like all of this stuff is it's all
[135:13] interrelated. The these principles apply
[135:16] across the whole spectrum.
[135:18] Yeah. Um, well, you mentioned NE. I
[135:21] don't know if we've seen this. I've
[135:22] tweeted this out before. I really love
[135:24] this passage from Mises, which is
[135:26] basically him telling Nze, "Do you even
[135:29] lift, bro?" And it's it's really
[135:32] hilarious. I think it was one of the
[135:34] best dunks on Nichze. Uh so I'm going to
[135:37] mention it. I mean it's um it uh I mean
[135:40] look I agree with you on the importance
[135:42] of this but I think a lot of these
[135:45] people can uh can sort of take niche in
[135:48] a way that uh mises critiques very well.
[135:51] So yes, it's true. You know, you want um
[135:54] there is a nobility to doing things with
[135:56] your body and you know the the idea that
[135:59] might is right and that you want to be
[136:02] living dangerously. I mean, it sounds
[136:05] tempting and it's very tempting for him
[136:08] to be saying it. But in
[136:10] reality, this notion of living as a
[136:12] violent person is not powerful at all.
[136:16] Because the strongest man in the world,
[136:19] you know, think about the most violent
[136:21] person, think about Jon Jones or Francis
[136:23] Nanu, the toughest UFC fighter, he'd
[136:27] probably kill
[136:29] 99.999% of men with his bare hands.
[136:32] Maybe even more. He could kill them with
[136:34] his bare hands if you put him in a cage.
[136:36] Well, that guy, a 10-year-old girl can
[136:39] kill him if she is able to be part of
[136:42] human civilization, part of the division
[136:44] of labor, and he's not. So, if you're
[136:47] Jon Jones, a 10-year-old and and you're
[136:49] just relying on the fact that you're
[136:51] powerful, so you don't need people. So,
[136:52] you don't trade with people. You don't
[136:53] respect people's property. You just you
[136:56] think, "Well, I'm stronger than all of
[136:57] those people." Think of Jon Jones
[136:59] decides, I'm stronger than everybody.
[137:00] I'm just going to stop paying for
[137:02] anything. I'm just going to take all of
[137:04] my stuff that I want because then if
[137:06] anybody talks to me, I'm just going to
[137:07] punch them. Well, no matter how strong
[137:09] you are physically, you are
[137:12] inconsequential and an inconsequential
[137:14] fly, a mosquito next to anybody who has
[137:18] access to the division of labor because
[137:20] the division of labor allows us to build
[137:21] guns that can shoot you down. Whereas
[137:23] Jon Jones on his own, no matter how
[137:25] smart, no matter how strong, will never
[137:26] be able to build a gun on his own.
[137:28] Nobody can build a gun on his own. Gun
[137:30] requires an enormous division of labor.
[137:32] So yes, you want to get out there, you
[137:35] want to work out, you do want to lift,
[137:37] but you don't want to glorify violence
[137:40] and barbarism because by your own
[137:43] measure, which is strength and
[137:46] uh and and power, this is not the way to
[137:50] be powerful. The way to be powerful is
[137:51] to join the division of labor, respect
[137:53] property rights, not violate people's
[137:54] rights, and understand that property
[137:58] rights are more important than might.
[138:01] And so right is Trump's might. If this
[138:04] is your land, it doesn't matter if I can
[138:06] punch you and take your land because if
[138:08] I take your land and punch you, then you
[138:10] know your son or daughter can just get a
[138:13] gun and shoot me. And so that's why, you
[138:16] know, the the the strongest societies,
[138:19] the strongest people in the world are
[138:20] all part of the division of labor. So
[138:23] Mises says to Nze, "It is noteworthy
[138:26] that the men who were foremost in
[138:28] extolling the eminence of the savage
[138:30] impulses of our barbarian forefathers
[138:33] were so frail that their bodies would
[138:35] not have come up to the requirements of
[138:37] dangerous living. Nie, even before his
[138:40] mental breakdown, was so sickly that the
[138:42] only climate he could stand was that of
[138:44] the Enadin Valley and of some Italian
[138:47] districts. He would not have been in a
[138:49] position to accomplish his work if
[138:50] civilized society had not protected his
[138:53] delicate nerves against the roughness of
[138:55] life. The apostles of violence wrote
[138:58] their books under the sheltering roof of
[139:00] bourgeoa security which they derided and
[139:03] disparaged. They were free to publish
[139:05] their incendiary ceremonies because the
[139:07] liberalism which they scorned
[139:10] safeguarded freedom of the press. They
[139:12] would have been desperate if they had
[139:13] had to forego the blessing. those sorry
[139:18] they would have been desperate if they
[139:19] had had to forgo the blessings of the
[139:20] civilization and scorned by of the
[139:23] civilization scorned by their philosophy
[139:26] and what a spectacle was that what a
[139:28] spectacle was that timid writer George
[139:30] Sorell who went so far in his praise of
[139:32] brutality as to blame the modern system
[139:34] of education for weakening men's inborn
[139:36] tendencies towards violence. I I just
[139:39] couldn't help every time I'd see Yeah. I
[139:41] mean Yeah. I mean I mean to you know
[139:45] nature would hike six hours uh each day.
[139:48] Um he he would wake up at 5:00 in the
[139:50] morning. He would have some fruit and
[139:52] then he would hike for 6 hours in the
[139:53] mountains and then he would go and
[139:54] write. There was nothing weak about
[139:56] that. I think a lot of people sort of
[139:58] had he should have been having steak and
[139:59] lifting but okay. I mean you know
[140:01] whatever. Yeah. I'm pretty sure he was
[140:03] eating steak as well. Like you know this
[140:05] this guy was in the army initially. He
[140:08] uh he was uh like literally shot at and
[140:13] um you know went to war with people. So
[140:15] like this sort of conception that nature
[140:17] was like a and all this sort of
[140:18] stuff is incorrect. He may have you know
[140:20] become an incel but you know people say
[140:21] then he got syphilis and you know the
[140:23] only way to get syphilis is by someone.
[140:25] So that kind of you know contradiction
[140:26] breaks down as well. So like you know
[140:28] there's a lot of you know nature well
[140:30] there is another way
[140:34] maybe but um you know nature nature is
[140:36] an interesting character because
[140:37] everyone you know like on the left on
[140:40] the right in economics everyone hates
[140:41] him and he just like he he triggers
[140:43] everybody um which is why I personally
[140:45] love him but I I I just wanted to pull
[140:48] on the the thing of um of barbarism
[140:52] savagery and then also what was
[140:54] mentioned at the end of um that quote
[140:57] right there which
[140:58] is
[141:00] people have been softened in modern
[141:03] civilization. We've been softened to the
[141:05] point where uh we ignore our impulses
[141:10] for you know you can call it barbarism
[141:12] savagery or whatever but like the
[141:14] impulse to actually get up and do
[141:17] something that exerts one is traded for
[141:21] comfort and safety and there is a there
[141:23] is a in my opinion someone like nature
[141:26] wasn't uh arguing against for example uh
[141:30] the the capacity to increase your power
[141:33] through economic means and private
[141:34] property. In fact, I I think nature many
[141:36] times has warned against uh democracy
[141:40] and all of the stupidity that would
[141:41] occur if we start to um you know go down
[141:45] the the non-economic path. Right? So he
[141:47] he you know he's never really been a a
[141:50] critic of that. What he was a critic of
[141:52] was the li the excessive liberalization
[141:54] and softening of civilization which
[141:56] would lead to the weak men state. And
[141:59] when you get to weak men, you end up
[142:02] with bad times because weak men are the
[142:04] ones that decide to print money. Weak
[142:06] men are the ones that decide to create a
[142:08] society in which cheating is um uh
[142:11] glorified, right? So like if you think
[142:12] about strength, and I have this
[142:14] definition in the book, strength is not
[142:16] getting into a ring and beating up a
[142:18] little child, right? Like I'm not
[142:20] stronger because I kicked, you know, a
[142:21] 5-year-old in the face. I'm stronger if
[142:24] I get into the ring and exert myself or
[142:26] push myself, right? and channel my my
[142:29] energy in some in some capacity. So
[142:31] strength is more about punching up than
[142:33] punching down. And that was I think you
[142:36] know the the crux of nature's philosophy
[142:37] is that
[142:40] you he wasn't interested as much in the
[142:43] means but more in the ends of you if
[142:46] you're going to construct the
[142:47] civilization you must you must you must
[142:50] you must have a relationship to to power
[142:54] strength um you know the the the savage
[142:59] impulse in the sense not to just go and
[143:02] take somebody else's but to be able to
[143:05] expand and to conquer, right? That was
[143:07] the sort of idea. It's like when Cortez
[143:10] sailed from Spain to um you know the
[143:14] Americas like they went they had this
[143:17] will to power fundamentally speaking to
[143:20] go and change the universe or change the
[143:22] world through the prism that they saw um
[143:26] as more correct and their version of
[143:29] civilization brought us what we have
[143:31] today you know Columbus the same etc
[143:33] etc. So I think there's um in my opinion
[143:37] like the the Hoppian ideal or the Mesian
[143:40] ideal actually matches more with um
[143:42] nature than it doesn't. Um for for me if
[143:46] I if I had to pinpoint what NZ's
[143:48] criticism was was around excessive
[143:51] liberal liberalization which is ties
[143:53] into what we discussed earlier. You know
[143:54] he his critique was about don't make men
[143:58] weak um and don't institute democracy
[144:01] where every lemming gets a vote because
[144:05] then you will optimize society for
[144:08] average and it will devolve. If you want
[144:11] a strong society you need to optimize
[144:12] for excellence. That was that was sort
[144:14] of nech's conceptualization of things
[144:16] and then you need the economic framework
[144:19] for that. So in this case sun steel and
[144:22] stake would be the equivalent of misuses
[144:25] would be the foundation. You need that
[144:27] because if you do not do that I don't
[144:29] give a how much purpose progress
[144:31] all sort of stuff you're talking about.
[144:32] If you are eating seed oils and you're
[144:35] in the dark and you never lift anything
[144:38] you're not going to achieve any of that.
[144:39] So you need the economic basis. So like
[144:41] meian Austrian thinking is that but to
[144:44] transcend that you need this sort of
[144:46] nitin ideal of progress, power and
[144:48] purpose like you need to push beyond
[144:50] what is just um what makes sense on the
[144:53] spreadsheet, right? So so you need to
[144:56] have that vitality like you need to have
[144:58] the the courage, the heart, the spirit
[145:01] of a of Alexander or Napoleon, someone
[145:03] who wants to bend the universe. This is,
[145:06] you know, the the the people who exhibit
[145:09] that today in my opinion are people like
[145:11] Steve Jobs or Jeff Bezos, right? Like
[145:13] they are able to take that energy and
[145:16] create something that nobody thought was
[145:19] possible. Imagine being laughed at like
[145:21] Bezos being laughed at for a decade
[145:24] about this idea that you could build
[145:25] this business that can produce that.
[145:27] Yes, I know there's arguments about oh,
[145:29] you know, this was only possible in a
[145:30] fiat world, yada yada yada, but
[145:32] ultimately like he used that and he bent
[145:36] uh civilization in such a way that he
[145:38] created something that was before
[145:40] thought impossible and he impacted
[145:43] everything. Um so so anyway, that's
[145:45] that's sort of like what I would go in
[145:48] and um and just say is like a a defense
[145:51] of nature to Mises.
[145:54] Yes. All right. Well, man, this has been
[145:57] uh this has been really fascinating and
[145:59] very interesting discussion. I enjoyed
[146:00] this a lot. So, um tell us more about
[146:03] what you're up to these days, um Alex,
[146:05] and where people can find you and find
[146:07] your work other than the safe. That's
[146:09] that's that's where we can wrap it up. I
[146:11] mean, I've um if people want to like I
[146:13] highly recommend everybody watch the
[146:14] two-minute trailer. I made a trailer for
[146:16] the book and they can see that on
[146:19] bashidtoofbitcoin.com and it it'll blow
[146:22] your mind. I promise you. Like, it's the
[146:23] best trailer you'll ever see uh on a
[146:25] book.
[146:27] Um I have uh since we last spoke
[146:30] obviously we spoke about a year and a
[146:31] half ago I was building Spirit of
[146:32] Satoshi at that time. So just as an
[146:34] update to everyone we ended up open
[146:35] sourcing it. We couldn't figure out how
[146:37] to commercialize it and you know such as
[146:40] the uh the realities of building stuff
[146:44] in the real world sometimes just doesn't
[146:46] work. You know we we built it we ended
[146:48] up I remember when I demoed it with you
[146:50] it was still pretty crap. We ended up
[146:52] getting it very very very good. Like we
[146:54] would ask it even random questions like
[146:56] um you know tell me about Joe Biden and
[146:58] it would say he's a you know war
[146:59] criminal and blah blah blah. We're like
[147:00] whoa okay it was it was funny but we
[147:04] just we couldn't figure out how to
[147:05] commercialize it. Unfortunately there
[147:06] wasn't a market for a Bitcoin only LLM.
[147:08] So we open sourced it. We put it on um
[147:10] on Hugging Face so anybody can download
[147:11] it and use it there. And since then I
[147:13] moved on to building a platform which is
[147:15] kind of like a a Noster app but a
[147:17] different kind. So I've been passionate
[147:19] about like travel and you know this idea
[147:23] of the sovereign individual lifestyle um
[147:25] and you know health and geo arbitrage
[147:29] and building network states and you know
[147:32] being outside of the system for a long
[147:34] time and we're trying to build something
[147:36] where it kind of combines the social
[147:38] element um events uh merchants so you
[147:43] can find anything where like you can
[147:44] find merchants that are seed oil free or
[147:46] you know bitcoin only and steak,
[147:49] carnival, like all this sort of stuff
[147:50] that kind of combines all of these
[147:51] things in this kind of like new
[147:54] directory/social app. So, it's it's very
[147:57] interesting. It's like I I can't
[147:59] describe it in a single sentence
[148:01] because I guess similar to how Facebook
[148:03] before Facebook, you couldn't really
[148:04] describe what Facebook was. This is kind
[148:06] of like that. It's a it's a new category
[148:08] defining product. But that's where all
[148:10] my focus is. Bashidito of Bitcoin and
[148:12] that I'm writing a part two to the
[148:13] Bashidto of Bitcoin called the
[148:15] metaphysics of war and beauty and this
[148:18] is a it's sort of like a it extends on
[148:20] some of the ideas from the Bashidto of
[148:22] Bitcoin. It kind of uh it's kind of like
[148:24] the metaphysics behind the the the
[148:26] Bashida. So I'm working on that and also
[148:29] the the Bitcoin times I've actually
[148:31] handed off to Canute and Luke from the
[148:33] Freedom Footprint show. So they're going
[148:35] to be leading that from now on because
[148:36] I'm trying to like simplify my life and
[148:38] just focus on two things. My
[148:40] professional life is Atlantis and my
[148:44] private sort of writing life is
[148:45] Bashidito. So there'll be a whole series
[148:47] of Bashidto books which I'm sure we'll
[148:49] end up publishing the whole series with
[148:51] you at some point. Nice. Well, that's
[148:53] wonderful to hear, man. Thank you so
[148:55] much again and uh yeah, keep uh keep
[148:58] turnurning out great books. Thank you,
[149:00] my friend. Thank you for having me on
[149:01] and thank you for the great
[149:02] conversation. A thanks. My pleasure.
[149:04] Take care. You
[149:06] too.
[149:11] [Music]
[149:16] Yeah. Heat.
