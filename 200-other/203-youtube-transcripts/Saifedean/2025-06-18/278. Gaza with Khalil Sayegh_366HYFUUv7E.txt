[00:05] Hello, welcome to the Bitcoin standard
[00:06] podcast. Our guest today is Khaled S.
[00:08] Khaled is the executive director of the
[00:10] Agora Initiative. He is a Palestinian
[00:12] from Gaza who has been living in the
[00:14] United States and has been working on
[00:16] trying to find solutions or try and find
[00:20] ways out of the current catastrophe
[00:22] befalling Gaza and the rest of the
[00:24] region. I've come to know Khaled over
[00:26] the last couple of years and I'm uh very
[00:29] thankful for him for doing the work that
[00:31] he is doing and I thought it would be
[00:33] very interesting to introduce my viewers
[00:34] to his work and to his experience as a
[00:38] Palestinian Christian from Gaza who has
[00:41] uh family in Gaza who's lost family in
[00:44] the current war and has been trying to
[00:47] make sense of it and trying to find a
[00:49] way forward. So Khad thank you so much
[00:51] for joining us. Thank you, Sy. Looking
[00:53] forward to our conversation.
[00:56] So, um I guess we should uh start with
[00:59] your background. Tell us a little bit
[01:00] about you, how you grew up, where you
[01:03] grew up, and u how life got you to where
[01:06] you are now. Yeah, I was born and raised
[01:09] in Gaza. uh in 1994 was literally the
[01:12] year where the Palestinian Authority
[01:14] would enter Gaza and there was some sort
[01:16] of hope that the occupation would end
[01:18] and that the Israelis would finally
[01:20] allow Palestinians some level of freedom
[01:22] in a two-state solution. Uh I happen to
[01:25] be born to a Palestinian Christian
[01:27] refugee family. And I say Palestinian,
[01:30] it's very clear what's the definition.
[01:31] Christian also is clear, but a refugee.
[01:34] What does this mean? Many people ask me.
[01:36] It's actually uh uh the story of my
[01:39] family where it started in 1948. Uh my
[01:41] family originally are not from Gaza.
[01:43] They were originally from a city located
[01:45] in southern part of historical Palestine
[01:47] uh that used to be called Mashdal. Today
[01:49] Majdal is completely wiped off of Tamab
[01:51] and there is a Jewish city that exists
[01:53] on behalf in in the place of Mashdal
[01:55] that's called Ashkan. And that's I think
[01:57] the story of my family and many people
[01:59] in Gaza where literally their families
[02:02] uh were pushed out of of their own
[02:04] homes. um my grandpa uh uh and grandma
[02:07] were pushed out of their homes. Their
[02:09] property were confiscated in 1948 and
[02:12] they found themselves in Gaza. So I was
[02:14] born to this context, a context where
[02:16] I've heard all the time from my grandpa
[02:19] about the stories of the property he
[02:21] owned, the land, the jewelry shops that
[02:23] he owned back in what's today known as
[02:25] as the state of Israel used to be known
[02:27] as the historical Palestine. And all of
[02:30] that was the context I was born on. Um,
[02:32] so I was born impacted by the Nakban
[02:35] that happened to my family in 1948, but
[02:38] also of the occupation in Gaza. When I
[02:40] was in Gaza, uh, uh, back then the
[02:42] Israeli settlers still controlled Gaza.
[02:44] You were about 8,000 settlers that are
[02:46] in Gaza. And the 8,000 settlers that
[02:49] were in Gaza literally control the life
[02:50] of a million Palestinians. Back then, we
[02:52] used to be million before 2005. Now in
[02:55] Gaza, we are over 2 million people. But
[02:57] imagine the reality. We were living in a
[02:59] reality where about 8,000 settlers in
[03:01] Gaza, control your water, control your
[03:03] electricity, control your freedom of
[03:05] movement. So all of that impacted me as
[03:07] a kid. I was going to honor a school,
[03:09] specific United Nations schools for
[03:12] refugees. And I remember very clearly
[03:14] that sometimes our classes had to be
[03:16] cancelled because teachers are not
[03:18] allowed to come because the borders
[03:20] between south of Gaza and north of Gaza
[03:23] have been closed. I remember the
[03:25] bombing. Um I was introduced first to
[03:27] the Israelis when they bombed uh Gaza in
[03:30] 200 when when the second antifar broke
[03:33] out. So that's the kind of reality I
[03:35] lived in Gaza growing up as as a child.
[03:38] Then I moved to the West Bank in 2008
[03:40] after the first war on Gaza. So even
[03:43] even after all these bombardments Gaza
[03:46] went through during the second etc. we
[03:48] still haven't experienced the worst. And
[03:49] the worst to me seemed like the 2008 war
[03:53] when all of the sudden Israel bombs
[03:54] Gaza. I was literally in my school, my
[03:56] honorable school in in in neighborhood
[03:59] in Gaza city and all of a sudden say I'm
[04:02] looking from my window and 200 policemen
[04:05] who were in their graduation
[04:07] vanished with one missile from the
[04:09] Israeli F16. So I've seen 200 people in
[04:11] front of my eyes vanishing. I get out of
[04:14] the school. Uh everything is my my class
[04:16] became all smokey. The smoke of of of
[04:19] the missile is all over my class. I'm
[04:20] running away from my school and I see
[04:23] bodies everywhere. Bodies of of people
[04:25] and literally parts of their bodies. Uh
[04:27] I literally had to cross over the blood
[04:30] and the bodies in order to get to my
[04:32] home. And on my way, I remember I was
[04:35] only 14. In my way to home, I I I start
[04:38] telling myself, there is no way on earth
[04:40] I'm going to stay in Gaza. I I can't
[04:42] live through that. I can't live through
[04:43] more wars. I understood that Hamas is
[04:45] not going to give up at this point.
[04:47] Israel is not going to give up and that
[04:48] this war will happen over and over
[04:50] again. And I decided to move to the West
[04:52] Bank and there in the West Bank 2000 um
[04:55] 2009 I moved to the West Bank. I still
[04:58] found myself under the occupation. So I
[05:00] was in Ramallah relatively a bit more
[05:02] quieter than uh than where I lived in
[05:05] Gaza. I I start working uh hard by
[05:09] myself. I was 15 going to work at
[05:11] restaurants in Ramallah and at at night
[05:13] trying to study by myself. I did
[05:14] homeschooling because I left school in
[05:16] Gaza. Went through high school while
[05:18] working. Then went to a seminary in
[05:21] Bethlehem, studied theology for my
[05:22] undergrad. Then I moved here to
[05:24] Washington DC to receive my masters in
[05:26] political science with the hope that
[05:28] I'll go back to the West Bank and help
[05:30] educate more people and uh you know
[05:32] bring American ideas, democracy,
[05:34] constitutionalism, etc.
[05:36] tried to go back and the Israeli
[05:37] occupation um uh uh did not allow me to
[05:40] go back to uh uh u to to to the West
[05:44] Bank. So that's that's kind of my my
[05:45] background and that's my story.
[05:48] Yeah. Uh that's uh that's a lot for one
[05:52] person's story. Um yeah, I I'm I'm
[05:56] familiar with the history that you
[05:57] mentioned. It was a very different time
[06:00] in 1994. I remember it. I was a
[06:01] 14year-old at that time and uh I
[06:04] remember the uh state of optimism that
[06:06] the world was in at that point that uh
[06:08] finally the Middle East conflict is
[06:10] getting solved. It's all getting
[06:12] resolved and I remember the excitement
[06:14] for us of the possibility that we might
[06:16] be able to go to Gaza soon that uh might
[06:19] get to see Gaza. This was u this was
[06:22] difficult at that time and it's just
[06:24] gotten more and more difficult until
[06:26] then. I've never been uh would have been
[06:29] um would have been something nice but uh
[06:32] yeah so life there continued to be uh
[06:34] terrible unfortunately since you left
[06:37] and uh but your family stayed there
[06:39] right? my family stayed. So I had to
[06:42] live even even the start of it safe is
[06:45] that I had to be a 15 years old living
[06:48] in Ramallah by himself working 16 hours
[06:51] a day in order to make living and and
[06:53] and make it through high school by
[06:56] myself. And for over five years I
[06:59] couldn't see even one member of my
[07:00] family because the Israelis banned them
[07:02] from leaving because we're leaving. And
[07:04] although you are still within the
[07:05] Palestinian territories still the
[07:06] Israelis consider someone like myself
[07:08] illegal. So all of a sudden I'm being
[07:11] chased by the Israeli military in the
[07:12] West Bank. All of a sudden I'm afraid
[07:14] that they will send me back. And for
[07:15] five years I didn't see my family. And
[07:17] then when they allowed my family to get
[07:18] out on Christmas or Easter because
[07:20] they're Christians and sometimes they
[07:21] allowed them to leave for the holy
[07:23] sides. I was able to see my mom one time
[07:26] in those in those like 15 years I stayed
[07:30] not 15 12 years I stayed in those. My
[07:32] mom I saw twice and my dad I saw only
[07:34] once who was killed during this war. So,
[07:38] so all these severation of families is
[07:41] also part of the reality of the
[07:42] Palestinians experience and one that
[07:44] people don't think of when they hear of
[07:45] Gaza or the West Bank or all the
[07:47] complexity of Palestine. And then I left
[07:49] I left um
[07:52] the West Bank and came here. I I made a
[07:54] good life relatively here in the US. And
[07:56] then this war happens and you know
[07:59] October 7 starts and and since day one I
[08:02] realize that this going to be hell for
[08:03] the Palestinians because I know the
[08:06] criminality of the Israeli regime and I
[08:08] know how they respond to even the
[08:09] slightest uh small action by the
[08:11] Palestinians. So to see uh obviously I
[08:14] was one of the few that thought October
[08:16] 7 was a terrible idea because of
[08:18] strategically it will it will have
[08:20] precautions and also there are moral
[08:21] questions there but regardless of that I
[08:24] understood it would be held to bay on
[08:26] October 8th 2023 our home was bombed so
[08:30] October 7 happened the day after we I
[08:32] didn't still process what happened our
[08:34] home was bombed by miracle it was that
[08:36] my family has survived all of a sudden
[08:38] they're in the street they're homeless
[08:39] they're calling me I don't know what the
[08:41] hell to do I'm here in Washington DC. I
[08:43] don't know what to do. And they ended up
[08:45] at the church in Gaza City. We thought,
[08:46] okay, the church might be safe. And then
[08:49] October uh 19 of 19, sorry, of October
[08:54] 2023. All of a sudden, I hear that St.
[08:56] Puria's church was bombed. I was
[08:58] terrified. I said, "Okay, I lost my
[09:00] family or whatever." I I'm calling and
[09:02] I'm calling and then I realize my family
[09:04] has survived. Nothing happened to my
[09:05] family. But some of my relatives were
[09:07] killed. My friend Ram Zasuri who's also
[09:10] my uh relative lost the three of his
[09:12] kids' life. All his kids were gone. He
[09:16] just by miracle that he survived. Him
[09:17] and his wife went to visit his older his
[09:20] elderly father in the other room and
[09:22] they just left the room and the room
[09:24] that was found within the church. We
[09:26] lost 17 people that night and a lot of
[09:29] injured Christians in that night. And
[09:32] then it continued right on December
[09:34] 21st,
[09:36] few days before Christmas. The Israelis
[09:38] would snipe down three three people at
[09:40] the church in Holy Family Catholic
[09:43] Church. Two Christian woman would die.
[09:45] And that day it was Israeli tanks were
[09:47] surrounding the church not allowing
[09:48] people in and out. All hospitals in Gaza
[09:51] City were destroyed by Israel. My father
[09:54] goes through um heart attack or panic
[09:57] attack. Again, we don't know what
[09:59] happened because there were no doctors
[10:00] and there were no ambulances. the
[10:02] Israelis allowed and there were no
[10:03] hospitals and I lost my father and the
[10:07] the fact is that we don't know what even
[10:10] happened to him. He was a healthy six 67
[10:13] years old so is is insane because there
[10:15] is no doctor or hospitals that Israel
[10:18] has allowed there. Then I thought that
[10:20] would be the worst thing that would
[10:21] happen to me and I start working hard to
[10:23] get my family out. We had to pay a lot
[10:25] of money to get them through the border.
[10:27] But as they were walking out of Gaza
[10:29] City,
[10:31] they had to walk about seven miles to to
[10:34] go from the south to the north,
[10:37] they're not allowed to take a car, a
[10:39] donkey, or even a bicycle to go through
[10:41] through that road. And it was a really
[10:44] uh hot day on April. My sister and my
[10:46] mother are walking by themselves through
[10:48] the Israeli checkpoints, through Israeli
[10:50] tanks, etc. All of a sudden, my sister
[10:52] collapsed. We don't know what happened
[10:54] to her. They say it might be a heat
[10:56] stock. We don't know again because
[10:57] they're not checking anymore at the
[10:59] hospitals and she collapsed. My mom also
[11:02] collapsed with her and there were no one
[11:03] to help them over there because they're
[11:05] not allowing cars to get in and the
[11:07] Israeli mil military literally watching
[11:10] them watching them being tortured walk
[11:12] for forced to walk seven miles because
[11:15] that's a road that the Israelis
[11:16] destroyed and force you to walk through
[11:18] it. We start calling it the walk the the
[11:20] the street of death or the road of death
[11:22] because so many people have lost their
[11:24] lives there either by Israeli kawat
[11:26] capttors who just collapsed like my
[11:27] sister. Then my two of my Muslim friends
[11:30] actually risked their life and got in
[11:33] through the other way a way that they
[11:35] would shoot at you and they start
[11:36] shooting at them the Israelis to just
[11:38] rescue my mother and my sister. It was
[11:41] too late for my 17 years old sister
[11:43] because she died already. Uh we don't
[11:46] know what happened and it but it wasn't
[11:48] late for my mom and my mom survived. She
[11:50] was in a coma for couple of days and
[11:52] then she woke up and obviously it was
[11:53] horrifying when she woke up that she
[11:56] learned that my sister has been has been
[11:59] killed. Um so that's the reality that my
[12:03] family is is living through. But that's
[12:04] the thing say this is not a reality that
[12:07] is unique to Khalil. That's the reality
[12:08] of every Palestinian family in Gaza
[12:11] today. Uh I also lost my best friend in
[12:16] Muhammad Yari who was a Palestinian
[12:18] Muslim. Uh one of the best humans I ever
[12:21] known was a really close friend of mine.
[12:23] Uh I remember growing up to listen to
[12:26] his rap. He used to rap at school and
[12:28] both in English and Arabic was really
[12:30] creative, full of life, full of of of
[12:33] joy and were happened to become a
[12:36] photographer for Lazira was killed with
[12:38] his wife uh and his child. Another
[12:41] friend of mine who was really one of the
[12:43] top students at schools and by no
[12:46] surprise that he became a doctor went to
[12:48] Kings London medical school came back to
[12:51] Gaza was killed with his wife as well
[12:53] newly married. So the the story I'm
[12:56] telling is a story that is is
[12:59] unfortunately
[13:00] um widespread in Gaza. A story that
[13:02] we're living over and over every day
[13:04] there is a l from Gaza who's losing his
[13:07] sister and his father and his his
[13:09] mother. The Bitcoin Standard podcast is

[14:11] The Bitcoin standard podcast is brought
[14:13] to you by the daylight computer. I love
[14:15] to work early in the morning and late at
[14:16] night or in the sun outdoors, but
[14:18] regular computer screens are terrible at
[14:20] these times and they strain your eyes.
[14:22] For years, I've wanted a paper-like
[14:24] electronic screen on a simple computer I
[14:27] could use to write. I tried several
[14:29] models, but none were very good. Now,
[14:31] finally, Daylight have delivered a
[14:34] fantastic full function tablet with a
[14:36] paper-like screen that's easy on your
[14:38] eyes and great for outdoor use. I've
[14:41] been using the Daylight computer to
[14:42] write my next book, and it is absolutely
[14:45] fantastic, and it has led me to invest
[14:47] in this company myself. Check out my
[14:49] interview with Anjan Kata in episode
[14:52] 249.
[14:54] Yeah. Well, my condolences. Um, I don't
[14:57] know what to tell you. It's uh, so it's
[14:59] obviously very horrible to hear that and
[15:02] um, thank you for your courage of
[15:03] speaking about it. I think it's it's
[15:05] it's difficult obviously, but it's very
[15:07] important that somebody does. I think
[15:09] it's um, it's been for too long that uh,
[15:13] the um, the perspective of u
[15:16] Palestinians is just completely ignored.
[15:18] The idea that Palestinians can just be
[15:20] innocent civilians has been um
[15:24] almost entirely uh blotted out and
[15:28] people just uh refuse to acknowledge it.
[15:31] Um, and I think the really depressing
[15:34] thing about it, uh, beyond the gruesome
[15:38] suffering, I think the more depressing
[15:41] thing is the context in which it is
[15:43] placed, which is that essentially, you
[15:46] know, your grandparents were kicked out
[15:48] of their homes for no fault of their
[15:50] own. They didn't do anything. They
[15:51] didn't commit any crimes, but they were
[15:54] kicked out of their homes. And then your
[15:56] parents, same thing happens to them
[15:59] also. it wasn't any fault of theirs.
[16:01] They didn't u they didn't do anything to
[16:04] u deserve this. They they didn't commit
[16:07] any crimes to do this. And it's just I
[16:10] think this is uh sadly that the
[16:14] Palestinian tragedy is just uh your mere
[16:16] existence is Mhm. construed as guilt and
[16:22] is befitting punishment. So you just
[16:25] happen to be alive somewhere where other
[16:28] people want the land and so therefore
[16:31] you know bad things are going to happen
[16:33] to you and it's just uh considered to be
[16:35] accepted because uh the the entire
[16:38] concept of human beings owning their
[16:40] property and owning their lives is
[16:42] somehow invalidated when it comes to
[16:45] Palestinians and their property because
[16:47] of some reasons somehow. Yeah. And
[16:50] that's that's the crazy part is that
[16:53] when 1948 happened, so many people were
[16:56] bushed out, right? And the Zionist
[16:57] narrative was like, "Oh, they just left
[16:59] by themselves." And I'm like, "Okay,
[17:01] okay, they left by themselves. So why
[17:03] weren't they allowed back? Let's assume
[17:05] they left by themselves." Which is not
[17:07] true. Obviously, it's fiction. Even
[17:08] Israeli historians today, they say, "No,
[17:11] we kicked out the Palestinians." And
[17:12] there are two schools of thoughts in
[17:14] Israel. One that says, "We kicked out
[17:15] the Palestinians and that's good. We
[17:17] have to do it." And the other is more
[17:18] lifted. They said, "Oh, it's a tragedy
[17:20] that would happen, but yes, we did it."
[17:22] But they say, "No, we they just left by
[17:24] themselves." I'm like, "Okay, why
[17:25] weren't they allowed if they left by
[17:27] themselves?" Okay, if they left by
[17:29] themselves, why was their property
[17:31] literally confiscated? Where in the
[17:33] world would your own private property be
[17:35] confiscated by law? There's literally a
[17:38] law called the absent low property,
[17:41] which means if you're absent from the
[17:43] state of Israel, your property is is
[17:45] confiscated. if you're an Arab abstent
[17:47] obviously or a Palestinian before 48 but
[17:50] you kick them out and if you try to get
[17:52] back they'll kill you on the border they
[17:54] literally shot so many people who were
[17:56] forced into Gaza tried to get back and
[17:59] and and and killed them and in our story
[18:01] in Mashdal's story those who did not
[18:03] leave there were 5,000 who stayed in
[18:05] Mashd were forced out of Masdul in 1952
[18:09] so right after the war is over they
[18:11] still were ethnic cleansing people and
[18:13] today this is happening again today this
[18:15] is happening again in the West Bank
[18:17] today. There's incremental ethnic
[18:19] cleansing in all areas. See, we're
[18:21] seeing this in Msafar Yata in southern
[18:23] hills of Hebrron. We're seeing this also
[18:25] in Gaza where the ethnic cleansing is
[18:27] right in the open coupled with a
[18:30] genocide and yet no one seems to to care
[18:33] as you said because the Palestinian life
[18:35] is just deemed uh unworthy for them. And
[18:37] it's crazy to me because as Christian
[18:40] right I am quite immersed in in in
[18:42] Christianity obviously because that's
[18:44] what I've built trained in theology but
[18:45] also western thoughts that I tend to
[18:48] believe based on Christianity and
[18:50] there's nowhere to be found the idea
[18:53] that a life could be less equal than the
[18:55] others. The entire notion of of of this
[18:57] country at least the United States of
[18:59] America is based on the equality of
[19:00] human beings. And I don't find any text
[19:04] that suggested a Palestinian life is
[19:06] worth less than anyone else. It's insane
[19:08] to me.
[19:10] Yeah. Well, I mean, um,
[19:13] founding texts of the state of Israel
[19:15] clearly suggest that. I mean, it says
[19:16] it's a state. Um, it's it's a it's it's
[19:20] a state that's not defined by its uh
[19:22] residents and citizens. It's not a state
[19:26] for its citizens. It's a state for an
[19:28] ethnic group, an ethnoreigious group.
[19:31] And so therefore, you know, you're
[19:32] mentioning 1948. Uh, as you said,
[19:35] clearly um close to a million
[19:37] Palestinians were expelled from their
[19:39] homes, but they weren't allowed back.
[19:40] And instead, people from all over the
[19:42] world with no connection to the land,
[19:44] with no property on the land, with no
[19:46] claim for any property, with no family
[19:48] connections anywhere can just move there
[19:52] and get assigned property from the
[19:54] Israeli government, which stole
[19:56] something like 70 80% of the country.
[19:59] and uh made it government property and
[20:02] then it assigns it to people from all
[20:04] over the world based on their belonging
[20:06] or their claiming to belong to an
[20:08] ethnoreigious group but it doesn't allow
[20:11] the legitimate owners of this property
[20:13] to return to it and in many cases even
[20:17] when those legitimate property owners
[20:19] are citizens of Israel. I think this is
[20:21] a truly wonderful uh illustration of it.
[20:24] there's this um a Christian village in
[20:27] the north of uh Palestine called
[20:30] and in that village IQ RIT T you can
[20:33] read the Wikipedia page on it. It's it
[20:35] was a Christian village and it was u u
[20:37] depopulated
[20:39] basically the the the residents were
[20:40] murdered and expelled in 1948 and some
[20:43] of the residents stayed uh became
[20:45] refugees inside what became Israel and
[20:48] so they became uh residents in cities in
[20:52] uh that uh in Hifa or Yafa and they
[20:55] became citizens of Israel but they can't
[20:57] go back to their property in that
[20:58] village because it is it's been
[21:01] depopulated and now the military
[21:03] controls it and they're not allowed to
[21:06] own that property. But Jewish
[21:08] settlements can take parts of that
[21:10] property and they can take that lands
[21:12] and so foreigners who have no connection
[21:15] to the property can get it can they end
[21:17] up getting assigned to that property.
[21:19] They can't own it so they can't sell it
[21:21] but they can lease it at favorable rates
[21:23] from the government but the rightful
[21:24] owners of the property cannot.
[21:28] Yeah, that's crazy. and and even even
[21:30] the church of Ban that that village that
[21:33] was destroyed is not allowed to be
[21:34] rebuilt. I went there and I saw these
[21:36] villages with one of their survivals of
[21:38] this of this incident and they can't go
[21:40] back. They can't rebuild it. They can't
[21:42] even go to the church and rebuild it.
[21:44] And that's insane. And this is a this is
[21:45] a country that claims freedom of
[21:47] religion. This is a country that it it
[21:50] hurts me to see Christian brothers and
[21:53] sisters here in the west literally
[21:54] talking about the Juda Christian value
[21:56] or or or supporting Israel because of
[21:58] biblical command or whatever. And in my
[22:00] mind like do you really see churches
[22:03] were destroyed in 1948 and not being
[22:05] allowed to rebuild until today? And
[22:07] you're telling me this is somehow God's
[22:09] like plan for me? I mean I totally
[22:12] reject that. That's insane that this has
[22:14] happened.
[22:16] Yeah. It's a it's a very curious thing
[22:18] how um Christianity in the US has been
[22:22] weaponized to the destruction of
[22:24] Christianity in the Holy Land.
[22:25] Ultimately, this is what um American
[22:28] bombs are paying for. And it's u it it's
[22:32] a stark irony and it's an incredible
[22:33] thing to watch the levels of mental
[22:35] gymnastics that people go through when
[22:37] they try and rationalize it. Um you've
[22:39] spoken at American churches. What has
[22:42] been your experience in terms of uh
[22:44] their perspective on this?
[22:46] You know, I walk in
[22:49] and I say who I am usually and the first
[22:51] question I'm asked when did you convert
[22:53] to Christianity? And and there is an
[22:56] assumption there, right? That that
[22:58] you're from there where
[23:01] Muslim people live, not Christian people
[23:03] live. And I look at them and I say we
[23:06] around perhaps the 3rd century or the
[23:08] first century. That's where my probably
[23:09] my family converted. And they're like,
[23:11] "What do you mean?" I'm like literally
[23:12] the church that Palestinian Christians
[23:14] in Gaza, my church and perfeious church
[23:17] that we worship in in Gaza is literally
[23:19] a church that was built in the third
[23:21] century and since the third century
[23:23] we've been continuously praying there
[23:24] and they're shocked usually. They're
[23:26] surprised. They're like, "Oh yeah, that
[23:28] I mean it makes sense to them, but
[23:30] they're just shocked because in their
[23:31] mind they were programmed in a way to
[23:33] think that the Jewish people are the
[23:35] people who are there and we are just
[23:36] foreigners who invaded somehow or came
[23:38] from uh from a place." The second thing
[23:41] then they come on like the whole
[23:42] question of the Jewish promise right
[23:44] like God has promised the land somehow
[23:46] to the Jews and thus they have to live
[23:48] there and then you know the question I
[23:50] asked them right away is that you know
[23:52] Christianity teaches very clearly that
[23:54] Christians are the people of God right
[23:56] or no they're like yes and they say
[23:58] you're saying that the Jewish people are
[24:00] also the people of God and they say yeah
[24:01] like yes because that's the core of
[24:03] what's so called dispensationalist
[24:05] theology is that God has two people the
[24:08] Christians and the Jews and two distinct
[24:10] plan for the entire world. The plan is
[24:13] the church to believe in Jesus and be
[24:14] redeemed through his crucifixion and
[24:16] resurrection. And for the Jews, there is
[24:18] a specific plan which is for them to
[24:20] come back to the land of Israel, restore
[24:23] their own earthly kingdom so that the
[24:25] Messiah will come back. That's that's
[24:27] the plan they're telling me. So I tell
[24:28] them very simply, so you believe that
[24:31] what happened in 1948 what God God plan?
[24:34] And so many of them would say yes. And
[24:36] then I tell them so it was God's plan
[24:38] for the Jewish people who still don't
[24:39] believe in the Messiah to come back to
[24:41] the land and kick out more than 20% of
[24:44] the Christians who made more than 20% of
[24:47] the population back then in order to
[24:50] establish their own earthly kingdom. So
[24:52] for the earthly kingdom of Israel they
[24:53] destroyed the churches which is part of
[24:55] the heavenly kingdom. And for them this
[24:57] is a shocker site because they don't
[25:00] know they don't know that churches were
[25:02] destroyed in 1948. They don't know that
[25:04] Christians were killed and kicked out
[25:05] from their homes. So it's surprising and
[25:07] and unboggling. So I do have this kind
[25:10] of experiences. But in addition, I do
[25:12] have a lot of positive experiences. I do
[25:14] have a sense as I'm I've been doing this
[25:16] since 2018. I've been speaking at
[25:18] churches. I I I was an intern at
[25:20] Southern Baptist Church here down in in
[25:22] Manasses when I was trained in theology
[25:24] before. So I've been doing this for
[25:26] years and I'm seeing more and more how
[25:28] less and less pastors and and and
[25:30] Christian leaders are believing in
[25:32] what's so called dispensationalist
[25:33] theology which is closely associated
[25:36] with with with Zionists Christian
[25:39] theology less and less people believe in
[25:41] it and the reason why not only the
[25:44] question of Palestine the reason why is
[25:46] that the new evangelical scholars who
[25:49] are looking on the Bible start realizing
[25:51] that that the entire presuppositions
[25:54] that dispensationalist theology and John
[25:56] Darby sort of theology and understanding
[25:58] of the word has been based on actually
[26:01] bad reading of the Bible. Matter of
[26:04] fact, John Darby didn't speak Hebrew or
[26:06] who who came out with this conceptual
[26:08] theology didn't speak Hebrew or Greek.
[26:10] So this is a guy who was reading the
[26:11] scripture not in the original language
[26:14] and making all sort of assumptions and
[26:16] claim and today serious scholars like
[26:18] anti-right and like others um are
[26:20] looking more back and saying no actually
[26:22] this sensation theology is is it doesn't
[26:25] make sense and what makes sense is that
[26:27] God has one covenant with one people and
[26:29] that is the church and not any earthly
[26:32] people on this earth. The Bitcoin

[28:03] Yeah, I mean I think uh you know I don't
[28:05] claim to be an expert in Christian
[28:07] theology but um
[28:10] everything I've ever learned about
[28:11] Christianity and I go to a Quaker school
[28:13] so uh I'm kind of familiar um is very
[28:19] contradictory to the notion that you
[28:21] would want to give billions and billions
[28:23] of dollars to a military that's uh
[28:26] directed consciously and knowingly u
[28:29] mass murdering civilians. I think the
[28:33] the the levels of propaganda that the
[28:35] average American is subjected to on
[28:37] every level. You know, they're um
[28:39] subjected to propaganda on the basis
[28:41] that this is a religious duty, which is
[28:43] ridiculous. Then they're subjected to
[28:45] propaganda on the idea that this is
[28:46] somehow in the interests of the US. The
[28:49] US um was around for almost two
[28:52] centuries before uh Israel came into
[28:54] existence. And during that time, the US
[28:56] basically never had anything to do with
[28:59] the Middle East. practically never sent
[29:01] a soldier to the Middle East. Never
[29:03] fired a bullet there with, you know,
[29:05] exception of a few pilots at some point,
[29:08] but basically had no interest in
[29:10] anything in the Middle East. Had no
[29:11] danger. Nobody got killed. No Americans
[29:13] got killed in the Middle East. No
[29:14] Americans got attacked. Had no um no
[29:17] reason to be involved with anything
[29:19] there except trading with people and
[29:21] maybe taking in immigrants if they
[29:23] wanted to. But uh now it's portrayed as
[29:26] if it is the uh existential uh the
[29:30] existential crisis of America. America
[29:33] needs to ensure democracy in the Middle
[29:35] East and America needs to spread all
[29:37] kinds of things, you know, whatever the
[29:40] buzzword of the month is that America
[29:43] needs to work on in the Middle East. And
[29:44] if it doesn't do it, then somehow it's a
[29:46] massive catastrophe. And so thankfully
[29:48] we've got Israel out there fighting
[29:50] these wars for us to help us enforce our
[29:53] will or you know our values or whatever
[29:56] it is. But it's just so ridiculous. And
[29:58] this whole notion of you know a lot of
[30:00] people like to portray it as if it's oh
[30:02] well it's American empire and we need
[30:04] this for our American imperialism and
[30:06] it's uh it's necessary and this is just
[30:08] what empires are all about and it's
[30:11] ridiculous. America has absolutely
[30:12] nothing to gain from anything in the
[30:14] Middle East. I think anybody could take
[30:16] over the Middle East tomorrow and it
[30:19] doesn't matter who they are. Um, but the
[30:22] the worst thing that they can do is sell
[30:24] the oil on the global market. Doesn't
[30:27] matter who they are, what kind of
[30:29] ideology they have. And even if they
[30:31] don't sell the oil on the global market,
[30:33] even if they burn all of the oil, the US
[30:36] can survive without all of the Middle
[30:37] Eastern oil. And the Middle East
[30:39] produces a lot of oil, but it's not
[30:41] indispensable. there are a lot of other
[30:42] places in the world that produce oil.
[30:44] And so this notion that there's a
[30:47] there's some kind of u geopolitical
[30:50] importance to uh all of these wars where
[30:53] the US needs to be pursuing them is all
[30:54] is is equally ridiculous and it's just
[30:56] layer upon layer of fiat Why I
[30:59] think fiat is at the heart of all of
[31:00] this is because it's all justifications
[31:03] for printing money and doing horrible
[31:05] things. And you see this over and over
[31:08] and over again in everything. When you
[31:09] start seeing all these ridiculous
[31:11] justifications that come attached to the
[31:13] money printer, you know that it's about
[31:14] the money printer, not the justification
[31:16] always. Fascinating.
[31:19] Yeah. And and and the thing is like from
[31:21] a public opinion point of view like what
[31:24] American intervention in the Middle East
[31:26] has done is just like increased
[31:28] hostility toward Americans more and more
[31:30] and more, right? And the Zionist and you
[31:32] know hawkish American perspective on
[31:34] that or explanation is that they always
[31:36] hated us because of our freedom right
[31:38] like they just hate us and the truth is
[31:40] that's extremely because the
[31:43] reality is before 1948 the Middle East
[31:45] had extremely favorable view toward
[31:47] Americans and I will give you one
[31:49] example before 48 there was this
[31:51] Palestinian uh educator called Khalis
[31:53] Sakini Khalisini was a Palestinian
[31:56] teacher well-known scholar and in one of
[31:59] his writing one of his letters to his
[32:00] son that I've I've I've read. He writes
[32:04] the following. He said, "I when it comes
[32:06] to the Palestinian fight with the
[32:07] Zionists," he said, "I don't trust the
[32:08] British because they're imperialist,
[32:10] greedy, dangerous. I don't bring trust
[32:13] the French because they're the same.
[32:14] There's one nation under under heaven."
[32:16] He says that I trust on these issues
[32:19] that it can liberate us because they
[32:20] understand freedom and it's the United
[32:22] States of America. And why? He says
[32:24] because they never colonized the nation
[32:26] and they don't have imperial ambitions.
[32:28] and he didn't wait to see the rest. So
[32:30] that's the prominent intellectual view
[32:33] of America before 1948. Obviously after
[32:35] 1948 and especially after 67 and and the
[32:39] the Americans start of more and more
[32:41] supporting Israel and its occupation,
[32:43] things have changed and that's a very
[32:45] negative thing for the United States of
[32:46] America. Why do you want to have all
[32:48] these nations hating you? I I still
[32:50] don't understand it. The notion that
[32:52] it's because their freedom it's have
[32:54] empirically been proven completely
[32:55] wrong.
[32:57] Yeah. No, it's absolutely true. I think
[32:59] it's uh it's a very common misconception
[33:01] obviously today. A lot of people think
[33:03] it's just, you know, this clash of
[33:05] civilization and it was always going
[33:07] destined to be that way that uh um it
[33:10] it's inevitable. But in reality, yeah,
[33:13] relationships particularly with the US
[33:15] were very positive up until really the
[33:18] 1960s.
[33:19] And uh it was u it it there was a
[33:24] natural kind of u partnership there with
[33:27] American oil companies exploring oil and
[33:30] in the in the Middle East making pretty
[33:32] good uh discoveries and making great
[33:36] returns on it. So there was a kind of a
[33:38] very positive relationship but then it
[33:39] all got ruined in the 1960s and it
[33:41] continues to get sabotaged and really
[33:43] for no reason. I mean you don't need the
[33:46] US to take the side of anybody in the
[33:47] conflict. The problem is the US is just
[33:50] completely u completely um on one side
[33:54] in a way that is completely uh changing
[33:56] the balance of power. I mean we saw
[33:58] hundreds of billions of dollars of
[34:00] military aid over the last decades that
[34:03] um empower the worst elements within
[34:05] Israeli society and Israeli politics to
[34:08] always be as maximalist as possible to
[34:12] and because they're protected from any
[34:14] consequences because the US is always
[34:15] there to bail them out. This is the uh
[34:18] this is the real tragedy of it. It's um
[34:21] it Israel on its own would have been a
[34:23] lot more likely to want to settle down
[34:26] um to some kind of accommodation with
[34:28] its neighbors. But with with the fact
[34:30] that it can rely on unending US support
[34:34] means it's just constantly pushing for
[34:36] more land. And this is why it you know
[34:39] people talk about the failure of the
[34:40] two-state solution. Why couldn't it
[34:42] happen? But ultimately what it comes
[34:44] down to the reason the two-state
[34:45] solution fell apart is because of the
[34:47] settlements is because of the continuous
[34:48] absolutely taking of Palestinian land
[34:51] and the continuous you know conscious
[34:53] effort of settlements to make it so that
[34:55] the West Bank cannot be a contiguous
[34:57] territory so that it continues to remain
[35:00] surrounded by Israeli military control.
[35:03] That was the point behind building all
[35:04] of these settlements. And now there's
[35:07] that there's almost a million settlers
[35:10] in the West Bank. And so the point of
[35:12] that is precisely to make it so that
[35:14] Palestinians can't have contiguous
[35:16] territory, can't have sovereign
[35:17] territory, and will continue to live
[35:19] under Israeli control. And of course,
[35:21] you know, the the tragedy here is it
[35:23] isn't like one of these conflicts where,
[35:25] say, um, you know, the Basque want to
[35:27] leave Spain, but Spain wants them to be
[35:29] Spanish citizens, or the Catalans want
[35:31] to leave Spain. No, Spain wants them to
[35:34] remain Spanish citizens. The problem
[35:36] here is that Israel wants the West Bank,
[35:38] but it doesn't want to make the
[35:40] Palestinians into citizens. It doesn't
[35:42] want to give them the vote. And there's
[35:44] nothing the Palestinians can do for this
[35:45] because it's just it's racial. You're
[35:48] not born into the right trac racial
[35:50] group. And so therefore, you just can
[35:53] never become a citizen. So you can
[35:54] remain as a foreigner in your land until
[35:57] somebody finds an excuse to kick you out
[35:59] of your home, until some um pogram comes
[36:03] and kills you or um
[36:07] they they drive you out of your house um
[36:10] through courts or through mobs or
[36:12] through uh just um counterterrorism
[36:16] operations or through administrative
[36:18] reasons or because of military uh
[36:22] confiscation for whatever. ever military
[36:24] justification is given and then you know
[36:27] one at a time one house at a time is
[36:30] being destroyed is being stolen one plot
[36:33] of land at a time is being destroyed
[36:35] stolen and taken away from an owner
[36:39] who's not Jewish and given to the state
[36:42] which only allows Jews to live in it and
[36:45] this is just constantly happening inside
[36:48] of Israel proper 1948 borders in the
[36:51] West Bank and now in Gaza as Well,
[36:55] and I think that's the thing is that
[36:57] they designed it in this way that
[36:58] settlers will prevent the two states
[37:00] from happening. And they didn't like
[37:02] hide it. They've seen it out in the
[37:03] public and they've seen it over and over
[37:05] again. And yet the Americans pretend
[37:07] that that's not an issue. And the other
[37:09] thing is that this is this is completely
[37:11] financed by America. I mean, if the
[37:13] Americans are not supplying enough
[37:15] weapons for them to sustain the
[37:16] occupation, Israel would have paid the
[37:18] price of its occupation and have thought
[37:19] it twice. That's the one thing. The
[37:21] second thing, the way it's financed by
[37:23] American tax dollars is that the insane
[37:25] amount of nonprofit money that goes to
[37:27] these settlements enterprises,
[37:28] unbelievable. You've got one example of
[37:31] this organization called
[37:33] um an Israeli um settlers organization
[37:36] that founded and based in Philadelphia.
[37:39] It pours millions of tens of millions if
[37:42] not hundreds of millions of dollars into
[37:43] investments in real estate. And they're
[37:46] literally the number one reason for
[37:49] driving the Christians out of Jerusalem,
[37:51] for example, because one of their
[37:52] missions is to make Jerusalem Jewish,
[37:54] East Jerusalem, that is completely
[37:56] Jewish, and driving the Christians out.
[37:58] So they target Christian property in
[38:00] specific. They're targeting the Armenian
[38:02] neighborhood right now. They're
[38:03] targeting the what's called the Imperial
[38:05] Hotel, which is an Orthodox owned hotel
[38:07] in in in in East Jerusalem. and and
[38:10] that's a type of of of of organizations
[38:12] that are operating there fully uh uh
[38:15] American fully funded by fear and no one
[38:17] seemed to care about these things and
[38:19] somehow we have to accept the American
[38:21] government as a fair broker of of of
[38:24] peace and that's I think why our work at
[38:27] the Agora Initiative is important
[38:28] because big part of what we try to do
[38:30] safe is try to break to the average
[38:32] American uh where are the obstacles and
[38:35] where Americans could help and as you
[38:37] said Americans could help but By simply
[38:40] staying out of it, even we don't want
[38:42] you as a medator if you don't want to
[38:43] help and broke a peace deal between us,
[38:45] just stay out of it. By staying out of
[38:47] it, you are allowing the Palestinians to
[38:49] take some some some breathe by
[38:52] pressuring Israel because Israel would
[38:54] feel it eventually when Israel start
[38:55] feeling that they're paying dollars to
[38:57] occupy us, occup suppress us, kill us,
[39:00] etc. Perhaps they'll reconsider. We're
[39:02] not sure, but at least perhaps they
[39:04] would. But right now, as is America is
[39:07] literally being the bell, I think it's
[39:09] just like going to continue forever in
[39:11] this in this really vicious circle until
[39:13] they find way to actually think cleanse
[39:15] everyone out.
[39:18] Yeah, sadly it's um it's a very
[39:21] depressing um situation and it doesn't
[39:24] look like it's getting u much better
[39:27] unfortunately. Um tell us more about
[39:29] what you guys are doing at the Agoro
[39:31] Initiative. Before we before we get into
[39:34] that, I should say you're now also
[39:35] taking bitcoin donations. So go to the
[39:38] agora.org
[39:40] and you can donate Bitcoin. But yeah, go
[39:41] ahead. Sure. So it's an organization
[39:44] that I founded uh actually two months
[39:46] before the war started. Um the idea was
[39:49] that we would you know uh u break to the
[39:52] average American more what is going on
[39:55] there and what need to happen in order
[39:56] for for a solution to be achieved. And
[39:58] then the war happened and all these
[40:00] personal tragedies was stopped for a
[40:01] while. Now we're back and we're doing
[40:03] this. We're producing media to explain
[40:05] to the average American what's going on.
[40:07] We are educating. We are advocating.
[40:09] We're working with churches, synagogues,
[40:10] mosques to to to break down these
[40:12] issues. I travel around the US to speak
[40:14] about these issues. Uh uh and in
[40:16] addition to everything we're doing in
[40:18] America and in the West, we're also have
[40:20] our own program that we run in Egypt for
[40:22] Palestinians who lost parents in in Gaza
[40:25] and they don't have the money to
[40:26] continue their education. We also pay
[40:28] for their education. So if you're a a
[40:30] college student in Gaza and you lost
[40:32] your mother and father, then you qualify
[40:34] to apply for this program and we will
[40:36] sponsor you to continue your education.
[40:38] I can give you one uh story that u uh
[40:41] really touched me and um and and one
[40:43] that you helped us with actually uh safe
[40:45] is that this one dental student um uh in
[40:48] Gaza who lost her uh entire family. Uh
[40:52] she's the only survivor with her
[40:53] brother. um we u uh helped her uh to
[40:58] continue her dental school. She she's
[40:59] lost hope completely. Imagine like she
[41:01] lost everyone. She's almost lost her
[41:03] legs too, but she was treated in in um a
[41:07] hospital in Egypt. But then she had to
[41:09] continue her dental school but had no
[41:10] money, no means, etc. So we helped her
[41:13] get an apartment. We she has a rental
[41:15] apartment near um uh near the school in
[41:17] in Egypt. We went through the entire
[41:20] bureaucracy, registered her there and
[41:21] this just last week she finished a one
[41:23] year of of of dental school. So that
[41:26] makes it up to three years with what she
[41:27] did in Gaza. So that's the kind of hope
[41:29] that Agora tried to to bring. So in
[41:32] simple trying to reshape the
[41:33] conversation here in the US meanwhile
[41:35] try to help the most vulnerable uh
[41:37] students in in in Gaza.
[41:40] Wonderful. And the website is the agora
[41:44] initiative.org
[41:46] uh org was it? Yes, correct.org.
[41:51] Excellent.
[41:52] Um all right. Anything else you want to
[41:54] tell us about your activities and work
[41:56] and where to find you? That's all you
[41:58] can find me on Twitter. My Twitter, I
[42:00] mean you could drop it, but it's
