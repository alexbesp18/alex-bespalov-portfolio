[00:01] It says here Bitcoin's rebounding. I
[00:03] guess maybe based on whatever close it
[00:05] had dropped below $99,000
[00:08] mark that was yesterday. Joining us now,
[00:10] it doesn't feel like it's up $2,000.
[00:12] Anthony Pompiano, founder and CEO of
[00:14] Professional Capital Management. It kind
[00:16] of slowly just uh has been selling off
[00:20] for about 3 weeks, I think. And last
[00:23] week it got worse. Broke under 105 all
[00:26] the way down to 99. you're I mean I know
[00:30] what you're going to say. Um when when
[00:32] there's u things like this going on,
[00:34] people sell what they're able to sell
[00:36] and it's pretty it's pretty liquid.
[00:38] Yeah. Look, I think that over the
[00:39] weekend, we've now seen throughout this
[00:40] year multiple geopolitical events have
[00:42] transpired on Saturday or Sunday. Uh the
[00:44] traditional markets are closed. Bitcoin
[00:46] is 24/7 global and liquid and so people
[00:48] do sell uh what they want to sell. Now
[00:50] we see that stocks are down this morning
[00:52] and I think that many assets will get
[00:53] sold when people are able to sell those
[00:55] as well. Uh but also I think that a core
[00:57] function of Bitcoin is not only the
[01:00] accessibility but it is the volatility
[01:02] and what you're seeing here is that
[01:03] people are reacting whether it's
[01:04] positive or negative. Bitcoin just moves
[01:06] more and ultimately if you look over the
[01:08] last 90 days Bitcoin's up 15% and it's
[01:10] up over 50% in the last year. So I think
[01:12] Bitcoin investors are very happy that
[01:14] they're continuing to see volatility. I
[01:15] just think that the the overriding theme
[01:19] of the past two months though has been
[01:21] uh cool inflation and more dovish
[01:25] comments coming at least from some
[01:27] members of the Fed. That's that's what
[01:29] Bitcoin wants, isn't it? I mean, a rate
[01:31] cut, rate cuts, uh QE,
[01:35] um anything that that increases the
[01:38] number of dollars out there. The big
[01:39] beautiful bill is going to add how much?
[01:42] I mean, all these things seem like they
[01:43] they're playing right into Bitcoin's um
[01:46] wheelhouse.
[01:48] It's up. It was up to 110,000 from where
[01:51] was it at 17 what 2 years ago or 17,000?
[01:54] It wasn't that long ago. So, it's come a
[01:56] long way, but it is and and you can't
[01:58] look at it the way I'm looking at it.
 If
[02:00] you think about uh that volatility,
[02:02] Bitcoin was down, you know, 757 $76,000
[02:04] just a few weeks ago. We're back up over
[02:06] $100,000. And so again, it's the
[02:08] volatility of Bitcoin is what is
[02:10] attractive to a very large uh audience
[02:12] uh of those holders, but also I think
[02:14] that the uh large pools of capital now
[02:16] realize that it is big enough for them
[02:18] to allocate to. And that's where you're
[02:20] really seeing uh kind of this adoption
[02:22] both on Wall Street and at the nation
[02:23] state level. And I think that's only
[02:24] going to continue
 and that's going to be
[02:27] for the original reason and that is as
[02:30] an alternative to fiat and there's only
[02:33] 21 million because stable coins
[02:35] based on the dollar if they're real and
[02:39] have 102%
[02:41] backing with treasuries or however they
[02:43] want to do it that could seems like you
[02:46] know bas put it on Ethereum or whatever
[02:48] you you put it on that could take the
[02:50] usage case uh away from from being a big
[02:55] benefit for Bitcoin, couldn't it? Could
[02:57] it would would I if Bitcoin was stable,
[02:59] would stay get up, let's say it gets up
[03:01] to a million dollars a coin, which I'm
[03:03] just
 Well, Bitcoin is stable. Bitcoin is
[03:05] stable, right? One Bitcoin equals one
[03:07] Bitcoin. And I think what you're saying
[03:08] is the Bitcoin,
 but you don't want to
[03:10] use it necessarily. You don't want to
[03:11] buy a pizza that's worth a trillion
[03:13] dollars in 10 years. So, it's not being
[03:15] used for that yet. You could use stable
[03:17] coins the same way, couldn't you?
 Yeah.
[03:18] Yeah. Well, I think what people are
[03:19] doing is they're saying, "I want to hold
[03:20] the things that'll be valuable in the
[03:21] future, and I want to get rid of the
[03:22] things that aren't going to be valuable
[03:23] in the future." So, they're spending,
[03:25] they're literally selling the stable
[03:26] coin. They're saying it's not going to
[03:27] be valuable in the future, and they're
[03:29] saving and holding the thing that's
[03:30] going to appreciate in value, which is
[03:31] Bitcoin.
 Okay. So, those those are
[03:33] different usages then for Bitcoin.
[03:35] Bitcoin ever become the the way that
[03:38] transactions are done around the globe
[03:39] instantaneously?
 People already do that
[03:41] to some degree. I think it'll continue
[03:42] to become more and more popular. The
[03:44] question is if in a stable coin world,
[03:46] does it erode the value of Bitcoin in
[03:48] that regard? Meaning to the extent that
[03:49] people want to be able to move money
[03:50] from place to place to place.
 Yeah.
[03:52] Well, I think
 that's part of the
[03:54] argument about what Bitcoin is able to
[03:55] do.
 I think right now we still live in a
[03:56] dollar denominated world and so people
[03:58] are pricing the assets in dollars and so
[04:00] people are going to spend the dollars to
[04:01] buy those goods. uh as you see more and
[04:03] more organizations start to price things
[04:04] in Bitcoin which is a big if but if that
[04:06] happens then you will see Bitcoin become
[04:08] the medium of exchange because now what
[04:09] you're doing is you're taking away that
[04:11] exchange rate or that volatility in
[04:12] dollar prices.
 Okay, different question
[04:14] just about your own life. Yeah.
 So
[04:16] you're going to have now the Pompiano uh
[04:18] sort of u empire between the spa which
[04:22] you're working on between this effort
[04:24] between your media efforts all how is it
[04:27] how are you going to devote yourself to
[04:29] these different activities? Well, today
[04:31] we're announcing what is the largest
[04:32] initial uh fund raise for a uh publicly
[04:35] traded Bitcoin treasury company in
[04:37] history. Uh we've raised over $750
[04:38] million. Uh it's a billion dollar merger
[04:40] with the Columbus Circle Spa. Um and the
[04:44] idea here is uh we want to really be
[04:47] successful in the financial services
[04:48] sector. And so if you think about uh
[04:50] this Procap SPAC, that is a dollar
[04:52] denominated vehicle to go and do an
[04:54] acquisition. Uh the Procap Financial is
[04:57] the exact same thing. is a publicly
[04:58] traded company where we can go and we
[05:00] can acquire Bitcoin. And so I think that
[05:02] that is where my entire career has sat.
[05:04] I sit at the intersection between the
[05:06] internet and the Bitcoiners and the
[05:07] institutional world. We've been very uh
[05:09] fortunate to have a lot of institutional
[05:10] investors participate in this round but
[05:12] also I think that there is a dollar
[05:14] denominated world and there's a bitcoin
[05:15] denominated world. And what I want to do
[05:16] is continue to sit at the intersection
[05:18] of that and provide ability not only for
[05:20] myself and our shareholders. operating
[05:22] that these businesses in I mean are you
[05:24] are you the effectively the CEO
[05:25] operating them or are you going to have
[05:27] teams that are doing this for you? How's
[05:28] this going to work?
 Uh some some of the
[05:30] different vehicles obviously we will
[05:31] hire entire dedicated teams in the
[05:33] private market. That's what we've done.
[05:34] We own a lot of businesses. We have you
[05:35] know CEOs and executive teams that run
[05:37] those businesses. Uh I will be the CEO
[05:39] of Procap Financial uh which is the
[05:41] business combination uh with Columbus
[05:42] Circle. And what I believe is the
[05:44] opportunity there is you're able to
[05:46] acquire Bitcoin, but then not only just
[05:49] acquire Bitcoin, buying Bitcoin and
[05:50] allowing it to go up in price obviously
[05:52] has been a successful strategy, but I
[05:54] believe that the future of these
[05:55] companies is going to be how do you
[05:57] build revenue and profit? The financial
[05:59] services on top of that. No different
[06:00] than if you look at the traditional
[06:01] financial service firms, they have a
[06:03] balance sheet of dollars and they go and
[06:04] they build these financial services on
[06:05] top that drive revenue and profit. I
[06:07] think that you still have to build a
[06:08] business on top of a big pile of
[06:10] Bitcoin.
[06:11] Very good. All right, pump. Thank you.
[06:14] Absolutely. Thank you guys for having
[06:15] me.
 Okay.
