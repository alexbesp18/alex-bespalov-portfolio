[00:00] What's going on guys? Today we got a
[00:01] great conversation with Paulina
[00:02] Pompiano. In this conversation we talk
[00:04] about what's going on with Bitcoin, the
[00:05] Bitcoin treasury companies, how Iran and
[00:08] Israel and all of the geopolitical
[00:10] conflict, how that's impacting your
[00:11] portfolio and the price of Bitcoin. On
[00:13] top of that, we also get into what's
[00:15] going on in the stock market, why
[00:16] investors now like Bitcoin, the fact
[00:18] that the volatility is going down, not
[00:20] up, and then Pla gives a little bit of
[00:21] behind the scenes what happened over the
[00:24] weekend before we announced the deal in
[00:25] the public markets. Hope you guys enjoy
[00:27] this conversation with Plina Pompiano.
[00:29] All right, Plina, what's the first topic
[00:30] you got?
 All right, let's talk
[00:32] geopolitics. Bitcoin's price dropped
[00:35] below a 100,000 as the US, you know,
[00:38] bombed some nuclear bases in Iran on
[00:40] Saturday. Yep. However, it is now, I
[00:44] just checked at back at 105,000.
[00:47] Doesn't matter.
 So, so how should
[00:48] investors just in general view these
[00:52] constantly volatile geopolitical events?
[00:55] Well, I think the first thing is you got
[00:56] to remember that geopolitical events
[00:58] like this are a surprise by design. So,
[01:01] there's now reports coming out the
[01:02] United States sent some B-52s to Guam.
[01:05] Everyone's like, "Oh, where are the
[01:06] B-52s? Let's look. They're going west."
[01:08] At the same time, the US from Missouri
[01:10] sent nine B-52s east. No one saw it
[01:13] coming. They got in. They dropped the
[01:15] bombs and they got out. No shots fired
[01:17] at US servicemen uh and women, which is
[01:20] uh incredible feat. uh 37 hours if I
[01:23] remember correctly uh flight. Now why is
[01:25] that important? It surprises the enemy.
[01:27] It surprises the American people. It
[01:29] surprises the investor. So the surprise
[01:32] factor immediately people it's like the
[01:34] ground starts shaking in earthquake.
[01:35] You're like wait what's going on? Let me
[01:36] just get my bearings. So what do you do?
[01:39] That uncertainty leads to a quick degree
[01:42] of fear. If you fear what do you do?
[01:44] Sell. Sell. Sell. And so you see
[01:46] algorithms and humans both sell. Now
[01:49] this happened over the weekend though.
[01:51] you can't go sell your stocks, you can't
[01:53] sell a lot of these assets because the
[01:54] hours of operations of the traditional
[01:55] exchanges. So naturally, what you get is
[01:57] you get a big selloff in things like
[01:59] Bitcoin etc. as I predicted over the
[02:03] weekend is that it will come right back
[02:05] because ultimately it is a shock uh
[02:08] factor. So you see it go down and then
[02:10] it goes back up. And so what people I
[02:12] think have realized is hey everything is
[02:13] good. Everything's going to be fine. Now
[02:15] of course they did announce a ceasefire
[02:16] which is helping the assets recover as
[02:18] well. And we saw stocks go down on
[02:20] Monday. We saw other assets go down. So
[02:22] it is really just people in response.
[02:24] They didn't have anything else they
[02:25] could sell. So if you want to raise
[02:26] dollars, if you're worried, what do you
[02:28] do? You sell in almost like a panic,
[02:30] emotional response to the news and
[02:33] therefore you lose money. I mean that's
[02:34] what happened, right? Is if you were
[02:35] selling at 100 and now it's at 105. That
[02:38] wasn't smart. And so I just think that
[02:39] is the general thing. We've seen this
[02:41] happen before uh with a lot of the
[02:42] Middle East conflict. Uh when Iran shot
[02:45] I think it was like 300 missiles at
[02:47] Israel. Then same thing happened.
[02:49] Bitcoin sold off and then it came back.
[02:50] And so it goes back to this idea that
[02:53] the people who tend to do best in the
[02:54] market are the people who lose their
[02:57] passwords. Just chill. Stop looking at
[03:00] the chart. If you're spending your
[03:02] Saturday staring at a chart, we got a
[03:05] whole another conversation we got to
[03:07] have. Instead, understand the asset that
[03:09] you own. Because if you bought Bitcoin
[03:12] and then all of a sudden Iran, Israel,
[03:16] and the United States start dropping
[03:17] bombs on each other and you're selling
[03:19] your Bitcoin, you don't understand what
[03:21] you own. And so it comes back to this
[03:23] idea that you have a asset that is
[03:25] decentralized, that is censorship
[03:27] resistant, that cannot be seized, and it
[03:30] provides sovereignty for individuals,
[03:32] companies, financial institutions, and
[03:34] countries. the more uncertainty, the
[03:37] more chaos, the more that we get towards
[03:39] this like fourth turning, the more
[03:42] valuable Bitcoin is going to be. And so
[03:44] to me, that is ultimately what we saw is
[03:46] we saw an uneducated emotional response.
[03:48] Bitcoin sells off, comes right back,
[03:50] everyone chill out, you're fine. If you
[03:52] went to sleep on Friday, you woke up on
[03:54] Monday, you don't even really know what
[03:56] happened, right? And that's the way that
[03:57] it should be is just keep a long time
[03:59] horizon. Bitcoin is not supposed to be a
[04:01] speculative tool. Yes, people do
[04:03] speculate with it, but ultimately
[04:04] Bitcoin is to be held for decades. And
[04:07] if you do that, that tends to be in a
[04:08] much better position.
 Okay. Um, let's
[04:11] talk about how actually volatility
[04:16] with Bitcoin has kind of cooled and
[04:19] Bitcoin has become more central to
[04:21] people's portfolios. CO2 um the
[04:25] investment firm. It has this in list of
[04:29] the largest 40 tech quote unquote
[04:31] companies by 2030 and and it ranks it by
[04:36] uh 2030 market cap. Bitcoin, Ethereum,
[04:39] Revolute, and Apploven made the list and
[04:43] there's no Apple or Google. What do we
[04:45] think?
 I don't know about all the other
[04:46] ones. I'll talk about Bitcoin. Um with
[04:47] Bitcoin I I think that there's this
[04:49] concept of uh what what is the child
[04:52] story like not too hot not too cold is
[04:54] just right.
 Goldilocks.
 Goldilocks. So
[04:56] you can say that basically Bitcoin has
[04:58] now entered the Goldilocks of
[05:00] volatility. And what I mean by that is
[05:02] Bitcoin when it is a 150 vol asset
[05:06] institutions can't hold that. They can't
[05:08] see something go up thousands of percent
[05:10] and then drop 90%. Right? It's just it's
[05:13] too volatile. Bitcoin also is not that
[05:16] interesting to people if it only goes up
[05:17] 2 or 3% a year, right? So, what you need
[05:20] is you need a higher degree of
[05:21] volatility than you could otherwise get
[05:22] in treasuries or stocks, but you need a
[05:25] low enough volatility where institutions
[05:26] can wrap their head around it. And
[05:28] Bitcoin has now entered into that area.
[05:30] Bitcoin over the last 5 years, the uh
[05:32] compound growth rate is somewhere around
[05:34] 60 65%. That's very attractive. The best
[05:37] hedge fund in history, RENCE, that is
[05:39] what they returned. So you now have
[05:41] entered right just think of as
[05:43] volatility has fallen or as the compound
[05:44] growth rate has fallen you now are
[05:46] entering a zone where the absolute best
[05:48] hedge fund in history is. So that
[05:50] crossover is pretty important because
[05:52] now it is fathomable to people. They're
[05:54] like okay 60% that's high but I at least
[05:57] have seen something like that before. If
[05:59] you show up and you're like yeah
[06:00] compound growth rate is 240%. The fact
[06:02] that it's such a high percentage they
[06:04] deem it's risky and therefore they won't
[06:06] put in their portfolio. I mean you were
[06:08] talking to institutions back in what
[06:10] 2018 2019. Um
[06:14] do you remember their reaction because
[06:17] it was very volatile then?
 Well I think
[06:19] the institutions that I was fortunate
[06:21] enough to work with um who backed those
[06:23] funds one of the things they liked about
[06:25] the structure that we created is that we
[06:26] put Bitcoin inside of a venture fund.
[06:28] Now why do they like that? Because to
[06:30] them they were only getting quarterly
[06:32] marks. So four times a year they would
[06:34] be updated on what the whole portfolio
[06:36] was worth. So the private companies plus
[06:38] Bitcoin. If we had gone to them and
[06:39] said, "Hey, we're going to buy Bitcoin
[06:40] and every week, every month, every, you
[06:43] know, quarter, we're going to give you
[06:44] these updates on just Bitcoin's price.
[06:46] And sometimes it's going to be up
[06:47] hundreds of percent, sometimes it's
[06:48] going to be down 50%." They're like, "We
[06:50] can't put that in our portfolio. It's
[06:51] too volatile." So the way that we were
[06:53] able to get Bitcoin into some of the
[06:55] portfolios of these organizations was we
[06:57] basically put a wrapper around it that
[06:59] was able to offiscate the actual
[07:02] volatility of Bitcoin.
 Say that word
[07:03] again. No, I said how do you say it?
[07:06] Obfiscate. I I don't I don't think I've
[07:08] ever heard you use
 Yeah, that's a word.
[07:10] Hide it. You know, hide it behind the
[07:11] curtain.
 I know. I know what it means.
[07:12] Yeah. Okay. Well, I'm just saying this.
[07:14] Wow. That hit me with obfiscate.
 Yeah.
[07:16] Well, I'm trying to teach my children
[07:17] how to read, write, listen, talk. You
[07:19] know, I got to start.
 I might start
[07:21] reading the dictionary to up my
[07:23] vocabulary so that I can help them.
 Just
[07:25] just very quick. One time I this was
[07:28] years ago I didn't know that Anthony had
[07:31] a v much of a vocabulary if at all and
[07:34] he was he was on I just meant like you
[07:37] use simple words which I appreciated.
 So
[07:41] he was on the phone. I'm doing my work
[07:42] and he's pacing back and forth doing his
[07:44] phone call and all of a sudden I heard
[07:47] it would behoove you.
 It would behoove
[07:49] that person. Where did you pull that out
[07:52] from?
 Yeah. Listen, that when you have
[07:54] the intelligence level of me, when
[07:56] you're in high school, one of the things
[07:58] that you can do is you can really not
[08:01] care a lot. And if every once in a while
[08:02] you pull a word out that people are
[08:04] like, don't expect you to have
[08:06] now. They're on their toes. They're
[08:08] like, "Wait a second. This kid, where
[08:10] did behoove come from? Where did these
[08:11] words come from?" Because now they don't
[08:13] know. They can't put you in a box. So, I
[08:15] got to say the tricks.
 I am bewildered
[08:18] by this.
 Okay. Well, the whole idea is
[08:20] that you can put it inside of a
[08:21] structure and you can hide the
[08:23] volatility. Now, what's starting to
[08:24] happen though is investors are saying,
[08:26] "Wait, the volatility is at a level that
[08:27] I actually want my portfolio. I want it
[08:28] to outperform uh my traditional assets
[08:31] and I can wrap my head around it." So,
[08:33] they understand Bitcoin better. They
[08:34] understand what the volatility is and
[08:36] they see the trend. We have the uh
[08:37] benefit of time. The compound annual
[08:39] growth rate is coming down. So, you know
[08:41] that hey, today it's at 60 over the last
[08:43] 5 years. 5 years from now or 10 years
[08:46] from now, maybe it's at 30 or 40. Maybe
[08:48] it's at 20, right? Whatever the number
[08:49] is, it's going down, but you want to be
[08:51] able to capitalize that because it still
[08:52] outperforms your uh regular portfolio.
[08:54] And so I think that is really this idea
[08:56] that CO2 is talking about where they're
[08:57] like, okay, now investors are starting
[08:58] to put Bitcoin into the portfolio
[09:00] because the volatility has cooled. And
[09:02] so yes, individuals, the reason why they
[09:04] were uh attracted to Bitcoin and why
[09:06] most of the people watching or listening
[09:07] to this front ran all the institutions
[09:10] and countries is because you wanted max
[09:12] volatility. You actually did not want
[09:14] the volatility to cool. you wanted up
[09:17] a,000% down 80 up a,000% down 80 you're
[09:20] cool with that the institutions are not
[09:22] and so now the volatility has come down
[09:25] that's why you see individuals I
[09:27] wouldn't do it but other individuals
[09:29] basically push way out on the risk curve
[09:31] in crypto they're saying okay well this
[09:32] Bitcoin thing that doesn't move as much
[09:34] as fortcoin or whatever other coin I'm
[09:36] looking for max volatility let me go to
[09:39] you know shitcoin land right and so
[09:41] again it goes back to what is somebody
[09:43] trying to optimize for the institutions
[09:45] are not optimizing solely for upside
[09:47] volatility. What they are optimizing for
[09:48] is uh kind of a well-rounded asset. They
[09:51] want something that has some degree of
[09:53] asymmetry, but also they want a thing
[09:54] that's not going to go down 80%. They
[09:56] want something that is resilient. They
[09:57] want something that now is starting to
[09:59] check all these boxes that Bitcoin
[10:00] brings to the table. They put in the
[10:02] portfolio and sharp ratio goes up. they
[10:04] actually get some non-correlation or
[10:06] lower correlation between their assets
[10:07] in their portfolio and they still have a
[10:10] high enough degree of upside in Bitcoin
[10:12] that it outperforms some of the other
[10:14] assets and that makes it attractive.
[10:15] Perfect. Um, let's talk about stable
[10:18] coins. Okay,
 so on CNBC on Monday, you
[10:22] said people want to spend stable coins
[10:23] because they will be less valuable in
[10:25] the future, but they want to save
[10:27] Bitcoin because it will appreciate over
[10:29] time. Circle stock has raised 600% since
[10:32] its IPO and the US Senate passed crypto
[10:35] legislation called the Genius Act last
[10:38] week, giving crypto industry the first
[10:40] major major legislative win. Trump urged
[10:43] the House to pass it. He says this is
[10:45] American brilli brilliance at its best
[10:48] and we're going to show the world how to
[10:49] win with digital assets like never
[10:51] before. Just really quick before we get
[10:52] into it, can I just shout out our
[10:54] producer Matt Merlinsky for these
[10:56] topics? He does great research. I'm just

 Pina is
[11:10] uh getting paid in bagels or something.
[11:12] All right, so uh stable coins are um
[11:15] stable coins are hilarious to me. The
[11:17] great paradox of stable coins is they're
[11:20] incredibly important and they don't
[11:21] matter at all. Today's episode is

[12:46] crypto. Explore how you can access it
[12:48] best with Bitwise. And always, of
[12:50] course, carefully consider the extreme
[12:52] risks associated with crypto. They're
[12:54] incredibly important and they don't
[12:55] matter at all. Same thing at the same
[12:58] time, right? Why do I say that? They're
[12:59] incredibly important because they are
[13:02] the way that many of these traditional
[13:04] financial institutions, politicians, uh,
[13:07] emerging markets, they're all getting
[13:08] onboarded to this new digital world.
[13:10] They don't matter at the same time
[13:12] because they're just dollars. Dollars
[13:13] have existed for years, right? It's not
[13:15] some new crazy thing. And so,
 is it just
[13:18] like a digital do? I'm trying to
[13:19] understand.
 Best way to think about it,
[13:21] if I ask you, give me $1 of physical
[13:24] cash. You're going to hand it to me. If
[13:25] I say to you, send me a dollar on Venmo
[13:29] or from your bank, you still send me a
[13:31] dollar. Whether you handed it to me
[13:32] physically or what I would call an
[13:34] electronic dollar,
 I probably pay some
[13:36] in fees. So, it's not
 possibly, but it's
[13:39] still $1. It's just in a different form
[13:41] factor. A stable coin is now just
[13:43] another form factor which is a digital
[13:46] token on a blockchain that represents
[13:48] that same dollar. So whether it's
[13:49] physical, electronic or digital, it's
[13:51] still $1.
 And what it's backed by my
[13:53] like digital dollar, my physical
 the
[13:56] dollar that is on the blockchain is
[13:57] backed by US treasuries.
 Okay?
 So they
[13:59] sit there, you can go, you can get them
[14:01] back, right? It it's got the value
[14:03] behind it. And so the whole idea again
[14:05] is they're important because they're
[14:07] onboarding people to the digital world.
[14:08] It now is an ability for you to move
[14:10] without hours of operations, low cost
[14:12] anywhere in the world, immediate, etc.
[14:14] So basically, the dollar gets more
[14:16] utility,
[14:18] but it doesn't matter because it's just
[14:19] the dollar. So you're opening access,
[14:22] you're improving the usage of the
[14:23] dollar,
 but ultimately the actual asset
[14:25] itself is just $1.
 Wait, and just really
[14:27] quick, why
[14:29] why is it different from just sending a
[14:31] digital dollar? If I want to send money
[14:32] to Bulgaria right now, I can do it via
[14:34] like PayPal. Why is that different?
[14:37] Maybe,
 maybe
 it depends on what the
[14:40] country is. It depends on when you send
[14:41] it. It depends on what the fees are. I
[14:42] mean, there's a lot of stuff in there,
[14:43] right? So, for example, let's say that
[14:45] on the weekend I may or may not have
[14:48] recently been involved in a transaction
[14:49] where people had to send wires. Well,
[14:51] the wires don't actually get sent till
[14:53] the weekdays.
 Oh, okay.
 And so, there's
[14:55] hours of operations, right? Everyone has
[14:57] had the experience in business that they
[14:59] got to get to the bank or get online and
[15:01] send the wire before 2 p.m., right? You
[15:03] know, there's all these things that
[15:04] happen that again are are somewhat
[15:06] antiquated. If you move all of the money
[15:08] into a digital token that now can just
[15:10] move freely at any time for no cost uh
[15:14] to anyone. Now, what you're doing is
[15:16] you're opening access. You're reducing
[15:18] friction. There should be more velocity
[15:20] of money in the system. That's
[15:22] ultimately good for economies and for
[15:23] individuals.
 Do the banks like this?
[15:25] Well, the banks don't like it if they
[15:27] can't participate.
 Are they
[15:28] participating? So when Tether and Circle
[15:32] are out there having a field day,
 right,
[15:34] and the banks are sitting on the
[15:35] sidelines cuz they can't touch crypto,
[15:37] the banks are advocating. They're saying
[15:38] we should create rules. This is
[15:39] nonsense, yada yada, whatever.
 But
[15:41] recently, two things happened. Uh, one,
[15:44] the banks who have been very clearly say
[15:45] if they we get the green light, we
[15:47] definitely jumping in the stable coin
[15:48] game. JP Morgan came out. They
[15:49] announced, I think it was called the J
[15:51] uh JPMD, I think is what they called it,
[15:53] which is like a their version of a
[15:55] stable coin. A little bit some changes
[15:57] they made, but it's their version. Bank
[15:59] of America, uh, Brian Moyahan, uh, he
[16:01] said that, uh, they're going to get in
[16:02] the game if they get the approval. And
[16:04] then the bank, uh, regulators just came
[16:06] out and they said that they are now
[16:08] going to reduce or remove this idea of
[16:11] reputational risk to a bank if they
[16:13] participate or touch things that are in
[16:15] crypto. So what used to happen is if a
[16:17] bank, Signature, Silvergate, etc. if
[16:21] they were doing anything that had crypto
[16:23] relation uh relationship, they would
[16:25] actually get dinged by the regulator and
[16:27] they would say, "Well, that that's
[16:28] reputational risk." There's issues
[16:29] there. Now, the regulators are saying,
[16:31] "We're not going to assign that to you
[16:32] if you participate in this industry."
[16:34] Uh, which is kind of a a big moment
[16:36] because now it again is one step closer
[16:37] to the banks participating. And so, the
[16:39] banks are also rumored to be talking
[16:40] about, should they come together? Should
[16:42] we get a little uh oligopoly? You didn't
[16:44] think I knew that word, right? I did not
[16:46] think. On top of that, uh maybe they'll
[16:49] create a little consortium. You didn't
[16:50] know I knew I that word, right? God.
 Um
[16:52] and so as they create a partnership on
[16:55] Wall Street, uh maybe what they will do
[16:57] is they will create a stable coin that
[16:59] all the banks will use. And their idea
[17:01] is that they have a network effect.
[17:02] They've got a walled garden. They'll go
[17:03] to their customers and say, "Use our
[17:05] products." Now,
[17:07] to all the subscribers of the Pomp
[17:09] letter since like 2018, look it up real
[17:12] quick. Pomplet. and then type uh
[17:14] corporate central bank I think is uh the
[17:17] letter that's big brain right there to
[17:18] remember what I wrote 7 years ago um
[17:22] what is it what year
 no 4 months ago
[17:24] hold on a second
 so my whole thing was
[17:26] JP Morgan tried this one time before
[17:28] they uh type in a JPMC coin uh they
[17:31] launched something called JPMCoin which
[17:32] was a test and what they said is we are
[17:34] going to have our corporate clients use
[17:36] JPMCoin to move money within the bank
[17:38] what year
 uh is this 5 years ago
[17:40] something like that
 Wells Fargo is
[17:41] creating a
 no JP Morgan JP PMcoin. And
[17:44] so when they did that, uh, and when they
[17:46] did that, the whole idea that I said was
[17:48] you have to be careful that they do not
[17:51] launch these things with a dollar
[17:52] backing. And then in the future, they
[17:54] remove the dollar backing and now they
[17:56] can just print coins at will. They
[17:58] basically become a central bank
[17:59] themselves.
 And that's what the US did.
[18:02] The US basically removed the dollar uh
[18:04] the gold backing and they just can now
[18:05] print as many dollars as they want.
[18:07] Every bank on Wall Street would love to
[18:09] be able to do that if they could. So,
[18:11] what I think is going to have to happen
[18:13] here is you're going to have to create a
[18:14] rule that says if you launch a stable
[18:15] coin and you have a backing, let's say
[18:17] 1:1 to the US dollar, you may never
[18:20] remove the backing in the future. You
[18:22] can't onboard a bunch of people with a
[18:24] promise that the coin is backed by
[18:25] something and then in the future remove
[18:27] that backing, change the rules, and now
[18:29] all of a sudden you just have a money
[18:30] printer.
 Is it the corporate central
[18:31] bank playbook?
 Like I said, what year?
[18:34] 2019.
 I was off by one year, six years
[18:36] ago.
 But I'm not
 See, I've been talking
[18:38] about this for half a decade. I just
[18:39] realized I'm not a paying member of the
[18:41] palm plotter so I can't actually read it
[18:44] but I do see the corporate central bank
[18:46] playbook. I'm sure I am on another
[18:49] account.
 You guys want to understand the
[18:50] dynamic between and I she claims to not
[18:53] be a uh uh
 I should be complimentary.
[18:56] Who was the first subscriber of the
[18:58] profile?
 Actually somebody else. You
[18:59] were second. Somebody beat you to it.
[19:01] Remember you were upset.
 I'm still
[19:02] paying for
 years later.
 Why did you Why
[19:06] did you not add me? It's complimentary.
[19:08] It's the least handout, dude. Where's my
[19:09] handouts in this world, man?
 Okay.
 Like
[19:11] a $100.
 Yeah.
 It's like you don't even
[19:14] respect the time, energy, effort I put
[19:16] into creating money big ideas I've been
[19:18] putting in there for a decade. You know
[19:19] how much money people would have made
[19:21] over the last 10 years or whatever. I've
[19:22] been writing that thing.
 Who came up
[19:25] with the idea for that thing?
 What's the
[19:26] next topic?
[19:29] All right. Um All right. So, let's talk
[19:32] about this deal that happened over the
[19:34] weekend. um you launched a Bitcoin
[19:37] treasury company, but more so than that,
[19:41] let's just talk about like this trend of
[19:42] Bitcoin treasury companies. By the way,
[19:44] fun fact, today I woke up um to a
[19:48] message from my family in Bulgaria to an
[19:51] article in Bulgarian about Anthony
[19:53] launching a Bitcoin treasure company. I
[19:54] was like, this thing made its way to
[19:56] Bulgaria.
 It's global. Bitcoin is
[19:58] global. Everyone wants Bitcoin. Do you
[20:00] not see? Everyone wants it. Doesn't
[20:02] matter what language you speak, what
[20:03] religion you're a part of, what your
[20:04] education, your wealth status, where
[20:06] your geography, does not matter.
[20:08] Everyone wants Bitcoin.
 Just explain to
[20:10] me like what is a Bitcoin treasury
[20:12] company?

[21:15] The entire idea is when you capitalize a
[21:17] business,
 yes,
 and let's say in the
[21:19] dollar denominated world, you put
[21:21] dollars onto the balance sheet. Okay.
[21:22] When you put dollars on the balance
[21:23] sheet, then you got to go figure out
[21:25] what are you going to do? Some
[21:26] businesses say uh I'm going to go and
[21:28] I'm going to build uh a piece of
[21:29] hardware. Some say I'm going to build
[21:31] some software. Some people say that I'm
[21:32] going to go and do uh lending or maybe
[21:34] I'll do asset management or whatever the
[21:36] thing is, right? But you seed the
[21:37] business with some dollars and then you
[21:39] have a business that you get into. What
[21:41] the Bitcoin treasury companies
[21:42] essentially have said is whether they
[21:43] already are a company or they're
[21:44] starting a new company, I'm going to put
[21:46] Bitcoin on the balance sheet and then my
[21:48] entire goal is to buy more Bitcoin. Now,
[21:50] what people generally think of as a true
[21:52] Bitcoin treasury company or a pure play
[21:54] Bitcoin treasury company is they
[21:56] essentially are using capital market
[21:58] tools to raise more capital to then go
[22:01] buy more Bitcoin. So, for example, if
[22:03] let's say that uh you put $100 of
[22:05] Bitcoin on the balance sheet of a
[22:07] company and Bitcoin's price goes up,
[22:09] let's say uh 50%, now you have $150
[22:13] worth of Bitcoin. Your share price
[22:15] should be increasing. If your share
[22:16] price is increasing, there's all kinds
[22:18] of capital market tools available to
[22:19] you. What is happening right now with
[22:21] many of these Bitcoin treasury companies
[22:22] is they're trading at a premium to NAV.
[22:24] And there's a lot of debate as to why.
[22:26] Some trade, you know, out NAV, some
[22:28] people trade in some cases as high as 6,
[22:30] 7, 8, nine times NAV, right? Um,
[22:33] obviously, I don't think that's very
[22:34] sustainable. And so there is some sweet
[22:37] spot where what people are essentially
[22:38] in my opinion doing is they are trying
[22:40] to quantify or measure what is the value
[22:44] of the future Bitcoin purchases that are
[22:46] going to occur here. And the way that
[22:47] many people have started to think about
[22:48] this which again I'm not saying whether
[22:50] I agree with this metric or not is
[22:52] something called Bitcoin per share. So
[22:54] if if there's 100 shares and there is
[22:56] 100 Bitcoin on the balance sheet one
[22:57] share equals one Bitcoin. So you have a
[22:59] Bitcoin per share of one. If all of a
[23:02] sudden now you have 110 Bitcoin on the
[23:04] balance sheet and you still only have
[23:06] 100 shares, now you have a Bitcoin per
[23:08] share of 1.1. That's a 10% increase. And
[23:11] therefore, if you keep getting that
[23:12] Bitcoin per share to grow, then people
[23:14] sort of say, "Oh, you know what? If I
[23:15] hold this thing and the Bitcoin per
[23:17] share is going to grow in the future,
[23:18] then I should actually ascribe some
[23:20] future value and therefore it's going to
[23:22] trade it more than NAV." Well, if the
[23:24] stock trades it more than NAV, then
[23:25] people have even more capital market
[23:26] tools available to them. And so I don't
[23:29] think that um the current version of
[23:31] what's happening in the market is going
[23:33] to be the version that happens forever.
[23:35] Uh I do think that there is uh a lot of
[23:38] value whether you are an individual, a
[23:40] company, financial institution or a
[23:42] country in buying Bitcoin and holding
[23:43] it. And I think that now what we are
[23:45] seeing is we are seeing the intersection
[23:47] of Bitcoin and traditional markets. And
[23:49] as those two things come together, there
[23:51] will be new ways that people can start
[23:53] to do things that they otherwise weren't
[23:54] doing a decade ago. M
 um how that plays
[23:57] out, we'll see obviously given the uh
[23:59] the deal that we announced. Um there's
[24:01] not a lot that I can say uh in terms of
[24:03] our specific strategy. People can go
[24:05] look at the public documentation. People
[24:06] can look at the the press releases. Uh
[24:08] but I do think that there is something
[24:09] very interesting happening in this
[24:10] space. Uh I can analyze what's already
[24:13] occurring. I've got ideas as to how this
[24:16] will play out and uh rather than be like
[24:18] a Monday morning quarterback sitting
[24:20] here critiquing everybody else, you
[24:21] know, in uh the words of uh Chimath
[24:24] Palpatia, like let's jump in the arena.
[24:27] Well, I can talk about the deal because
[24:30] I was there. Um
 don't talk about
[24:33] details.
 No,
[24:35] I can talk about behind the scenes of
[24:37] the deal because I was there. But
[24:39] anyway, so so basically I just want to
[24:42] say that you may imagine Anthony, you
[24:44] know, doing a deal behind the desk
[24:46] calling people. No, that's not what
[24:48] happened. What happened was I said like
[24:51] a great wife months ago. Let's go on
[24:55] this nice trip in the woods in a
[24:57] mountain upstate New York
 to celebrate
[24:58] our wedding.
 To celebrate our wedding,
[25:00] which isn't a month, but still like I
[25:02] was like,
 you see how this works? Like
[25:03] not we're not even in the same month of
[25:05] the wedding, but
 So not only was it a
[25:06] nice trip, it was an anniversary trip.
[25:08] Well, it also happened to coincide it
[25:11] being the weekend before this deal
[25:13] closed. So, I'd be like, "Hey, let's go
[25:16] on a nice walk in the woods." And then
[25:20] Anony's on a call with someone trying to
[25:23] figure something out. We're walking in
[25:24] the woods. Bam, he loses service. Got to
[25:27] go back. Then, bam, there's a porcupine
[25:30] walking in front of us.
[25:32] You ever been on a call with 25, 30
[25:34] people and you lose service in the woods
[25:37] and you have Listen, gentlemen,
[25:41] this is a very precarious, you know, I
[25:43] think I know that word precarious
[25:44] situation. On one hand, you're very
[25:47] frustrated. The phone call start, you
[25:49] know, you start to get the the
[25:50] disruption of the phone call. You you
[25:52] just like, damn, can't I just sit
[25:53] inside? I can do the phone call. It's
[25:55] important.
 On the other hand, you got
[25:57] your beautiful, caring, amazing wife.
[25:59] Can you find a better word than
 trying
[26:01] to walk in uh in the woods?
 And so you
[26:04] know what you do?
[26:06] You say
[26:08] sweetie.
 You've never used that word
[26:11] ever in your life. When have you ever
[26:14] called me sweet honey?
 What have you
[26:16] ever called
 whatever word y'all use?
 Why
[26:19] don't we walk over here and you do the
[26:20] old like
 No, I got a yoke.
 Arm around.
[26:23] Arm around and then you guide her back
[26:25] towards soul service. I got to.
 And as
[26:28] you guide her back towards cell service,
[26:29] you may comment on the fauna. She
[26:32] doesn't think I know that word
 on the
[26:35] tree top maybe on the animals, the
[26:39] reptiles, you know, all anything going
[26:42] on around you. Call out maybe that there
[26:44] might be dog poop on the ground, you
[26:46] know, be like the white knight, the
[26:47] chivalry.
 Was actually horse, but okay.
[26:49] Make sure that she doesn't step in that,
[26:51] you know, just be a good guy. But you
[26:53] guide her back towards the salsa
[26:56] so that you can continue your call. On
[26:58] top of that,
[27:01] if you ever are working on something, I
[27:03] just tell people I was up uh on Monday
[27:05] night until like 1:30, 2:00 in the
[27:07] morning, then I had to be back up again
[27:08] at like 5. So, I was, you know, doing
[27:11] doing what I had to do. And if you ever
[27:13] get a text message from your wife while
[27:16] you're up on calls with a lot of people
[27:18] and she says, "Hey, are you going to
[27:21] come to sleep soon?"
[27:24] Another thing you can do, just use the
[27:27] thumbs up.
 What?
 The thumbs up is the
[27:30] man's greatest friend in a text message
[27:33] with their wives.
 Uh, you know why?
 No,
[27:35] I would not endorse
 because it's just
[27:37] enough. It's just enough where you
[27:38] acknowledge it, but it doesn't give any
[27:40] information. And it just upsets her
[27:43] enough where she's probably thinking
[27:44] like, "Am I gonna go off on this guy
[27:47] right now, but it's not so abrasive that
[27:49] she actually can attack you?" Because it
[27:52] can be interpreted a lot of different
[27:53] ways.
 And so if you use the thumbs up,
[27:56] this is such bad advice.
 It's like, "I
[27:58] acknowledge you. I was being kind. I was
[28:00] thinking, you know, I I could have not
[28:01] responded. I was on a call." Like, but
[28:03] also she knows that you're basically not
[28:05] answering. is a polite non-answer. It's
[28:07] thumbs up. And so that's what I did.
[28:10] Narrator, she did not go to sleep at
[28:12] 1:30 in the morning.
 I gave her the
[28:13] thumbs up and then didn't go to sleep.
[28:17] So yes, uh the behind the scenes of a
[28:19] lot of this stuff is uh a little crazy.
[28:21] Shocking. We survived this weekend, but
[28:23] we survived. We are here today.
 Yeah, I
[28:26] told Pl she a real one, 100%. She she uh
[28:29] she knows the life that she signed up
[28:31] for and uh we we've uh we've been
[28:34] through all kinds of great stuff
[28:35] together in terms of uh different deals
[28:38] and different things. Um and uh as you
[28:40] could tell, she's still asking me what a
[28:42] Bitcoin treasury company is. So,
 I'm
[28:44] just saying
[28:46] I don't know how much paying attention
[28:47] she was doing all week.
 I was I was out
[28:50] sunbathing while you were inside
[28:53] like a gremlin.
 Yeah. She did say to me
[28:55] at one point, "If you don't see the sun
[28:56] outside, doesn't count that you went." I
[28:58] literally I literally pulled up some
[28:59] research. I was like, "20 minutes in the
[29:01] sun in sunlight boosts your vitamin D."
[29:04] He was like, "Uhhuh."
[29:07] Anyway,
 you know what, boys? We got it
[29:09] done, though. All right. What else you
[29:10] got? Anything else? That's all I got.
[29:11] That's it. All right. Thank you guys
[29:12] very much for watching. We'll talk to
[29:14] you guys next week.
