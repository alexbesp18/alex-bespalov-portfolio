[00:00] If we're in a world that is moving so
[00:01] fast that there isn't a company to go
[00:03] work at in a desk and you're working
[00:05] remotely and you're moving from place to
[00:07] place and travel and leisure becomes
[00:08] part of your life, I think younger
[00:10] people are better prepared for that. So
[00:12] I think socialism is just the next point
[00:15] of the capitalism side and the more
[00:17] people are angry, the more money the
[00:19] government has to print, that's why the
[00:20] transfer payments are going up and
[00:22] that's why at the end Bitcoin will not
[00:24] stop going higher regardless of what
[00:26] people say. It will replace a lot of the
[00:28] fiat assets over time.
 What's going on,
[00:31] guys? We got a great episode today with
[00:33] Jordy Visser. As you guys know, he's a
[00:35] fan favorite, but he's also a 30-year
[00:37] expert on Wall Street. And we get into
[00:39] everything going on in the world. Why AI
[00:41] is accelerating, why stocks, Bitcoin,
[00:43] gold, everything's hitting new all-time
[00:45] highs. Why Salesforce is all of a sudden
[00:47] in the AI conversation. How you sitting
[00:49] at home can change your portfolio to
[00:51] benefit from artificial intelligence,
[00:53] energy and power generation, Bitcoin,
[00:55] and much, much more. And we even talk
[00:57] about why somebody like Mum Donnie, who
[00:59] is actually possibly going to be the
[01:01] mayor of New York City, what it means
[01:03] for demographics, thought process about
[01:05] capitalism and socialism, and how you
[01:08] sitting at home can navigate all the
[01:10] volatility, uncertainty, and chaos. This
[01:12] conversation was awesome. I learned a
[01:14] lot. I think you will, too. Here's my
[01:15] latest conversation with Jordi Visser.
[01:17] Jordy, the prophecy has been fulfilled.
[01:20] Bitcoin new all-time high, gold new
[01:22] all-time high, NASDAQ new all-time high,
[01:24] and now S&P 500 new all-time high. The
[01:28] bears are crying. You have been talking
[01:30] about this for a while now. Why are all
[01:33] the asset prices hitting all-time highs
[01:35] after everyone back in April thought
[01:36] that the world was ending?
 Well, you you
[01:40] predicted it, too. So, um I I don't
[01:43] think either of us thought it would
[01:44] happen in a matter of weeks after what
[01:46] we went through in uh in the days post
[01:50] liberation, but uh I I don't think
[01:53] people have fully uh capitulated yet. I
[01:56] think they've uh you know, people that
[01:58] are managing money have had to
[02:00] capitulate because they can't
[02:01] underperform.
[02:03] Uh but there's still a scramble going on
[02:05] and the scramble is now related to okay,
[02:07] what's been driving this? what has
[02:09] driven it and what continues to be the
[02:11] theme that I think people are having a
[02:12] hard time with is artificial
[02:14] intelligence. Uh that's been the driving
[02:16] factor. Uh I can tell you in my
[02:18] conversations that are ramping up
[02:20] because of what we do, the weekly video
[02:23] I do, but also what I'm writing about.
[02:26] Uh people are just having a hard time
[02:28] figuring out are they buying AI at the
[02:31] top? And I guess I didn't realize this
[02:33] before. You know, we saw it with
[02:35] Deepseek.
[02:36] I think we saw it with liberation day in
[02:38] terms of people focusing on tariffs
[02:40] which obviously AI is not being impacted
[02:43] by tariffs other than uh sensitive
[02:45] materials that China has a strangle hold
[02:47] on that that probably force the the the
[02:50] trade negotiations to go a different
[02:51] direction. I think people are still
[02:53] having a hard time buying stocks like
[02:54] Palunteer that have gone through the
[02:56] roof. Nvidia is back at new all-time
[02:58] highs. Uh, Micron has gone from, you
[03:01] know, I think I think the first time I
[03:05] brought it up on this show is probably
[03:07] in the 70s, uh, maybe in the 60s. It's
[03:10] now up close to 130. It hit 130 this
[03:13] week. So, one of the hard things for
[03:16] people always is to buy anything that's
[03:18] had such a fast move. And that's what's
[03:21] uh messing with people. So, I think
[03:22] they're looking for lagards. And like a
[03:24] name today, Nike, uh, is up 15% as we
[03:28] sit here. and all they did was go down
[03:31] for a period of time impacted by tariffs
[03:33] and now people are looking for lagards.
[03:35] So this feels more and more every day
[03:37] like not just something that is a
[03:38] short-term thing but I think we have
[03:40] higher to go until uh until a new worry
[03:43] starts to set in for the world.
 Well it
[03:45] does feel like um when everyone was
[03:48] scared the retail investors there's tons
[03:49] of data that suggests the retail
[03:51] investors were just by the dip. They
[03:52] were pouring capital into the market.
[03:54] the institutions during the recovery uh
[03:56] they were underexposed to especially US
[03:59] equities um and so they were kind of
[04:01] sitting on the sidelines now that we are
[04:02] getting these all-time highs is kind of
[04:04] confirmatory that okay this thing is got
[04:06] momentum to it and so you start to see
[04:08] that capital come off the sidelines go
[04:10] into these assets now to your point
[04:11] about people trying to find lagards what
[04:13] I find very interesting is there's kind
[04:15] of a bifurcation in society right if you
[04:17] look at uh these kind of tech heavy
[04:19] names or the AI stocks uh those are
[04:22] things that have tons of momentum tons
[04:24] of uh kind of um uh story narrative
[04:27] behind them. But if you look at
[04:29] something like Nike, to me, it kind of
[04:31] feels like people are trying to uh tell
[04:34] a story that has nothing to do with AI.
[04:36] It has nothing to do with um kind of the
[04:38] the narratives that are dominating
[04:39] markets. Instead, maybe it's something
[04:41] where, oh, the tariffs aren't going to
[04:42] have as big of an impact as they
[04:43] previously thought they were going to
[04:44] have. So, there's like almost like this
[04:45] like relief type rally. When I look at a
[04:49] portfolio today, it does feel like this
[04:51] uh idea of acceleration is now going to
[04:54] be the theme for the next decade, right?
[04:56] Acceleration in terms of uh you
[04:58] mentioned Micron and doubling in price
[04:59] very quickly. Uh you can see the uh
[05:02] acceleration that's happened in the MAG7
[05:04] type stocks over the last 15 years or or
[05:06] 10 years or so. Uh but also there's an
[05:07] acceleration in access to information.
[05:09] There's an acceleration in the reaction
[05:11] in the market to uh emotion. People get
[05:13] very fearful. People get very greedy.
[05:15] And so it's like as we get acceleration
[05:17] across our society then you're getting
[05:20] volatility and I think ultimately that
[05:21] volatility is where uh people seem to be
[05:24] trying to figure out am I an investor
[05:25] who seeks the volatility or I'm an
[05:27] investor who tries to hide from that
[05:28] volatility.
[05:30] Yeah, it's a good point and and this is
[05:32] probably um so let let's let's give
[05:34] everyone out there three parts to what
[05:37] you just said. Um, you know, I'm I'm a
[05:39] student of of economic history. And when
[05:43] I started trading emerging markets in
[05:44] the 1990s, I studied the leading
[05:48] economic index, which is actually a very
[05:50] powerful theory behind it for both
[05:52] leading and lagging. But I don't think
[05:54] people realize that that index, which
[05:56] was created in the 1960s,
[05:59] uh, it's been
[06:02] now at least -1%. And so it's been
[06:05] between -1% I think -7% every single
[06:08] month since August of 22. Uh we've never
[06:13] had an in that index below minus1% and
[06:16] not had a recession since it was
[06:18] created. Within that are two parts of uh
[06:22] the jobs market. So there's 10
[06:25] components. Two of them are the jobs
[06:26] market. Three of them are new orders.
[06:28] There's housing. There's consumer
[06:30] sentiment. And then there's the S&P and
[06:33] there's credit. And I think what you
[06:35] mentioned for people, everyone who's
[06:36] focusing right now on say the first
[06:38] eight because the yield curve is
[06:40] included in there as well. Those are all
[06:42] screaming recession. I don't care where
[06:44] you go, new orders, we've had the the
[06:46] PMIs down low. So
[06:49] for anyone who wants to be negative,
[06:50] who's trained on history, those are the
[06:53] historical things. The S&P is a
[06:56] modern-day thing which has to do with
[06:57] profit margins. And that's where the AI
[06:59] story is happening. And to your point,
[07:02] it's only going to accelerate, meaning
[07:03] profit margins have been in there. And
[07:05] the Mag 7 right now are responsible for
[07:07] 55%
[07:09] of the earnings growth. So when people
[07:11] look at this, they hear, well, it's 30%
[07:13] of the market cap. Well, when you take
[07:15] that market cap and you apply it to the
[07:16] earnings growth, they're 55% of it. So
[07:19] when you get negative, you're by
[07:21] definition getting negative on the
[07:22] acceleration side. So that's why we
[07:25] talked about this in liberation day. I
[07:27] brought this up. If you enter the
[07:29] investing side going the opportunities
[07:31] now are to buy when everyone hates it
[07:34] and is focusing on the part of the lei
[07:36] that is not the biggest part of the
[07:38] economy and not the part that's growing
[07:40] exponentially. The part that's growing
[07:42] exponentially that you and I agreed to
[07:43] have this weekly thing on because almost
[07:46] all the wealthy people are focused on
[07:47] the other components. That is still a
[07:50] story. So I think people need to be
[07:52] opportunistic and they need to look for
[07:53] these bad times to be able to put in
[07:55] because that's where the alpha is
[07:56] generated. when you look across the AI
[07:58] story uh how are you now thinking about
[08:00] this right I think uh over the last
[08:02] couple of months uh there's been some
[08:04] different storylines obviously the
[08:05] deepse the open AIS uh the Nvidia story
[08:09] u we're now starting to see a lot of
[08:12] rumors around like things like coreweave
[08:14] and and things that are happening there
[08:15] how are you just evaluating the
[08:17] landscape are there certain areas that
[08:18] you're more excited than maybe others
[08:21] well I think this is the part that
[08:22] people are going to start to recognize
[08:24] by the end of the year and this is where
[08:26] I don't want to make a prediction on
[08:27] what's going to happen the second half
[08:28] of the year, but we have kind of this
[08:31] this force that's going to um change.
[08:34] So, since chat GPT was launched, which
[08:36] is when the AI quote unquote trade
[08:38] started, we're only 2 and a half years
[08:40] into it. And that part was really mainly
[08:43] Nvidia and then obviously the Mag 7. Uh
[08:46] the problem is for the Mag 7, they're
[08:48] spending hundreds of billions of dollars
[08:49] a year on the infrastructure. We don't
[08:52] have like a sexy trade where people can
[08:54] look at and be like this is really going
[08:55] to, you know, take a different turn. I
[08:57] can get excited about this. This is
[08:59] going to change the world. Well, we're
[09:01] now getting into the agentic side and
[09:03] this is the part and so I've tried to
[09:04] find ways to explain it to people. But
[09:06] we went from memorization, which was the
[09:08] last 2 and 1/2 years, uh, where you're
[09:11] just using a chatbot. Now you're getting
[09:13] into a different form, which is digital
[09:15] employees that are doing thinking
[09:17] through reasoning and inference. And
[09:19] that's why we've talked about it so
[09:20] much. That is an inflection point that I
[09:22] don't think people have fully grasped on
[09:24] yet. So when you mention Nike, if you go
[09:26] into Nike and you go into Perplexing,
[09:28] you say, "What did they specifically
[09:29] mention about AI?" Every company is now
[09:31] talking about AI in their conference
[09:32] calls because they have spent money to
[09:35] try and figure out how to reduce hiring
[09:37] people. I hear this time and time again
[09:39] from people that cover companies that
[09:40] the CEOs of all kinds of companies, not
[09:43] just tech companies, not just financial
[09:45] companies, not just industrial, not just
[09:47] energy, are talking about how they may
[09:49] never need to hire again. So, you're in
[09:52] this weird world. They're not saying
[09:53] they're firing lots of employees.
[09:54] They're just saying we're not going to
[09:55] hire as much, which means going forward,
[09:57] the people that are going to be hired
[09:58] are going to be digital employees. And
[10:00] the reason I said there's going to be a
[10:02] enthusiasm that doesn't sound good on
[10:04] the surface, but then when you enter
[10:06] humanoids into the equation, which is
[10:08] what I think is going to start to become
[10:09] more and more evident by the end of the
[10:11] year. Now you have something that people
[10:12] go, "Wow, this is going to create a very
[10:15] sexy investment environment. I want to
[10:17] get behind this because so far it's
[10:19] really been private companies like
[10:20] OpenAI that they can't invest in Nvidia,
[10:22] which is one company. You're getting a
[10:24] broadening out now and that's why analog
[10:26] semis, all different types are joining
[10:27] in. So I think we are going to see a
[10:29] broader market. I think the mag 7 will
[10:31] lag a little bit. Uh but overall I think
[10:33] the humanoid thing is going to be a
[10:35] major story by the end of the year.
 And
[10:36] where do you expect this that to show up
[10:38] in the economy? Are there going to be
[10:39] companies in the public market that
[10:41] people can buy? Right now really I think
[10:42] people are saying hey I can buy Tesla
[10:44] and there's kind of exposure to it. But
[10:46] many of the companies that I'm hearing
[10:47] about humanoids they're in the private
[10:49] market whether it's figure AI electronic
[10:51] or or any of these other guys. And so
[10:53] how do you think that investors,
[10:54] specifically the ones who maybe aren't
[10:56] in the private market and the venture uh
[10:58] community, how can they kind of play
[10:59] this or where do you expect them to be
[11:01] able to find uh things to get exposure?
[11:04] Yeah, it's a it's a great point and I
[11:05] and I I saw the interview you did uh
[11:07] about a month ago with Chris Camilillo
[11:09] who's obviously been all over this and
[11:10] has been involved. Uh, the first thing I
[11:12] would do is just follow his post because
[11:15] he pretty much posts about this theme
[11:17] all the time because he's invested in he
[11:19] believes it's the biggest investment
[11:21] theme he's ever seen in his lifetime.
[11:23] And it's not just him that said that.
[11:24] We've talked about this in the last
[11:25] couple weeks, but when Alon Mus says
[11:27] there's going to be more humanoids on
[11:29] the planet than people by 2035 or 2040,
[11:32] when you have Mark Andre saying this is
[11:34] going to be the biggest industry the
[11:35] world has ever seen, it's really hard
[11:37] when the companies are private. So Tesla
[11:39] is the one public one. And I think
[11:41] because they have all these other
[11:42] components to them, that's why they're
[11:43] being viewed so differently than most
[11:46] people know them as a car company. The
[11:47] fact that most people think of them as a
[11:49] car company means there's tremendous
[11:50] opportunity in my opinion for Tesla. Uh
[11:52] regardless of what's happening in the
[11:54] politics in the company, but honestly,
[11:56] that's where Micron fits in for me.
[11:58] That's where the analog semiconductors
[12:00] fit in. Um it's starting to become
[12:02] known. And if you go into perplexity and
[12:03] you ask for what Mike said, the amount
[12:06] of memory that's needed for the thinking
[12:09] and reasoning component and that's the
[12:11] part that I think people have to go when
[12:12] you start putting brains into machines
[12:15] to make this simplified uh where they're
[12:17] not allowed to have hallucinations where
[12:19] they have to learn and remember
[12:21] everything so they're getting better.
[12:22] the memory side becomes really really
[12:24] important and this is where Micron SK
[12:28] Highex Samsung to a lesser degree as a
[12:30] percentage of their business. These are
[12:32] all places that people go, but
[12:33] unfortunately it's those types of
[12:36] places. And then eventually, as I said,
[12:37] the bottleneck becomes the power side.
[12:39] And that's the other place that people
[12:40] should be barbelling in their in their
[12:42] portfolios is looking um for power
[12:45] companies. And I think the only two mega
[12:47] ones that are going to be able to help
[12:49] produce the power that's necessary in
[12:50] the short term because nuclear won't get
[12:52] us there is companies like Exxon and
[12:54] Chevron, believe it or not, because
[12:55] they're big enough to kind of make this
[12:56] transition. And are they openly talking
[12:58] about this right now that they're going
[12:59] to be providing that power or is that
[13:01] kind of an indirect line uh that you're
[13:03] making to say, "Hey, these guys have the
[13:05] power or or do are they aware of this
[13:07] and trying to kind of position
[13:08] themselves?"
 Yeah, I wrote a research
[13:11] report for 22V where a good portion of
[13:14] it was highlighting the commentary they
[13:15] made. My my belief in this is if if a
[13:18] company hasn't spoken about it, they
[13:20] there's no way. This is one of the
[13:22] beauties of, you know, using any of the
[13:25] LLMs, but particular I say Perplexity
[13:27] because they have the transcripts in
[13:29] there and it's instantaneous to get
[13:31] there. So, you can ask multiple
[13:32] questions and go through it. But they
[13:33] have specifically mentioned the gas
[13:36] fired plants as being the bridge to
[13:38] where nuclear and and and other
[13:40] components are going to be. The fact
[13:42] that they have the scale, they have the
[13:43] balance sheet, they have the money, they
[13:45] can do all this stuff. Uh that's what's
[13:48] made them publicly speak about it. But
[13:50] then they also highlight in there that
[13:51] they've had conversations with the
[13:53] hyperscalers. So when you line all that
[13:55] up and you kind of see that all right
[13:57] that's now but the reasoning stuff just
[14:00] went in and that's why when we brought
[14:01] up the token usage the token usage and
[14:04] just how exponential it's going which
[14:06] has been confirmed by every hyperscaler.
[14:08] Um that's where I think the power thing
[14:10] is just again you got to get in front of
[14:12] these exponential innovations. So, Exxon
[14:14] and Chevron might look like ga oil
[14:16] companies, gas companies right now, uh,
[14:18] which they are, but on the flip side,
[14:20] they're going to be benefiting from the
[14:21] power, I'm sure. So,
 now Salesforce is
[14:24] not going after humanoid robots from
[14:25] what I understand, but they are talking
[14:27] a lot about AI replacing some of the
[14:29] jobs. I've seen numbers as big as 30 to
[14:31] 50% um, in some of the commentary there.
[14:33] I know you've been looking at this.
[14:35] What's going on with Salesforce and how
[14:36] is that playing into this AI story?

[15:42] Maple, the go-to place for onchain asset
[15:44] management. There aren't many teams in
[15:45] crypto who manage real money the right
[15:47] way, but Maple does. Maple now manages

[16:17] not going after humanoid robots from
[16:19] what I understand, but they are talking
[16:20] a lot about AI replacing some of the
[16:22] jobs. I've seen numbers as big as 30 to
[16:25] 50% um in some of the commentary there.
[16:27] I know you've been looking at this.
[16:28] What's going on with Salesforce and how
[16:30] is that playing into this AI story?
[16:32] Yeah, they've been the leader of talking
[16:34] about AI agents. Um, and what they were
[16:37] saying before was that their customers,
[16:40] uh, and I'll just mention specifically,
[16:42] they they talked openly, or Mark Benoff
[16:44] did, that one of their customers,
[16:45] Disney, would be able to utilize through
[16:48] the CRM system, um, the ability of
[16:52] having agents to kind of be smarter
[16:53] about things, about booking things,
[16:55] about call center, stuff like that. What
[16:57] Mark Benoff talked about this week was
[16:59] that their workload inside the company,
[17:01] so forget kind of the external side of
[17:03] you using it. He said that 30 to 50% of
[17:06] the workload is now being done through
[17:08] AI. So this gets back to the point of
[17:11] it's not just the adoption side from
[17:13] enterprises which is accelerating at
[17:14] this point. It's the efficiencies that
[17:16] all companies are able to do with inside
[17:18] their business for things that Walmart
[17:20] has been given uh you know a higher
[17:22] multiple for. If you're able to deal
[17:24] with inventory and you're able to deal
[17:26] with kind of the maintenance side, the
[17:27] cost side, Nike specifically mentioned
[17:30] inventory management on their call,
[17:32] you're going to have all of these
[17:33] companies again that have the tech
[17:35] people, they have the money, they have
[17:37] the need to focus on profit margins. It
[17:40] just becomes something that labor is a
[17:43] really really big component of the cost
[17:45] of running a business. Wages in this
[17:47] country are 50% of personal income. uh
[17:50] you're just going to have this scenario
[17:52] where every company is going to be
[17:53] focused on this going forward.
 What I
[17:56] wonder is how many of these companies
[17:57] are okay, we're going to hire less
[17:58] people in the future because of this
[18:00] trend versus we are going to fire
[18:03] employees like there's a cost cutting
[18:04] versus a cost uh you know maybe slowing.
[18:07] Um but also uh do we start to see data
[18:10] where people can actually quantitatively
[18:12] measure if I give these tools to my
[18:14] employees there's an increase in
[18:15] productivity and maybe that just shows
[18:17] up in revenue and profit but it does
[18:19] feel like there is you know kind of hey
[18:20] I can use this to replace people or I
[18:22] can use this to augment people uh and
[18:25] the companies that win in the future
[18:26] they're going to have to do both right
[18:27] there are certain jobs that can be
[18:28] automated away but then there are a ton
[18:30] of things that you're going to get a
[18:31] benefit from if you just hand the right
[18:33] tools to the right people
[18:35] yeah so you and I have talked about one
[18:36] thing that I think is really important.
[18:38] Let's let's let's go backwards from the
[18:41] public companies to answer this question
[18:43] to the private companies. So businesses
[18:45] can now start and race really fast and
[18:47] get to 5 million ARR with hiring no
[18:50] people. Um you can get to a billion
[18:52] dollar company with very small amounts
[18:53] of people. To do that it's going to be
[18:55] all AI or or SL tech side. So gradually
[19:00] entrepreneurs are figuring ways to just
[19:02] use AI to get there. So if you're a tech
[19:04] company that that's in the software
[19:05] world, if you've got a lot of coders,
[19:07] you obviously can fire people because
[19:10] those were expensive jobs. Those were
[19:12] hard to get and now all of a sudden
[19:13] you've been able to replace them very
[19:15] quickly. So I think the coding jobs will
[19:17] immediately go. So the more techoriented
[19:19] I think you'll see firings at smaller
[19:21] businesses where the bigger businesses I
[19:24] think it's less of hiring because
[19:25] they've had to hire at very large pace
[19:27] over the last whatever years to grow. So
[19:29] I think you'll see less hiring for the
[19:31] big companies. you'll see firings for
[19:33] the smaller techreated companies, but
[19:35] for the majority of the S&P 500 in the
[19:38] non- tech area, I definitely think it's
[19:41] going to be less hiring. And one of the
[19:43] things people, and I I'll be showing
[19:45] this on the video um this weekend,
[19:48] Mag 7 are still growing their revenues
[19:50] at double digits. Historically, what
[19:53] happens is the S&P 500 would have a
[19:56] multiple of revenue growth somewhere,
[19:59] let's say about 1 and a half times what
[20:01] nominal GDP is. Well, nominal GDP right
[20:03] now is about 4.7 to 5%. Right now, if
[20:07] you go through the non-mag 7, so the S&P
[20:10] 493, their revenue growth is right at
[20:12] that level, exactly at it. So, we've
[20:14] lost the multiple. And this is where I
[20:17] believe we're getting a lot of startup
[20:19] businesses that are never going public
[20:20] that are growing their revenues at an
[20:22] incredibly fast pace. You've seen it
[20:24] with some of the entrepreneurs you've
[20:26] worked with. Um that market to me is
[20:28] going to grow rapidly. That is the pure
[20:30] not hiring people. They don't need to
[20:32] fire people. The bigger businesses are
[20:33] in a good situation right now because
[20:36] they can see their profit margins get
[20:37] better without hiring people. But how is
[20:39] a Ford or a GM that has massive amounts
[20:42] of debt going to be able to do anything
[20:43] for their business? And that's why the
[20:44] S&P 493, it contains a lot of different
[20:47] businesses, but I don't see them as able
[20:50] to do what the Mag 7 have done. And most
[20:52] importantly, I don't think they can grow
[20:54] their revenues in as fast as these
[20:56] smaller businesses. So you have the
[20:57] MAG7, you have these private companies
[20:59] that are growing rapidly. And then you
[21:01] have the S&P 493 where the bulk of them
[21:03] are just never going to be able to
[21:04] compete. And I think they're going to
[21:06] gradually go out of business if they
[21:07] have debt and they can't grow their
[21:09] topline revenues subi significantly more
[21:12] than the nominal GDP side.
 So one of the
[21:15] things that is kind of an overlay on top
[21:16] of all of this is obviously monetary
[21:18] policy. We see M2 money supply growing.
[21:20] The Bitcoiners are yelling and screaming
[21:21] out of excitement that Bitcoin is going
[21:23] to go up a lot because uh money supply
[21:24] is growing. uh the government seems to
[21:28] at least this administration have had a
[21:30] some secret meeting where they all came
[21:31] together and they said Jerome Powell
[21:33] he's the target and now we see tons of
[21:36] them publicly coming out and applying
[21:38] immense pressure on the Federal Reserve
[21:39] to cut interest rates. Now I happen to
[21:41] agree that interest rates should be cut
[21:43] but put that aside for a second as to
[21:44] what they actually should do or should
[21:46] not do. It feels like the government
[21:49] pressure is a important story that is
[21:52] not really being talked about nearly as
[21:54] much. And you know, I don't know what
[21:56] your opinion on this is, but when Trump
[21:58] in his first term did this, when Biden
[22:00] did this, now Trump's doing it again.
[22:02] I've always called out and said, look,
[22:04] it's important that the Fed is
[22:05] independent, but let's be serious here.
[22:07] It's kind of like, you know, you get
[22:08] called to the principal's office and
[22:10] there's likely to be, you know, humans
[22:12] involved and they do succumb to the
[22:14] pressure to some degree. Is that kind of
[22:15] how you read the situation?
[22:17] Yeah, I I think you know the one thing
[22:19] we've learned about Donald Trump, um if
[22:22] he keeps saying something over and over
[22:23] and over again, um I would incorporate
[22:26] it into what's going to happen in the
[22:28] future. Uh he has publicly been all over
[22:30] pal his staff, as we talked about I
[22:33] think two weeks ago, both Lutneck and JD
[22:36] Vance were out there. Bessent has been
[22:37] out there. The pressure is coming
[22:39] verbally from the people that are
[22:41] directly tied to him. But now you're
[22:43] getting into other things where they're
[22:46] talking about a new Fed chair and naming
[22:48] him uh naming that person in September
[22:50] to have a shadow Fed there. And this
[22:52] becomes a big story. I think it's quite
[22:54] evident that they're continuing on a
[22:57] path. And I I I believe that the Fed
[23:00] should be cutting rates. And the reason
[23:01] I believe that is what I mentioned about
[23:04] the stock market where there's a few
[23:06] companies that are benefiting
[23:07] significantly. There's a lot of small
[23:10] tiny private companies that are doing
[23:12] well, but the majority of people in the
[23:15] country are not doing well. And this
[23:17] problem, we we talked about the job
[23:19] situation. We talked about digital
[23:20] employees. What is the job of the Fed to
[23:23] focus on containing inflation where
[23:27] again, if they want to raise rates 100
[23:28] basis points, they can certainly do
[23:30] that. Shouldn't they be airing right now
[23:32] on the other side if the job market is
[23:34] soft, which it is? Um, I mentioned on a
[23:37] on a call I did today, uh, that the
[23:39] year-over-year non-farm payroll is now
[23:41] 1.08%.
[23:43] So, there are 1.08%
[23:45] more people hired right now versus a
[23:48] year ago. That may sound like a big
[23:50] number. Obviously, when you're dealing
[23:52] withund,
[23:54] let's say, 160 million people, that's
[23:55] approximately 1.6 million people that
[23:57] are that are added. But the problem with
[24:00] that is that that number historically of
[24:02] only adding a million that means we're
[24:04] entering a recession. So I think with
[24:07] where things are that the inflation rate
[24:10] has given them the chance to cut rates.
[24:11] We had a negative GDP print in the first
[24:13] quarter. We're going to have a positive
[24:15] one the second. But when you combine the
[24:16] two of them, you're talking sub 2% real
[24:19] GDP at a time when inflation is low. So
[24:21] I do believe the Fed should be cutting.
[24:23] I believe it's for the median voter. And
[24:26] I think what you saw with the election
[24:27] in New York this week and the types, you
[24:30] know, the demographics of where the
[24:32] voting is and what I've shown before,
[24:34] graduates and young people are really,
[24:36] really angry at the system. Forget all
[24:39] the things that people are getting into.
[24:41] I think it is very, very hard with the
[24:42] affordability side at where it is, which
[24:45] obviously can be impacted by lowering
[24:47] rates. I think where the job situation
[24:49] is competing with AI is a problem. And I
[24:52] think college graduates are having for
[24:54] the first time in history a really
[24:55] really hard time of not only getting a
[24:57] job but thinking that they're going to
[24:59] be able to work their way up the
[25:00] corporate ladder. So I think there's a
[25:02] growing mistrust and really uh anger
[25:05] towards all incumbent uh officials and I
[25:08] think that's why Trump is going to
[25:09] continue to put pressure because he
[25:11] wants rates lowered not just for that
[25:12] reason but also because we have a debt
[25:15] problem that is dependent on rates
[25:16] moving lower on the front end. Now uh
[25:18] Manni has I think woken up the United
[25:21] States of America. Uh he is openly a
[25:24] socialist. He has said that capitalism
[25:26] is not the best system. He's called for
[25:27] the defunding of the police. He has uh
[25:30] even on his uh tax policy that he
[25:33] published his logo on it and everything
[25:36] said that he wants to increase taxes on
[25:38] wealthier, whiter neighborhoods and
[25:40] redistribute that. I mean just things
[25:42] that 10 years ago you would think are
[25:44] absolutely crazy that they could never
[25:46] possibly be popular. Now on the other
[25:48] side of this uh I think that there are a
[25:51] lot of people as you're describing who
[25:53] are just saying to themselves all I know
[25:55] is that my situation is not good. I need
[25:58] somebody who is going to understand my
[26:00] plight. Somebody who is going to have
[26:02] some sort of solution. And so it does
[26:04] feel like uh you get in this weird
[26:06] situation where by identifying by um
[26:10] acknowledging the problem, you obviously
[26:13] are going to have a sympathetic
[26:14] audience, but then showing up and
[26:17] saying, "By the way, the solution is I'm
[26:18] going to give you free stuff and you
[26:20] don't have to work and uh we're just
[26:21] going to redistribute all the wealth."
[26:23] Sounds great if you're in that
[26:25] demographic, but the problem is that uh
[26:27] it doesn't work. And so um I keep coming
[26:31] back to this idea of
[26:34] how does the financial market evolve if
[26:38] actually a very big portion I don't know
[26:41] if it's majority but a big portion of
[26:43] this younger demographic is showing up
[26:46] and saying the system itself is broken
[26:49] the system is evil the capitalism
[26:52] economics all these things that I think
[26:54] are pretty well accepted by people who
[26:56] are millennials and older
[26:58] this younger generation is essentially
[27:00] showing up with a socialist mindset,
[27:02] right? And and does that change
[27:04] financial markets? Are there things that
[27:05] investors in the market should do
[27:07] differently that account for this
[27:10] younger generation kind of entering the
[27:12] workforce? Um, or was every single
[27:15] generation the same? They all had these
[27:17] crazy, you know, wildeyed ideas and then
[27:19] kind of they meet reality and they
[27:20] realize, oh, wait a second. Doesn't
[27:21] matter how much I yell and scream. I got
[27:22] to work to make money. Today's episode

[28:47] Bitcoin and we get to now have a
[28:49] conversation about why not only it's
[28:51] done so well, but my own journey there.
[28:53] So, let let's go back to something. Um,
[28:56] and I I I I brought this up on the video
[29:00] last week and we've talked about it, but
[29:01] I I want to bring up Joseph Shumpert
[29:03] again. And I probably every time I say
[29:04] it, people don't go just go into an LLM.
[29:07] You don't have to go read anything but
[29:09] Joseph Shumper. All you have to do is go
[29:10] into Chat GPT, go into Perplexity, go
[29:13] into Gemini and just type in what were
[29:16] Joseph Shumper's economic theories about
[29:19] capitalism
[29:20] and at what point does socialism start
[29:24] to become the answer to capitalism and
[29:27] he will go through and he's the father
[29:30] of creative destruction. So he talked
[29:33] about how innovation
[29:35] eventually accelerates so fast that it
[29:37] causes capitalism to be broken. So
[29:39] rather than say the system and the fact
[29:41] that people don't feel like they're
[29:42] participating,
[29:44] I started heading down this journey in
[29:46] 2013 about exponential innovation and
[29:49] the dangers it would have towards the
[29:50] fabric of capitalism. If you continued
[29:53] to have a divide in terms of inequality
[29:55] and you continued to have a few people
[29:56] that had most of the money, you would
[29:59] eventually cause problems. And the
[30:01] easiest way to cause what has happened
[30:02] in New York City, in fact, the only way
[30:04] for it to happen is through younger
[30:06] people. That's the only way. The younger
[30:09] people don't have a belief that the
[30:11] system will come back. They believe the
[30:13] system has been worsening every single
[30:15] year. And so if you take anyone right
[30:17] now that is um you know 25 years or
[30:20] younger,
[30:22] what have they experienced? I mean the
[30:24] internet you know really started to
[30:26] accelerate in 2000 as a part of our
[30:28] lives. Amazon became a company and then
[30:30] all of a sudden you had the smartphones
[30:32] and they at those time the 25-year-old
[30:34] at that time was 8 years old. So they're
[30:36] feeling right now the pressures that are
[30:39] coming from what happened with the
[30:41] smartphone. Less jobs, very few
[30:43] companies that are doing well. There's a
[30:45] reason why uh burger places in New York
[30:47] that people love like Prime Burger and
[30:49] all these old diner type places have
[30:51] gone out of business have been replaced
[30:52] with these very very efficient, you
[30:55] know, salad companies and Chipotle and
[30:58] all of these things. It's because
[30:59] technology and innovation is happening
[31:01] in slow motion and getting us there.
[31:03] What has now entered up in the situation
[31:05] when you get to young people is they are
[31:08] voting for a different system. The
[31:10] benefit is the or the the reality is the
[31:12] reason they're doing this is because
[31:14] they can't live the dream that they
[31:15] thought was supposed to be there. You
[31:17] have a you you get a job, you move up
[31:18] the corporate ladder, you get paid more
[31:20] money every year. You don't have to
[31:22] worry about getting fired when you're a
[31:23] young person unless you're in the bottom
[31:24] 10% of the employees and you kind of
[31:27] move up. Then you get a family, then you
[31:29] go buy a house. That entire path is
[31:31] gone. You start out with student debt,
[31:34] you can't feel certainty in your job,
[31:36] and then you can't buy a house. Plain
[31:37] and simple. That's it. Peter Teal
[31:39] literally just posted something about
[31:40] this on why the students are so angry
[31:42] and why socialism is happening. So, I
[31:45] think where Bitcoin fits into it, it is
[31:47] the system that eventually is built
[31:50] through the disruption of all
[31:52] businesses. And that's why I keep saying
[31:54] Bitcoin for me is the S&P 500.
[31:56] eventually the way that young people
[31:58] will benefit in a world of abundance
[32:00] where you don't actually need the money
[32:02] because the prices of everything have
[32:03] gone down and your identity is not based
[32:06] around your job to where you have to be
[32:08] an entrepreneur, you have to change jobs
[32:10] constantly, you have to be creative, you
[32:11] have to go through it. If we're in a
[32:12] world that is moving so fast that there
[32:14] isn't a company to go work at in a desk
[32:17] and you're working remotely and you're
[32:18] moving from place to place and travel
[32:20] and leisure becomes part of your life, I
[32:22] think younger people are better prepared
[32:23] for that. So I think socialism is just
[32:26] the next point of the capitalism side
[32:29] and the more people are angry the more
[32:31] money the government has to print.
[32:32] That's why the transfer payments are
[32:34] going up and that's why at the end
[32:35] Bitcoin will not stop going higher
[32:37] regardless of what people say. It will
[32:39] replace a lot of the fiat assets over
[32:41] time. And do you look at um we have to
[32:44] eat into that you know uh there's a guy
[32:47] Mad Mahop who uh I don't think you've
[32:49] ever met before but in uh 2019 probably
[32:52] uh him and I sat down and it was one of
[32:54] the first conversations where uh I
[32:57] listened to the person I was talking to
[32:59] and as soon as it ended I said to him
[33:01] hold on one second and I turned to my
[33:03] computer and I bought more Bitcoin and I
[33:05] was already pretty bullish but he I mean
[33:07] he really hammered it home for me and
[33:08] his whole thought process was take every
[33:10] store of value asset in the world.
[33:11] Obviously, people think of gold, people
[33:13] think of treasuries and dollars and
[33:14] things like that. Uh, but think about
[33:17] real estate, think about art, think
[33:19] about, you know, anything that stores
[33:21] value for people from an investment
[33:22] standpoint. Bitcoin is going to eat into
[33:24] those things and therefore Bitcoin is
[33:25] going to be much bigger than anyone
[33:27] believes. And I think that we are
[33:29] starting to see that in some areas. But
[33:31] what has started to happen, which I
[33:33] think is even more fascinating, is I
[33:35] used to think that Bitcoin would eclipse
[33:36] gold's market cap, and it would happen
[33:38] somewhere around six to seven trillion.
[33:39] At the time, gold's market cap was 10.
[33:41] And so, you were going to demonetize
[33:43] gold, and that capital was going to
[33:44] shift into Bitcoin. The opposite has
[33:46] happened. Actually, Bitcoin has been
[33:47] successful, and gold has gotten bigger.
[33:49] Gold has almost doubled its market cap
[33:51] during that time frame. And so, Bitcoin
[33:53] is still growing at a faster rate, will
[33:54] likely eclipse gold at some point in the
[33:56] future, but some of these store value
[33:58] assets in other sectors, they're not
[34:00] suffering at the hands of Bitcoin.
[34:02] They're all going up together. And so,
[34:04] it's almost like the pie is expanding
[34:06] more so than it is a zero- sum game. Why
[34:08] is that?
 Well, first of all, I I I think
[34:12] it appears that way. I actually think
[34:14] there's
[34:16] there's something happening under the
[34:18] hood that people have to grasp onto. So,
[34:20] first of all, stocks and bonds make up
[34:22] about I don't know half of the $500
[34:25] trillion.
[34:27] Real estate makes up a huge component of
[34:30] it. Um, and real estate prices are not
[34:32] going higher the way they did. And this
[34:35] is part of the issue that I think has
[34:36] has happened to people is housing went
[34:39] up here because we printed so much money
[34:41] in COVID and we have a shortage and it
[34:43] drove house prices up. Well, we just had
[34:46] negative month overmonth house prices in
[34:48] the last month. That may not sound like
[34:51] a big deal. That does not happen too
[34:53] often. And aside from 2022, it didn't
[34:56] happen except for during recession. So
[34:57] for house prices to actually go down at
[34:59] all is a problem. Think about what's
[35:01] happening in China where they're going
[35:02] down significantly. Uh as real estate
[35:05] has kind of gone sideways. Then you go
[35:07] look at bonds. Well, bonds haven't gone
[35:09] up either. We've seen rates, we're in a
[35:11] bond bear market right now compared to
[35:13] where we were. So if you look at any
[35:14] bond measure and you go say, well, what
[35:17] has it done since 2019 when we started
[35:19] printing money, it's done nothing. The
[35:21] Barclay's a basically unchanged down uh
[35:24] across the globe. So if real estate has
[35:27] kind of reached its peak point and
[35:30] you've reached that for bonds, well
[35:31] that's most of it. So I think gold is
[35:34] doing well because those things are not
[35:36] doing well and because most of the
[35:38] wealthy people at this point if you ask
[35:40] a person worth a billion dollars, do
[35:41] they own gold? The answer is generally
[35:43] going to be yes. Do they own real
[35:44] estate? 100% they do. Do they own
[35:47] Bitcoin? No. The majority of them don't
[35:49] unless they're below the age of 60. And
[35:52] so the concentration of wealth and the
[35:54] biggest argument for Bitcoin is as a
[35:56] billionaire in their 60s, let's make it
[35:59] in their 80s dies and they give money to
[36:01] their kids. Their kids don't view the
[36:03] world the same way that they did. So the
[36:06] transfer of wealth is going to have this
[36:07] this impact. But I think the biggest
[36:10] impact and this is why this year I think
[36:12] it's going significantly higher in the
[36:13] second half. what Donald Trump is doing.
[36:17] The dollar went down again this week and
[36:19] it went down because he does not care
[36:20] about Fed independence. Like every thing
[36:24] that we believed in that is really
[36:26] important to the financial system for
[36:28] people that are older and educated is
[36:30] breaking down. That's why gold has done
[36:32] well, but now we're getting into the job
[36:35] market. I cannot say this loud enough to
[36:37] people. We are entering the world where
[36:40] thinking and reasoning, decisionmaking
[36:43] is going to be part of a company done by
[36:46] digital employees. We're going to have
[36:48] humanoids walking down the street with
[36:50] us in within 5 years. You will be
[36:52] walking next to them. You're going to
[36:53] start seeing Whimo in New York City.
[36:55] There's a difference between it being in
[36:56] San Francisco and Austin, Texas. When
[36:58] you start bringing Whimo and driverless
[37:00] cars into Manhattan, I think that's a
[37:02] wakeup call. I mean, we had protests
[37:04] from Uber when it was moving across the
[37:06] globe. what's going to happen when Whimo
[37:08] and robo taxis really start taking off
[37:10] and humanoids start taking jobs and
[37:12] there's no strikes. So, I think Bitcoin
[37:14] is going to benefit right now from the
[37:16] unrest that is seemingly happening at a
[37:18] faster pace from the job situation and
[37:21] the fact that the government is saying
[37:22] we don't believe in Fed independence. We
[37:24] don't believe in the reserve currency.
[37:25] All of these things are breaking down
[37:27] right now.
 Did you see what happened
[37:28] with Mr. Beast with with Jimmy? he uh he
[37:32] released a new product and uh in this
[37:34] product it basically is an AI thumbnail
[37:36] creator. So you go on, you type in what
[37:39] you want and it creates it and you can
[37:41] say um hey make me a thumbnail in the
[37:44] style of Mr. Beast that has a green car
[37:46] or you can upload a photo and one of the
[37:49] examples he used in a launch video was
[37:50] it was F1's logo and had an arrow to an
[37:53] F1 car and he uploaded it and he said
[37:56] switch the car with a minivan and then
[37:58] it makes the same thing just post
[37:59] minivan. Right? I mean things that
[38:01] people who are paying attention to AI
[38:02] are like obviously this is going to be a
[38:03] thing. He released it. Now he's Mr.
[38:05] Beast, biggest YouTuber in the world.
[38:08] Massive backlash from the YouTube
[38:10] community. All the thumbnail editors,
[38:12] all the quote unquote artists are all
[38:14] sitting there saying, "Oh my god, you're
[38:16] coming for our jobs, yada yada,
[38:18] whatever."
[38:19] He capitulated. He bent the knee.
[38:22] Complete error in my opinion. I love him
[38:25] to death. He's incredible human. Very
[38:27] nice. obviously hyper successful uh
[38:30] genuinely cares about doing right by
[38:32] people and he capitulated and he came
[38:34] out and he said you know what we've
[38:35] taken down the product instead what
[38:36] we've replaced it with is essentially a
[38:38] marketplace you now if you would like uh
[38:40] somebody to create uh thumbnails for you
[38:42] we are going to you know recommend you
[38:43] to thumbnail editors
[38:46] and from my perspective
[38:49] you cannot let yourself or the future be
[38:53] held hostage by people who are unwilling
[38:55] to adopt new tools like being a farmer
[38:58] and somebody saying to you, "You can't
[38:59] use the tractor cuz my horse is going to
[39:01] be out of business." That's not your
[39:03] problem, right? You have to continue to
[39:06] push the edge of innovation because
[39:07] guess what happens is actually
[39:09] everything will get better. You will see
[39:11] now tons of people who can't afford a
[39:13] thumbnail editor now have access to one.
[39:15] Now what about their ability to create a
[39:17] living on YouTube, right? You're taking
[39:19] away their opportunity to give it to
[39:21] people who don't want to adopt new tool.
[39:23] So like this whole thing now is
[39:25] happening and it's not showing up in
[39:27] like hardcore technology. Like the
[39:28] YouTube ecosystem is now having the
[39:30] debate as to whether the largest
[39:32] YouTuber in the world should be using AI
[39:34] or is he being essentially disrespectful
[39:36] and hurting the thumbnail artist. So
[39:39] what do you think about that?
[39:42] I guess in the one side uh
[39:45] I mean I agree with what you're saying.
[39:47] I just think when people get so big and
[39:52] let's just take Mr. Beast and equate it
[39:54] to Taylor Swift. Um they kind of don't
[39:57] want to do anything that uh
[40:01] let's say hurts their image. Mhm.
 But
[40:04] what I will say is you could use the
[40:06] Taylor Swift side of Scooter Brawn and
[40:08] how she tried to get around that whole
[40:11] thing and just reissue all of her albums
[40:15] as new albums to try and make it less
[40:18] valuable. And I I always thought and I
[40:20] wrote something about this that that was
[40:21] kind of what's going to happen with AI
[40:24] and copying things. So on the one side
[40:28] for someone who's who's become so
[40:30] popular and depends on their users and
[40:32] depends on the influence side and
[40:34] depends on a lot of parts that
[40:37] they just don't want their image torn at
[40:38] any point. At the same time uh and I
[40:41] think the job situation is where this is
[40:43] going to be come in. I think anyone
[40:45] that's hurting jobs particularly in the
[40:47] digital world from AI you're going to
[40:51] have backlash. I just think it's going
[40:54] to happen. But I think your your point
[40:55] you're bringing up something really
[40:56] interesting that I have to spend time on
[40:58] to think about just because we are at
[41:00] that time and age where all of these
[41:02] things with copying
[41:04] doing something that immediately
[41:06] eliminates jobs is going to be there.
[41:08] But if he doesn't do it, someone else
[41:10] will do it. So
 100%. And the reason I
[41:12] thought of it is uh when Whimo comes to
[41:14] New York City, you're going to see taxi
[41:16] drivers getting out of their car beating
[41:17] the cars 100%. Right? You want to see a
[41:20] Whimo get set on fire, bring it to New
[41:22] York City. I promise you somebody's
[41:23] going to do it, right? They shouldn't do
[41:25] it. They should get in trouble for it,
[41:27] but they're still going to do it.
[41:28] They're going to get out with a baseball
[41:29] bat. They're going to, you know, I mean,
[41:30] like, you you know how all this is going
[41:31] to play out,
 but the self-driving car
[41:34] will win.
 It may it may lose the the
[41:36] battle, but it'll win the war, right?
[41:38] Yeah. And and that's the point of how
[41:40] long it takes for this stuff to go
[41:42] through it. The the problem is um unlike
[41:45] with Uber,
[41:47] I just don't think people realize how
[41:48] much faster AI is moving relative to
[41:51] what was going on with apps. You could
[41:53] come up with an idea, you could build
[41:55] it,
[41:58] it would take 3 years before anyone else
[42:00] knew about it. And so you had a moat
[42:01] around your business. The problem is
[42:03] this is going to move so fast that to
[42:06] your point, I just don't think human
[42:08] beings are going to be able to handle. I
[42:10] know governments won't be able to move
[42:11] fast enough. I just don't think workers
[42:13] and people fully grasp. It's funny
[42:14] because I've had a couple people reach
[42:16] out saying that my message has been
[42:18] inconsistent when it comes to let's say
[42:21] jobs because we do live in a world where
[42:24] there's a shortage of jobs. If you want
[42:26] to go be a daycare worker, trust me,
[42:28] there's not enough people. If you want
[42:30] to go be work in Dunkin Donuts, I'm in
[42:32] Maine right now. There's Dunkin Donuts
[42:34] signs everywhere. Every single summer is
[42:35] the same thing. They can't enough can't
[42:37] get enough people in the hotels, any of
[42:39] this stuff. But the problem is those
[42:41] jobs don't pay well enough for people to
[42:44] go into them to be able to live in the
[42:46] places. So a daycare person, a nanny in
[42:48] New York City, you're going to be able
[42:50] to get a lot of money theoretically, but
[42:53] the problem is you can't live in New
[42:56] York City and have that job. So in every
[42:58] place in the world right now, I just
[42:59] think it's really, really difficult and
[43:01] the labor situation is going to be under
[43:03] pressure while the S&P is going higher.
[43:06] It's a very, very unique time. And I
[43:08] think your point is it's going to make a
[43:10] lot of people angry as they see the
[43:12] wealthy doing well and everyone else
[43:14] having a harder time.
 We're going to all
[43:17] sit and watch it play out together, my
[43:19] friend. Uh where can we send people to
[43:20] find you on the internet?
 Uh YouTube uh
[43:24] every Sunday I'm posting an X a little
[43:27] less, but hopefully that'll pick up now
[43:29] that the summer is here. Uh 22V
[43:32] Research, 22V Securities, whatever
[43:34] they're using right now as their main
[43:37] hub. Uh, I'm putting a lot of investment
[43:39] research there and then my Substack I'm
[43:41] writing every single week. So, they can
[43:43] find me there as well as with Pomp.
[43:46] Jordy, you're doing a fantastic job. I
[43:48] enjoyed talking to you every week. Can
[43:49] we'll do it again next week? Save
 it
[43:51] here, bud. Thanks.
