[00:00] If the major economies are starting to
[00:02] use BTC as a macro hedge and then not
[00:04] just gold, that means we're we've
[00:05] progressed way further than we ever
[00:07] thought we were going to have um
[00:09] progressed in the last 10 years and that
[00:11] happened all over the last 2 years. Um
[00:14] so BTC as a geopolitical asset I think
[00:17] is really important. Why? Censorship
[00:20] resistant, borderless neutral countries
[00:22] that have inflation risk or political
[00:23] instability, they're going to probably
[00:24] think about it. It might actually create
[00:26] more stability for their countries
[00:27] because it's a hedge. And then for the
[00:29] US, it's an edge. What's going on, guys?
[00:32] Today, we've got an excellent episode
[00:33] with Orjun Seti. He is the co-CEO of
[00:35] Kraken and someone that I've known for a
[00:37] long time. He's a fantastic investor and
[00:39] someone who thinks very deeply about
[00:41] Bitcoin, crypto, and the traditional
[00:43] financial system. In this conversation,
[00:45] we cover what's going on at the
[00:46] intersection of traditional finance and
[00:48] crypto, why open permissionless systems
[00:50] are going to be the default, how things
[00:52] like Bitcoin and tokenized stocks are
[00:53] going to fit into that system, what it
[00:55] means for individual professional
[00:57] traders, and also how regulation and the
[00:59] traditional players will all play into
[01:01] the system. Arjun understands where the
[01:03] world is going better than most people
[01:04] that I know. And today, he lays out
[01:06] exactly how the infrastructure will get
[01:08] built and what it means for you sitting
[01:09] at home. So I hope you enjoy my latest
[01:11] conversation with Arjent Sethi or I
[01:13] thought a great place to start the
[01:14] conversation is uh Robin Hood is
[01:16] considered a traditional brokerage. They
[01:18] sell stocks but now they've added crypto
[01:20] fast growing segment of their business.
[01:21] Kraken, you guys are traditionally a
[01:23] crypto business but now you guys are
[01:25] adding US equities. It feels like
[01:27] everything is just kind of converging in
[01:29] the middle and whether you're an
[01:30] exchange or some other provider of a
[01:32] financial product, you're going to
[01:33] operate with a foot in the traditional
[01:35] world and a foot in the crypto world. Is
[01:36] that how you see this playing out or is
[01:38] there something else that we should be
[01:39] aware of?
[01:40] Look, I think one of the areas that
[01:42] people kind of miss is like what does
[01:45] the future of finance look like? And so
[01:47] during the the 70s and ' 80s time frame,
[01:49] you had Michael Milin talk about the
[01:52] democratization of finance and like the
[01:53] types of products that were built on top
[01:55] of it. And so the the the future of
[01:58] finance at the time was essentially US
[02:00] world capital markets. If you think
[02:02] about what's happening now is you're
[02:04] hearing these themes and it's not just
[02:06] today it's you know over the last 10
[02:08] years we've been pushing these themes um
[02:11] in in the you know traditional venture
[02:13] Silicon Valley ecosystem we used to say
[02:14] fintech but it was a closed economy
[02:16] closed system closed experience um what
[02:19] we're really talking about here today
[02:21] what I sort of um profess more now than
[02:24] I used to and you've been doing it for a
[02:26] long time as well is like the future of
[02:28] finance really is going to be
[02:29] programmable permissionless and much
[02:32] more increasingly decentralized. So
[02:34] great, those are all like um great words
[02:37] to use, but what you're already seeing
[02:39] in what I call global liquidity markets
[02:42] is that you're seeing a shift from
[02:43] institutions being the gatekeepers to um
[02:47] to the protocols.
[02:49] Um and you're already seeing those uh
[02:51] gatekeepers to protocols being the
[02:53] rails. So crypto and and I also think
[02:55] that crypto no longer is uh becoming
[02:58] more and more commonplace at least with
[03:00] folks like you and me or the folks that
[03:01] we talk to given the multiple hats that
[03:03] we wear um where it's just an asset
[03:05] class right like when you start used you
[03:07] used to think about equities and crypto
[03:08] separately you used to think about
[03:10] venture and private equity um public
[03:13] public and private separately which is
[03:14] fine u but I think when you when you
[03:16] think about crypto it's not just an
[03:18] asset class it's an infrastructure lay
[03:20] layer for global capital markets global
[03:23] liquidity I I think the second piece to
[03:24] that is um is you know over the last two
[03:28] to three years AI has started to
[03:30] automate a lot more of this right so now
[03:32] we can uh you don't you're no longer
[03:34] requiring armies of analysts or ops
[03:36] teams to think about what tokenization
[03:38] means right like it's it's like right
[03:39] from the beginning we can start thinking
[03:41] about how to value it where does it get
[03:43] created um how do you distribute it how
[03:44] it's owned and so access from everything
[03:47] from treasuries to talent in some cases
[03:50] um but if I was to break it down into
[03:52] themes around what we're all talking
[03:54] about now is that you have crypto as an
[03:55] infrastructure, AI and finance, DeFi and
[03:57] tokenization, open systems, which I
[04:00] think is really really important and
[04:01] then the hybrid trust model between
[04:04] traditional finance and what's happening
[04:05] in DeFi. So what does that really mean?
[04:07] Crypto infrastructure trading uh
[04:10] powering payment systems, identity,
[04:12] custody, credit, governance, AI and
[04:14] finance, what does that mean? Smarter,
[04:15] faster, leaner systems where one person
[04:18] can do multiple things from risk to
[04:19] research to customer experience. uh
[04:21] define tokenization, what does that
[04:23] really mean? Moving real world assets
[04:25] and functions onchain, right? So,
[04:26] private credit, private equity,
[04:28] treasuries, traditional equities, public
[04:29] equities, open systems, composability
[04:32] and interoperability. I think that's
[04:34] been left out for so long, which is I
[04:36] don't need to be on a siloed platform.
[04:38] The platform doesn't have to own my
[04:39] customer experience. And then we can
[04:42] really start talking about what's been
[04:43] changing in the ecosystem around the
[04:45] hybrid trust models, which is regulatory
[04:46] clarity plus decentralized primitives
[04:50] essentially.
[04:51] will and what I've sort of focused my
[04:53] day-to-day um thought process on is that
[04:55] it becomes mainstream adoption. When you
[04:58] look at how this infrastructure is
[05:00] changing, it does feel like uh the
[05:02] people have been very receptive to this.
[05:04] Obviously, things like Bitcoin, stable
[05:06] coins, etc. They have been uh uh kind of
[05:08] first to use that. I think it's one of
[05:10] the first technologies definitely in my
[05:11] lifetime and and maybe in a long time
[05:12] where the people adopted it before the
[05:14] institutions and the nation states and
[05:15] things like that. Uh but now it does
[05:17] feel like the nation states are starting
[05:18] to turn and say, "Hey, wait, this like
[05:20] Bitcoin crypto thing." Uh there's value
[05:22] there, right? And we saw this with the
[05:24] Bitcoin ETFs. Now you see it with like
[05:26] stable coins. You hear them talking
[05:27] about the fact that they want these
[05:28] people as customers or they'll let them
[05:30] use their assets when they're lending
[05:32] and and borrowing and things like that.
[05:34] But it still feels like they want to do
[05:36] things in their kind of gatekeeper
[05:37] centralized way. It's just like they
[05:39] look at the assets as like an input into
[05:41] that system. Whereas what you're talking
[05:43] about feels like an entirely new system
[05:44] that's like built being built in
[05:46] parallel. Is that how you kind of see
[05:47] that the two different worlds, you know,
[05:49] kind of interacting with these assets?
[05:52] Look, if you if you take a look at the
[05:54] internet and what happened there was
[05:57] there was a community and the way in
[06:00] which they thought about open protocols
[06:02] and open source. And there was a set of
[06:04] companies that said, "Okay, great. I'm
[06:05] going to take some of these open sources
[06:06] and create either closed communities or
[06:08] closed gate systems. Um or I've already
[06:11] got a gated system. So like how does the
[06:12] internet help me augment what that looks
[06:14] like? So you see that today by the way I
[06:15] don't necessarily think it's a bad
[06:16] thing. Um it's just that we're evolving
[06:19] and so traditional internet where we're
[06:21] evolving at a certain pace. I think
[06:22] what's great about like the future of
[06:24] finance and the crypto ecosystem is that
[06:26] we can work at a much more compounding
[06:27] rate. Um and we can do it much more uh
[06:30] segmented um for where it makes the most
[06:32] sense. So when I think about you know
[06:34] with my hat on for for Kraken um is that
[06:38] look the I think for for how we think
[06:40] about the world is the end state for
[06:42] Kraken is to become a financial OS of
[06:44] the internet. I know that sounds fun,
[06:45] you know, crazy. Um, but like you should
[06:48] be able to think about what is a global
[06:50] platform that powers everything from
[06:52] trading, custody, payments, identity,
[06:53] real world assets, and issuance look
[06:55] like to not be gatekeepers, but to be
[06:57] able to enable innovation, right? Like
[06:58] AWS helped to enable a lot more
[07:00] innovation. They weren't gatekeeping
[07:02] along the way, you know, as opposed to
[07:03] what, you know, IBM used to do in the
[07:05] past. Um, and and another, you know, a
[07:08] counter to that would be like, okay,
[07:10] well, Facebook isn't just a social
[07:11] network. They're they at in the
[07:13] beginning at least they were helping to
[07:15] enable what social networking could be
[07:17] um with their social layer and identity
[07:19] but they became much more closed
[07:21] ecosystem and so and I would say it
[07:22] didn't come into fruition. So when I
[07:24] think about Kraken isn't just an
[07:25] exchange. If we're just an exchange,
[07:27] we're going to be a closed system. We're
[07:29] continuing to build the same
[07:31] infrastructure we built for ourselves to
[07:32] make Kraken successful. Um so that you
[07:34] can have an open programmable financial
[07:36] system. I think that's really important
[07:37] where it ends up being userowned that
[07:40] maybe that's a hybrid over a period of
[07:42] time. But then when you can think about
[07:43] being globally accessible and natively
[07:45] digital, that changes the way in which
[07:47] you can build products. And so then
[07:49] you're not building a platform, you're
[07:50] able to build products on top of an
[07:52] infrastructure. And then you can get a
[07:53] different kind of network effect or
[07:55] extensibility or user development
[07:57] ecosystems which we haven't seen before
[07:59] where the barrier of entry to build a
[08:02] product should be small. It shouldn't be
[08:04] that large. Um and you could say hey the
[08:07] history repeats itself and it you know
[08:08] these moes are created but ideally we
[08:10] can get to a place where it's less and
[08:12] less moes and it's more about can you
[08:14] build uh products that are at an even
[08:17] level playing field for you know what's
[08:19] best for the customer at the end of the
[08:20] day. Um, so you should be thinking about
[08:23] multiasset, multi- rail. You should be
[08:24] thinking about not just owning the
[08:26] stack, but owning the experience for a
[08:28] customer, but still making it
[08:29] permissionless, which is I want to be
[08:31] able to move. I want to be able to be
[08:32] mobile. I want to be able to own my
[08:34] asset the same way, which is probably
[08:36] what attracted you to Bitcoin or the
[08:37] Bitcoin paper is that like it's, you
[08:39] know, synonymous to cash in terms of
[08:41] like you owning it. It's yours. No one
[08:43] can touch it. And so you don't have to
[08:45] think about um a trade-off. you can
[08:47] think about, you know, what can I do now
[08:49] with my collateral? Um, and then what
[08:52] are the systems that I use? And and of
[08:53] course then you can move into, okay,
[08:55] well, what does traditional finance type
[08:57] products allow you to do that is trust
[08:59] um trusted and compliant. Um, and you're
[09:02] not thinking about trade-offs for
[09:04] compliance, you're thinking about
[09:05] advantages. One of the things that I've
[09:07] heard people talk about that I think is
[09:08] uh pretty interesting is this like
[09:09] operating system for finance and having
[09:11] it be this like open protocol that
[09:13] anyone can kind of uh play with and and
[09:15] uh plug into as you're describing here.
[09:17] We've seen this model, right? We've seen
[09:19] like the Apples of the world or the
[09:20] Androids and some of them more open than
[09:21] others and there's all these kind of
[09:23] different ways to do it. But we've also
[09:24] seen with like the app stores and so is
[09:26] that kind of what these financial
[09:27] institutions become is like they've
[09:29] created their own app and they're
[09:30] plugging it into a system but it doesn't
[09:32] matter if I've got you know PayPal,
[09:34] Venmo, Kraken or JP Morgan. I can go and
[09:37] I can send these assets between all
[09:38] these different products whether I'm
[09:40] talking about currency, commodities, you
[09:42] know, equities uh or or anything else.
[09:46] Look, I think the beauty of the early
[09:48] internet um was that there were so many
[09:51] open protocols that could have been
[09:52] used. Um and so we ended up choosing a
[09:54] few and some were, you know, deemed
[09:55] illegal during the mid to late '90s,
[09:57] especially when it came to sending money
[09:59] over the internet. Uh but but I think
[10:02] your your analogy is apt in that look,
[10:05] why is Venmo and
[10:08] um you know, PayPal two separate
[10:10] systems? Like why can't I use Venmo to
[10:12] send something to PayPal? you can't even
[10:14] though they're owned by the same company
[10:15] today. Um same thing with Cash App or
[10:18] any other protocol that's out there and
[10:19] and and I would say like the the beauty
[10:21] of what you've been able to see with
[10:23] crypto is like you have you know across
[10:25] all these changes that you start
[10:26] thinking about interoperability and
[10:28] composability. There is no reason. So
[10:30] the best analogy for kind of what it
[10:32] could look like is think about email
[10:34] which is like you're focused on one
[10:36] experience and that experience helps you
[10:38] win um customer experience and that
[10:41] allows you to be able to you know chat
[10:43] with you know pmpp.com um and like
[10:47] arjungmail.com or something like that
[10:48] right and we're allowed to be able to
[10:50] communicate with each other even though
[10:51] we're on different platforms and and I
[10:53] think that protocol level um
[10:55] composability is really important so
[10:57] when you start thinking about the bigger
[10:58] ambition for for financial assets is you
[11:02] know even the vision of what we have at
[11:04] Kraken is like okay you got a single
[11:05] platform to access every financial asset
[11:07] but you don't have to be closed there
[11:09] and homed there only where you can only
[11:11] do things within what we do that
[11:13] actually creates more friction so when
[11:15] you think about crypto plus FX or
[11:17] treasuries or real real world assets all
[11:19] in one place on one exchange it
[11:22] shouldn't be though that like you cannot
[11:23] move it and some a lot of people say
[11:25] well you know I can move Fidelity to
[11:26] Vangard that's really hard you can move
[11:28] from Morgan and Stanley Bank it's very
[11:30] hard like I've done it and it's painful
[11:32] and so that friction shouldn't be there
[11:34] in the case so the the bigger ambition
[11:36] for anyone including what we think about
[11:38] is how do you make access permissionless
[11:41] that means moving beyond just like
[11:42] listing and custody but you're able to
[11:45] move towards something creating more
[11:46] open composable financial infrastructure
[11:48] architecture where anyone can build
[11:50] trade issue settle without needing um
[11:52] some sort of approval from a central
[11:54] authority and central authority doesn't
[11:56] mean government central authority
[11:57] sometimes just means the bank, right?
[11:59] And I and I think that's what it means
[12:01] to being able to unify scale with
[12:02] decentralization.
[12:04] Talk a little bit about you guys going
[12:06] into US equities because I think that
[12:07] there's a lot of people who realize like
[12:09] the traditional financial folks of
[12:10] course they want to have the crypto, you
[12:12] know, ecosystem come to them. So you see
[12:14] the Bitcoin ETFs, you see uh different
[12:16] exchanges talking about maybe one day
[12:17] they could offer the crypto spot assets.
[12:20] Um we obviously have seen the futures
[12:21] and all that kind of stuff, you know,
[12:23] come out. Um, but I don't think people
[12:25] really ever thought about or or saw that
[12:27] it was going to be early where the
[12:29] crypto players were going to start
[12:30] adding the traditional assets uh and
[12:32] maybe beat the traditional players to
[12:34] kind of this merged world. Um, I always
[12:37] use you guys as the example as a
[12:39] traditional crypto exchange now adding
[12:40] US equities like game on it feels like.
[12:43] And so talk through maybe a little bit
[12:44] what you guys are doing and kind of why
[12:46] you're choosing to start with US
[12:47] equities.
[12:48] So this goes back a little bit in
[12:50] history where look when people talk
[12:53] about being internet native, mobile
[12:55] native, cryptonative, AI native, but I
[12:58] think what's really important is like
[12:59] when you are first principles native
[13:01] with a new paradigm shift. Um you're
[13:04] starting to build what you think the
[13:05] future may look like, but a lot of what
[13:06] the future may look like is coming from
[13:08] what I call past architecture, past
[13:11] traditions and and past assets. So um
[13:15] given my background, I spent so much
[13:16] time in fintech um as an investor and
[13:18] and built our own companies as well and
[13:20] and I started a bank in Mexico called
[13:22] Capitol. One of the biggest issues with
[13:24] building those companies is because
[13:26] we're building on traditional
[13:27] infrastructure, it's it's actually
[13:28] harder and harder for us to be able to
[13:31] move and think about um how to build new
[13:34] financial rails and financial
[13:35] technologies cuz you've got this debt of
[13:37] all of this investments that you've made
[13:39] in the past. Um, and so you'll see
[13:41] people talk about that actually, which
[13:42] is like, well, we do this. It's like
[13:44] it's cheap to be able to move money
[13:46] around. Great. It's well with for your
[13:48] own infrastructure. I think there was a
[13:49] quote by one of the founders of Airwalks
[13:52] where he said like, I don't understand
[13:53] crypto. I don't understand why anyone
[13:54] would want to use it because like my
[13:56] products and the infrastructure we built
[13:58] is allows you to be able to move, you
[13:59] know, uh, uh, money, you know,
[14:01] instantaneously. Great. Well, if you use
[14:03] his platform, right? So, you got
[14:06] to pay the gatekeeper. Um, the flip side
[14:09] of it is, okay, great. Well, we're a
[14:10] crypton native company. We built out the
[14:12] rails and the infrastructure. Um, and so
[14:14] what does it mean to be able to go and
[14:16] get the traditional assets because
[14:18] they've already spent a lot of time
[14:19] building it and you know, rightfully so,
[14:21] like we uh bought Ninja Trader. The the
[14:24] the future of Ninja Trader is to be able
[14:26] to tokenize all of those uh contracts um
[14:28] and to be able to token whatever the
[14:30] commodities are that people want to be
[14:31] able to trade and how to think about
[14:32] that collateral. So our first foray into
[14:35] it is that like look, we support um uh
[14:39] tokens and we support a lot of assets on
[14:41] our exchange, but we need to be able to
[14:43] support more than just um you know
[14:45] cryptonative assets. We need to be able
[14:46] to figure out how to make crypto sorry
[14:49] traditional assets crypto native in
[14:50] themselves. And so we announced
[14:52] tokenized stocks when they called we
[14:53] call them X stocks. Um and and I think
[14:56] what we're really saying is like we're
[14:57] hinting at a world where you can trade
[14:59] any asset anytime from anywhere and the
[15:01] real value isn't just faster access to
[15:03] equities. The value is collapsing the
[15:05] layers of friction. So what are those
[15:07] friction points? Custody, settlement,
[15:09] access, compliance, all abstracted into
[15:12] code ideally. So for Kraken, it's a step
[15:14] forward in order to have a unified
[15:16] market structure where traditional and
[15:17] crypto assets can coexist not just on
[15:20] one single platform but across all the
[15:22] multiple platforms that are out there.
[15:23] Right? When I say permissionless, you
[15:25] can use any other exchange. You can use
[15:26] any other service provider. You should
[15:28] be able to use any wallet. It doesn't
[15:29] have to sit with me. But we want to be
[15:31] able to help enable that. And so for the
[15:34] world, what does that mean? It's
[15:36] billions locked out of global markets
[15:38] traditionally. So you you that means
[15:40] they don't have that financial
[15:41] inclusion. Um and programmable ownership
[15:44] can be a reality. 24/7 liquidity in
[15:46] collateral can be a reality. And you
[15:48] have borderless access. So I think you
[15:51] know like yes you need to get better at
[15:53] smarter compliance yes you need to have
[15:55] next generation user experience just
[15:56] like other fintexs have but I just think
[15:59] um making sure that you have access and
[16:01] composability you know it's it's where
[16:03] you can start thinking about what xox or
[16:05] you know we recently bought ninja trader
[16:08] how you plug that into defi and lending
[16:10] and structured products etc like that
[16:12] becomes the real in my opinion Trojan
[16:14] horse for crypton native companies to
[16:16] start thinking about bringing
[16:17] traditional assets into a programmable
[16:19] finance Once you're on chain, we get to
[16:21] build more innovation on top of that,
[16:22] which is what is more exciting rather
[16:24] than thinking about the bridge that
[16:26] we're trying to build. Now, how do you
[16:28] think about in this like open
[16:29] permissionless system? Uh I think the
[16:31] critics we deal like, oh my god, they're
[16:33] all going to trade, no one's going to
[16:34] have any rules, there's not going to be
[16:35] any regulation. How are we going to stop
[16:36] the bad actors? Um obviously, I think
[16:39] there's a whole critique of, you know,
[16:41] does things like KYC actually stop the
[16:43] bad actors and all that, but just put
[16:44] that aside for a second. How do you see
[16:46] what I would put as like innovative
[16:48] technology interacting with or
[16:50] intersecting with uh kind of an you know
[16:52] one of the most regulated industries in
[16:53] the world in terms of traditional
[16:55] finance? Today's episode is brought to
[16:57] you by Bitizenship. If you're a
[16:59] Bitcoiner thinking about global mobility
[17:01] and securing a true plan B, listen up.
[17:04] Portugal is one of the most attractive
[17:05] golden visa programs in the world. And
[17:07] Bitizenship has built the ideal pathway
[17:10] to get you there. They're behind the
[17:12] first Bitcoin ecosystem golden visa
[17:14] fund. It's a private equity fund that
[17:16] purchases Bitcoin via a local company
[17:18] that gives you exposure to Bitcoin while
[17:20] qualifying you for the Golden Visa and
[17:22] citizenship in just 5 years. Plus,
[17:25] here's what makes this a no-brainer.
[17:27] Bitizenship has the lowest fee structure
[17:29] of any Golden Visa fund in Portugal. And
[17:32] because their team handles everything
[17:33] in-house, you skip the usual friction
[17:35] and bloated fundraising costs of other
[17:37] funds. So, if you're serious about
[17:39] sovereign flexibility, now's the moment
[17:41] to act. Go to bitisenship.com/pump
[17:44] and book a free strategy call with their
[17:46] team. Again, that's bitansenship.com/p.
[17:50] Go check them out today. Look, the
[17:54] when regulations were passed for any of
[17:55] these um they usually work for good good
[17:58] reason. And then what happens is design
[18:00] pre-implementation ends up failing
[18:02] somewhere. So when you when you think
[18:04] about okay well does KYC AML work? Yes,
[18:06] it works for a very specific set of
[18:07] industries of like you know a movement
[18:09] of money but it doesn't work for cash.
[18:11] um it still doesn't work for you know
[18:12] different uh nefarious activities even
[18:14] in traditional banking. So I'll give you
[18:15] an example. Um you have someone like
[18:19] HSBC or any of the larger banks and
[18:21] institutions that they work with someone
[18:22] when when they find out that they've
[18:24] done something wrong, it's usually that
[18:26] they've been doing something wrong for 2
[18:27] years, right? And you're talking about
[18:28] billions and billions of dollars being
[18:30] moved um in um uh and and then now they
[18:33] have to go through an effort of
[18:34] reporting it then doing more
[18:35] investigation and obviously paying a
[18:37] fine eventually. If you take a look at
[18:39] the total, you know, amount of fines
[18:41] that the large institutions pay because
[18:43] they took so long to figure it out. I
[18:45] mean, it's in the hundreds of billions
[18:46] worldwide. It's it's large. I can't I
[18:48] can't even fathom what it is. I used to
[18:50] track it, but I stopped caring because
[18:51] it's just too large. What happens in
[18:53] crypto? One, you can start thinking
[18:56] about smarter compliance rather than an
[18:58] interpretation of compliance or manual
[19:00] compliance. So there's no reason why KYC
[19:02] and AML cannot move onchain and you
[19:05] cannot while you cannot um enforce the
[19:07] rules program programmatically right so
[19:10] you make it permissionless but in order
[19:11] to redeem in order to use in order to
[19:13] use in collateral for different products
[19:14] that are out there you can enforce these
[19:17] programmatically and it actually makes
[19:18] it easier not harder so imagine a world
[19:21] where you let in more people and then
[19:23] you can target rather than say like I'm
[19:26] just going to not let everyone
[19:27] participate in it you're talking about
[19:28] billions of people left on the sidelines
[19:30] worldwide, which is what crypto is now
[19:32] supposed to help enable because you're
[19:34] interpreting it manually like, you know,
[19:36] post World War II where you need like an
[19:38] army of a thousand people to figure it
[19:39] out. You don't need to, you know, it's
[19:41] getting easier and easier to do this
[19:43] every single day. Um there's no reason
[19:45] why we need to, you know, go back in
[19:47] time and say like, well, this is the way
[19:48] the the way in which the structure needs
[19:50] to be created. And when you see these
[19:53] assets um that are being tokenized,
[19:55] there's like infrastructure and then
[19:56] there's the players. How do you see the
[19:58] issuers changing over time? Like
[20:00] obviously somebody's building a company.
[20:02] Uh maybe they want a token and they want
[20:03] a publicly traded stock or maybe that's
[20:05] just one thing, but like the issuer role
[20:07] I think a lot of people don't really
[20:09] talk about because they talk about like
[20:10] the technology provider on the crypto
[20:11] side, talk about the banking or you know
[20:14] the the exchange or whatever in the
[20:15] traditional world, but the issuer in a
[20:17] weird way has choice and that choice
[20:20] should actually lead to competition
[20:22] between these two different systems to
[20:23] like who gets the issuer, right? It's
[20:24] like the next great company. Do they
[20:27] choose to tokenize themselves or or go
[20:29] through the traditional public markets?
[20:30] I think right now the default is public
[20:32] markets, but like maybe that changes
[20:34] over time. I think what's really
[20:38] fascinating is when you reduce the
[20:40] friction across the board, you're giving
[20:42] people ultimately more choice. And then
[20:44] when you have more choice, there's more
[20:46] innovation and products that are built
[20:47] on behalf of that. So who's the client
[20:50] at the end of the day? Let's call it,
[20:51] you know, um a company in Europe. Now,
[20:54] how do they get access to liquidity or
[20:56] global liquidity or access to capital?
[20:58] They got to go to their local exchange.
[21:01] Well, can you name me which um exchange
[21:04] that they're going to go to in Europe?
[21:06] You can't anymore because it's just
[21:08] getting smaller and smaller. So, they
[21:10] want access to global liquidity. And so,
[21:11] now everyone kind of looks like looks to
[21:13] the US markets for global liquidity. Um,
[21:15] now I think that's that can still be
[21:16] okay, which is okay, great. Now, you've
[21:18] got a a couple of exchanges that are
[21:19] thinking about global liquid liquidity,
[21:21] but they all interact with each other,
[21:22] too. So it ends up not being zero sum.
[21:25] And so as an issuer um you can decide
[21:28] how you want to think about your onchain
[21:30] strategies maybe a better way to put it
[21:32] which is do you want to be an issuer
[21:34] yourself? Do you want to work with
[21:35] someone else? Do you want access to a
[21:36] very specific set of global liquidity um
[21:39] uh products? Is it a treasury? Um is
[21:41] that credit? Um is that funds focused on
[21:43] DeFi and Trafi? Is it like I just want
[21:46] to issue a token that is my equity and
[21:49] do I want to have access to for global
[21:51] liquidity to be able to invest in my um
[21:53] you know traditional security? I think
[21:56] where people kind of get um mixed up is
[21:58] that tokenization isn't about wrapping.
[22:00] It's about rewiring what the back end of
[22:03] global finance is going to look like.
[22:04] Now is that going to happen today? Is
[22:06] going to happen tomorrow? Is going to
[22:07] happen like 10 years later? That's hard
[22:09] to predict, but it's already starting to
[22:12] make moves in that direction. And so I
[22:14] just think it becomes more and more
[22:15] natural where you're giving choice to
[22:17] the issuer. And now the question ends up
[22:19] being who is the issuer? Is it the
[22:20] company? Is it the or is it like the
[22:23] broker or is it the exchange? Like how's
[22:25] that infrastructure going to come into
[22:27] place? And so when you have this um
[22:29] mishmash now between what I call pro
[22:32] programmable onchain structure and
[22:35] traditional private contracts, that's
[22:38] where more and more innovation is going
[22:39] to happen. Right? So like we're already
[22:40] pushing this to try to figure out what
[22:42] does that look like? Um but you know
[22:44] it's going to be different in every
[22:45] market and it's why you know I think
[22:47] when you see the um macro realignment
[22:51] then you're going to see what are the
[22:52] types of products that you can have in
[22:53] there and look the fact that Bitcoin and
[22:55] Ethereum are basically the natural um
[22:58] liquidity pipeline for everyone to come
[23:00] in and then the stable coins is be the
[23:02] next piece of those global liquidity
[23:03] rails. we're just going to be able to be
[23:05] much more unified in my opinion like as
[23:07] in the financial layer and like in the
[23:09] connective tissue and I and I think
[23:11] that's where crypto is best served
[23:13] versus where we are today in a
[23:14] fragmented world with all of these
[23:16] middlemen and uh friction points across
[23:18] the board. I'm not saying any of these
[23:19] things are bad. It's just it's kind of
[23:21] where we are today. I think that there's
[23:23] a very uh good lesson in circle and in
[23:27] tether. Uh it seems like Tether's
[23:29] strategy is to go to the emerging
[23:31] markets and they're like, "Hey, the US
[23:32] already has dollars. Like we're going to
[23:34] go try to onboard a bunch of other
[23:35] people." Circle is saying, "Hey, we're
[23:37] going to be uh a regulated US-based
[23:39] stable coin. We're going to go get
[23:40] distribution through the Coinbases and
[23:42] other exchanges in the world, and we
[23:44] want to bring this digital dollar to
[23:47] kind of regulated finance, etc." I don't
[23:49] think either strategy is right or wrong.
[23:51] I think they're just very different
[23:52] strategies. When I think of things like
[23:54] tokenized stocks and maybe other things
[23:56] of a degree of sophistication, it feels
[23:59] like the demand is probably already most
[24:01] existent inside the United States or
[24:03] kind of traditional western capital
[24:04] markets, but to your point you mentioned
[24:06] earlier, there's billions of people who
[24:07] it's outside of the system and probably
[24:09] would love to get access. How do you
[24:11] think about, you know, which market to
[24:12] attack or or like what is the sequence?
[24:15] Uh because you probably can't serve
[24:16] everybody all at once because there are
[24:18] kind of different users with different
[24:19] product needs.
[24:22] Yeah. So there's multiple questions in
[24:24] that. So I'll I'll try to I'll try to
[24:27] tackle it one by one. Look, I think
[24:29] maybe a good way to put it is the world
[24:31] is merging multiasset and multiolateral
[24:33] based markets. And so we're watching the
[24:35] conversion of traditional finance and
[24:37] crypto in real time. We just talked
[24:38] about it. Um and so you have BTC, ETH,
[24:41] stable coins, tokenized treasuries, and
[24:43] equities. They all they all can and have
[24:45] been serving collateral across um a set
[24:48] of integrated financial systems. Um and
[24:50] so what do we really care about at the
[24:52] end of the day? We care about u market
[24:54] stability. We care about price. We care
[24:55] about utility. What assets can you
[24:57] borrow against? How do you settle with?
[25:00] Um how do you embed right frankly into
[25:02] smart contracts? That's what we think
[25:03] about in crypto. And then what's the
[25:05] shift of store of value, which is what
[25:07] we've been used to uh to infrastructure
[25:09] of value. And I think that ends up being
[25:11] probably more important around what we
[25:12] want to be able to build. I think circle
[25:14] and tether and all these other guys play
[25:16] a very specific piece of it right which
[25:18] is okay what does that plumbing allow
[25:20] you to do is that a wrapper or not right
[25:21] obviously you know there's always been
[25:23] the great debates around algorithmic
[25:25] versus you know back being backed one to
[25:27] one depending on what that is I think
[25:30] you go back to the basics what is
[25:32] tokenization is an infrastructure again
[25:33] not a wrapper it's a rearchitecture of
[25:35] financial plumbing it removes friction
[25:37] again custody settlement compliance
[25:39] issuance that's kind of what striped it
[25:41] did it for payments right and I think
[25:42] that's what we can do for worldwide
[25:44] capital markets. Real innovation isn't
[25:46] the tokens, it's going to be the rails
[25:47] they continue to run on. Um, so like
[25:50] think instant settlement again, 24/7
[25:53] programmable ownership, global access.
[25:55] This becomes like the default. This
[25:57] isn't the default in Argentina. This
[25:59] isn't the default in Brazil. It's isn't
[26:01] the default most of Latin America. It's
[26:03] not the default in India. It's not the
[26:04] default in most of the merging markets
[26:07] or even the um, you know, markets that
[26:10] we're just starting to think of like in
[26:11] Africa. When you think about global
[26:12] capital markets, um, you're only
[26:14] thinking about a couple places. You're
[26:16] thinking about Nigeria, Kenya, South
[26:19] Africa, and a couple places I'm probably
[26:21] missing. That's there's still a billion
[26:23] people that are being um uh not
[26:25] attributed. And so what what do they
[26:27] want access to? It again, it goes back
[26:28] to what I just mentioned is that
[26:30] tokenization is just isn't a wrapper.
[26:32] It's like a rearchitecture of the
[26:33] financial plumbing. And so what do they
[26:34] want access to? So they want access to
[26:37] clear assets where they can have savings
[26:40] and yield. So going back to your
[26:41] question around Circle, Circle's a solid
[26:43] company, right? What they're what
[26:44] they've been building, I I kind of think
[26:46] of it as a small to medium mid-market
[26:48] and enterprise. And Circle within the US
[26:50] had been focused on uh the upper stack
[26:52] of mid-market and enterprise, which is
[26:54] it's important um for those set of folks
[26:57] that want to think about bridging the
[26:58] gap between what they do in traditional
[27:00] finance. Think Franklin Templeton, think
[27:01] Black Rockck, those folks. Um which is
[27:04] very different where from what I'd
[27:06] consider like, you know, like a Stripe
[27:07] or a Tether um or a Visa, right? like uh
[27:09] really early on which is like okay small
[27:11] to medium mid-market and how do you grow
[27:13] bottoms up at a um and and think about
[27:16] how to realize performance for who their
[27:18] customers might be. I I think the thing
[27:20] that I found most fascinating cuz I
[27:21] travel the world a lot. It's like look,
[27:24] you go to Latin America and you go to
[27:26] their version of the farmers market.
[27:28] It's not as cool as it is here in like
[27:30] the Bay Area, but when you're going to
[27:32] where people are buying things daily,
[27:34] they are priced in USDT, right? They're
[27:37] not priced in their local currency.
[27:38] They're priced in USDT. And USDT is
[27:41] buying US treasuries. The natural form
[27:43] of what you're going to do if you're
[27:45] buying, selling, storing, and saving in
[27:48] USDT is thinking about investing in
[27:50] USDT. And the most natural things you're
[27:52] going to do is okay, where's global
[27:54] liquidity and what are the um uh
[27:56] traditional assets or safe assets or
[27:58] compounding assets that you want to
[28:00] invest into. And that and and I think
[28:02] that's what's really great is like those
[28:04] are most naturally companies and
[28:05] products and innovation that's happening
[28:06] in the United States. Um so around the
[28:09] circle IPO, like it's it's great. It's
[28:11] it's really early, solid company, solid
[28:13] traction. I think USDC and the the the
[28:16] likes of the stable coins around that
[28:17] type of IPO narrative and optionality
[28:19] are are really important. When you think
[28:21] about the public markets, obviously
[28:23] they've been very wellreceived there.
[28:24] Stock price has done incredibly well. Um
[28:27] I got to imagine that makes a bunch of
[28:28] other crypto companies say like, well,
[28:30] what if I get into the public market?
[28:31] Um, do you think that we'll see kind of
[28:33] this IPO, you know, backlog uh lead to
[28:36] an explosion that everyone is talking
[28:37] about or do you think that's overhyped
[28:39] and actually there's not as many
[28:40] companies trying to get into the public
[28:41] market as people believe? If you take a
[28:43] look at the do era, there's there's uh
[28:45] market cyclicality. You take a look at
[28:46] the dot era and what happened, you had
[28:51] um, you know, products that didn't have
[28:53] revenue but had a promise of possible
[28:55] revenue fly um, in the public markets,
[28:58] right? And people were investing behind
[28:59] it. I think you see these uh narratives
[29:01] all the time. You know what I call the
[29:03] abundance and the scarcity of the story
[29:05] and the abundance and scarcity of where
[29:06] we are in the capital markets. I think
[29:09] the public markets today and you can see
[29:11] it like you can just see the capital
[29:13] flows is uh they are investing into
[29:16] anything and everything that has a
[29:18] crypto narrative around it which I think
[29:20] actually could be quite dangerous right
[29:21] so ETFs IPOs um I think part of it is
[29:25] that there's a story around legitimacy
[29:28] and liquidity and there's a new investor
[29:29] base um but at the same time there's you
[29:33] know and and actually and and it's good
[29:35] because they are pressuring the system
[29:36] on the crypto side for better disclosure
[29:38] clear regulation, more robust
[29:40] infrastructure.
[29:42] Um, but at at a certain point, I think
[29:44] crypto has to stop being a side bet. Um,
[29:47] in terms of how you think about the
[29:48] global asset allocation model and it
[29:50] goes back into what I think about, you
[29:51] know, intrinsic value of what's actually
[29:53] happening. So, how do you scrutinize
[29:55] what's the maturity? What's the blending
[29:56] of your asset classes between what I'd
[29:59] say actually it shouldn't be a blend, it
[30:00] should be cryptonative and then all the
[30:02] assets underneath cryptonative. Um, and
[30:04] so I think the public markets are good
[30:07] for
[30:10] just producing more and more of that
[30:12] narrative, but I do think I get a little
[30:13] worried in that um, you are in this
[30:17] place where everything is being valued
[30:19] from an options value perspective versus
[30:21] intrinsic value. And I think you'll
[30:22] always have an equilibrium just like
[30:23] you've had in the past for certain types
[30:25] of assets. And so when I think about
[30:26] what we build and how we're thinking
[30:28] about the public markets, public markets
[30:30] are really more about, you know,
[30:31] bringing accountability more than
[30:32] anything else. And eventually um that
[30:34] that'll come more and more into these
[30:36] crypto companies that are not just hey I
[30:38] want to be a crypto treasury and you
[30:40] know for BTC ETH Salana etc but more
[30:42] about like how do you build value rather
[30:44] than just holding value. When um when
[30:46] you think about the Kraken business
[30:48] today my take is that you have uh some
[30:51] retail some institutions and uh that
[30:54] business is uh has evolved over time.
[30:57] When I look at the public markets I see
[30:59] retail institutions acting very
[31:00] differently. It's like every dip
[31:02] retail's buying hard. Institutions have
[31:04] been sitting on the line with much less
[31:06] equity exposure in the recovery this
[31:08] year uh than maybe they otherwise would
[31:09] have had, but retail has been a very big
[31:11] participant there. We can see the data
[31:13] points of like retail's ownership of uh
[31:15] stocks is you know at all-time highs
[31:17] etc. How do you all think about retail
[31:20] versus institutions and like do you
[31:21] focus on one or the other? Do you try to
[31:23] serve both or is there you know any
[31:25] delineation between those groups uh
[31:27] given the business you guys are running
[31:29] kind of where you think this uh finance
[31:30] world is going?

[32:34] Today's episode is brought to you by
[32:36] Core. You can earn yield on your Bitcoin
[32:38] by just holding your Bitcoin. It's
[32:40] simple. Core, the leading Bitcoin
[32:42] scaling solution, will reward you for
[32:44] not selling your Bitcoin. It's not
[32:46] magic. Here's how it works. Core is a
[32:48] protocol secured by elected validators.
[32:50] You can help elect validators and secure
[32:52] the network by simply locking up your
[32:53] Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain. No
[32:56] bridging, no lending, and just holding.
[32:58] When your validator secures core, it
[33:00] earns rewards fueled by network activity
[33:02] and passes them back to US yield. With a
[33:04] minimum lock up of just one day, when
[33:06] the time lock ends, you get your Bitcoin
[33:08] back untouched. Steal your keys, steal
[33:11] your coins, now your yield. For even
[33:13] higher rates, stake core alongside your
[33:15] Bitcoin and multiply your yield. And if
[33:17] you want to see what your Bitcoin is
[33:19] securing, join millions of others in
[33:20] exploring the largest Bitcoin DeFi
[33:22] ecosystem. There are over a 100 live
[33:24] apps in the network and the deepest
[33:26] liquidity in all of Bitcoin DeFi. Get

[33:42] How do you all think about retail versus
[33:44] institutions and like do you focus on
[33:46] one or the other? Do you try to serve
[33:47] both or is there you know any
[33:49] delineation between those groups uh
[33:52] given the business you guys are running
[33:53] kind of where you think this uh finance
[33:55] world is going?
[33:57] So the I mean the history of Kraken was
[33:59] that um Ton and Jesse were the two
[34:03] co-founders and they actually came from
[34:04] gaming and if you if you go back in time
[34:06] around gaming and and also they also
[34:08] built it off of the cusp of the uh Mount
[34:11] Gaus um event that had happened around
[34:14] um it being hacked right and so their
[34:16] premise was where can you build um a
[34:20] place that's institutional grade secure
[34:23] with deep liquidity regulatory
[34:25] resilience what they which I think is
[34:26] really important multiasset class like
[34:28] this is how they were thinking right off
[34:29] the bat and then leverage crypto rails
[34:31] to be able to bring it to everyone um
[34:33] and so the we we basically built an
[34:35] institutional grade engine exchange um
[34:38] for our clients. Now who are those
[34:40] clients that care about uh who we serve
[34:43] at um with depth and trust? It's
[34:45] professional traders. And so if you go
[34:47] back 20 years um actually even 30 years
[34:50] now um professional traders was just
[34:52] starting out right it's one of the
[34:54] reasons why we bought Ninja Trader as
[34:55] well is that in the in the mid200s um
[34:58] you had people being getting access
[35:00] obviously with the advent of the
[35:01] internet to their own trading view to be
[35:03] able to
[35:05] u take a look at how they wanted to
[35:06] trade their own assets and not having to
[35:08] rely on the broker or the middleman.
[35:10] Like we've seen this theme happen again
[35:12] and again and again. you know, every
[35:14] five or 10 years there's a new
[35:15] generation of the types of products you
[35:16] can have. Um, so there there were these
[35:18] gateways and these platform
[35:19] institutions. I think we we think of
[35:23] ourselves as being able to help enable
[35:25] more and more of that um independent
[35:27] thinking which is like what does a
[35:29] professional trader do? What do they
[35:31] care about? Well, they care about all of
[35:33] the assets, the all the ways in which
[35:35] they want to trade, um, store, save, and
[35:37] yield. Uh, but it's a it's at a
[35:39] different level, right? So if you think
[35:41] about some of the exchanges that are
[35:42] there today, you even here in the US, I
[35:44] think they've always been much even a
[35:46] fintech company that um u gives you the
[35:49] option to buy crypto, they're a consumer
[35:51] gateway. Um but they all have to rely on
[35:54] different um third party folks,
[35:56] institutional grade engines like us in
[35:58] some cases that serve both uh of that
[36:01] depth and trust. And so I think a way to
[36:04] I think a way to think about what we've
[36:05] built is we've built a set of
[36:07] microservices to be able to support our
[36:09] core business today. And we're building
[36:11] a new set of core services on top of the
[36:14] microservices that we've had in the
[36:15] past. And so when I when I talk about
[36:17] what's happening in DeFi, what is the
[36:19] hybridization, how do we make sure that
[36:21] we have a hybridization trust platform,
[36:24] that's really around what we're able to
[36:26] build because we first focused on our
[36:28] professional trading class and there are
[36:30] typically our counterparties to anything
[36:32] that we build. So when we think about
[36:33] payments, when we think about um uh uh
[36:37] uh DeFi products, when we think about uh
[36:39] the next set of institutional grade or
[36:41] retail products that we're going to
[36:42] build, we're going to be building it off
[36:44] of the back of our foundation that we
[36:45] have. And I think that's what's really
[36:46] important is that we don't sit on purely
[36:48] retail. We don't sit purely on
[36:50] institutional. We sit right in the
[36:51] middle, which is professional traders
[36:53] that want access to retail style
[36:54] products, but they also want access to
[36:56] institutional style products. And that's
[36:58] why we're able to build um our you know
[37:01] our multiasset access products at a at a
[37:03] pretty fast clip. Right. So when we
[37:04] think about the vertical ownership for
[37:07] our professional traders, we do think
[37:08] custody, settlement, trading, staking,
[37:10] indexing all in one stack on behalf of
[37:12] them. And and then from there, whatever
[37:14] else they want to do to explore what
[37:16] DeFi might there um provide them, but we
[37:19] want to be able to make sure that we can
[37:20] build um along the way with them as
[37:23] they're evolving as well, especially in
[37:25] the crypto ecosystem. My last question
[37:27] for you is around nation state uh
[37:28] participation. Obviously we've seen El
[37:30] Salvador, Bhutan, you know, many other
[37:32] countries uh participate, but usually
[37:34] they're pretty small kind of uh
[37:35] beneficiaries of the innovators dilemma.
[37:37] Uh now we have this uh strategic bitcoin
[37:40] reserve. You see many other countries
[37:41] that are either their sovereign wealth
[37:43] funds or their country themselves saying
[37:45] we're going to set up a strategic
[37:46] reserve. We're going to buy the Bitcoin
[37:47] ETS. We're going to participate in
[37:49] mining. You know, uh some of them
[37:50] probably are going to end up doing
[37:51] staking and you know many other various
[37:53] activities. How do you see that cohort
[37:56] playing into a lot of the stuff that
[37:57] we've talked about here? Um, you know,
[38:00] the US doesn't hold US equities on
[38:02] behalf of the citizens or anything like
[38:04] that. Uh, but it does feel like there's
[38:06] a significant shift now where like the
[38:08] countries are here. Uh, and that should
[38:10] change things in the market pretty
[38:11] drastically.
[38:13] Look, I think in order so I think that
[38:17] the way to sort of think about the
[38:18] themes has been a what's happening
[38:21] worldwide and then take a step back and
[38:23] and say okay what's the regulatory
[38:25] clarity you need for that type of what I
[38:27] call market stability. So what did we
[38:29] have in the US and the EU? We had FIT 21
[38:32] um which is a variant of what could
[38:33] become into law in the future when we're
[38:35] thinking about commodities versus
[38:36] securities the agency roles between the
[38:38] SEC and the CFTC. And so we label those
[38:41] today as market structure and the stable
[38:43] coin bill. Um in Europe they had the
[38:46] Miko roll out, right? And so it set a
[38:47] baseline in my opinion for others to
[38:50] follow rather than what you typically
[38:51] see the US and then for others to follow
[38:53] the US. Then on top of that um I I'd
[38:56] actually say that the ETF approvals were
[38:58] much more a force because you you were
[39:00] seeing um a baseline being sent outside
[39:02] the United States, right? So which as
[39:04] you'd mentioned it actually just further
[39:06] institutionalizes the space even more so
[39:08] that they had Right. So that so I think
[39:09] that clarity worldwide over a period of
[39:12] time then unlocks more innovation and
[39:15] the builders get ready and now there's a
[39:17] green light for them to build not just
[39:18] here in the United States but all over
[39:19] the world. Um, but I think what's more
[39:22] important to your question is that
[39:23] tokenization goes real, right? So
[39:24] onchain treasuries, credit funds used in
[39:27] DeFi and Trafi. You're seeing Black
[39:29] Rockck enter. You're seeing Frank
[39:30] Franklin Templeton enter. You're now
[39:32] seeing JP Morgan starting to think about
[39:34] scaling up, right? Which is like
[39:35] unfathomable two years ago. Um, and
[39:38] they're all talking about programmable
[39:40] compliance and new financial products
[39:42] and how they're able to bridge that gap.
[39:43] Um, I mentioned it before, right? Like
[39:45] tokenization isn't just going to be
[39:47] about wrapping. is going to be about um
[39:48] how do you rewire this with the
[39:50] traditional guys as well um you're
[39:52] seeing a large amount of geopolitical
[39:54] realignment I think this is really key
[39:55] right so US elections central bank
[39:57] shifts emerging market instability um
[40:00] stable coins are becoming more and more
[40:02] global liquidity rails not just here in
[40:03] the United States and for the United
[40:05] States but all over the world Bitcoin
[40:08] has become more and more of a strength
[40:09] as a neutral reserve inflation hedge
[40:11] you've talked about this a lot right
[40:13] like and I'm sure people thought you
[40:14] were crazy 5 years ago when you're
[40:16] talking about it now it becomes much
[40:17] more common place and so again in this
[40:19] fragmentation um you're seeing this
[40:21] connective tissue happening and and I
[40:23] think a lot of these countries are
[40:24] recognizing it at a faster and faster
[40:26] pace. So you said small nation states
[40:28] but I also think about emerging markets
[40:30] say like I spent a lot of time in India
[40:32] and uh in the Southeast Asia corridor
[40:34] they know people um are using crypto and
[40:38] they know what crypto will mean moving
[40:39] forward but the nation I would say the
[40:41] nation state participation is still
[40:42] pretty early and I would still say it's
[40:44] uh skeptical. It's kind of how people
[40:45] used to think about electricity as
[40:47] nefarious like why would you want to
[40:48] stay up at you know 11:00 at night? You
[40:50] must be doing something wrong. I do
[40:52] think that narrative still exists for
[40:53] crypto and it's probably you it's up to
[40:55] us and folks like us and companies to
[40:57] continually talk about what this
[40:59] actually means for multi-product
[41:00] multiasset multiolateral but uh
[41:03] strategic Bitcoin reserve is like the
[41:05] the notion that people are talking about
[41:07] today and and I think they're using and
[41:10] I don't know if this is right or wrong
[41:11] but they're using it in the same way
[41:12] they think about oil reserves in the
[41:13] past you know over the last hundred
[41:15] years and so what are the oil reserves
[41:17] for digital economies so as you
[41:19] mentioned El Salvador has leaned in I do
[41:21] also think adversarial states and I
[41:23] don't know if this again if this is good
[41:24] and bad they're all experimenting with
[41:25] crypto rails right where they can do a
[41:27] wraparound sanctions and make sure that
[41:29] their economies can still be they can
[41:31] weather the storm depending on what it
[41:33] looks like between you know um uh
[41:35] different nation states against each
[41:37] other sovereign wealth funds we all know
[41:39] this dipping into cryptonative VC and
[41:41] infrastructure quietly I don't think
[41:43] they're very loud about it but I think
[41:44] the big move is going to continually be
[41:46] when you have merged major economies
[41:49] start using BTC as a macro hedge not
[41:51] just gold. I think the more and more
[41:53] that we see that it becomes more common
[41:55] place. Central blanks exploring or
[41:57] holding tokenized ETFs or tokenized FX
[42:00] as a part of the reserve
[42:01] diversification. I'm starting to hear
[42:03] people talk about it. I haven't seen it
[42:04] really happen. Um I think crypto is now
[42:07] also becoming a part of the national
[42:08] security conversation and energy
[42:10] strategy which is mining surplus energy
[42:13] etc. Um, so I think like look, I could
[42:15] go on and on about this, but the but the
[42:17] fact is that AI and crypto are the same
[42:21] conversation in the same room. AI is
[42:23] more sexy. Crypto is more like, okay,
[42:24] well that's boring, but the I I always I
[42:27] always go back to the major economies
[42:29] are starting to use BTC as a macro hedge
[42:32] and then not just gold. That means we're
[42:33] we've progressed way further than we
[42:35] ever thought we were going to have um
[42:38] progressed in the last 10 years. And
[42:39] that happened all over the last two
[42:41] years. Um, so BTC as a geopolitical
[42:44] asset I think is really important. Why?
[42:47] Censorship resistant, borderless neutral
[42:50] countries that have inflation risk or
[42:51] political instability. They're going to
[42:52] probably think about it. It might
[42:54] actually create more stability for their
[42:55] countries because it's a hedge. And then
[42:57] for the US, it's an edge, right? And
[42:59] they've already embraced it and and and
[43:01] I think that's the piece that's going to
[43:02] be really fascinating to watch in terms
[43:04] of is it a fight, is it an enablement,
[43:07] um, is it a collaboration? And so my
[43:10] point of view to the team and what we
[43:12] build is like look we've always seen
[43:13] crypto as a long game. Um everyone is
[43:16] entering it including the nation states
[43:18] and everything we've built for uh opens
[43:21] up you know the uh for an average
[43:24] individual. It opens up for a small and
[43:26] medium business opens up for a sovereign
[43:28] nation. It opens up all of those folks
[43:30] to be able to focus on what it means to
[43:32] be permissionless programmable um and
[43:34] and more importantly interoperable. I
[43:37] think um it just feels like we now have
[43:40] entered the second phase of uh of the
[43:43] rise of all this technology. So, it's
[43:44] super exciting. Um where can we send
[43:46] people to find you or learn more about
[43:47] Kraken if they want to uh start using
[43:49] the product? Okay. Well, Kraken, just go
[43:52] to Kraken.com. That's an easy one. Um in
[43:54] any country that you're you're coming
[43:56] from, it takes you to the to the local
[43:59] page. Uh for me, Twitter, LinkedIn, I
[44:01] think it's just Arjents. Um and it's
[44:04] easy to find me. Amazing. Well, thank
[44:06] you so much for taking the time to do
[44:07] this. As always, impressed by everything
[44:09] you guys are doing and wish you the best
[44:10] of luck and we'll definitely do it again
[44:11] in the future. Awesome.
