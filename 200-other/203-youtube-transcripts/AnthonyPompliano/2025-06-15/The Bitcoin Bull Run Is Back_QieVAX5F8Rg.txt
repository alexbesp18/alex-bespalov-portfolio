[00:00] What's going on, guys? Today we've got
[00:01] an excellent episode with John Pompiano.
[00:03] That's right, Johnny Jets is back and
[00:05] it's a great great conversation. In this
[00:08] one, we talk about what's going on with
[00:09] the macro environment, inflation, why is
[00:12] Doge waving the white flag. What about
[00:14] Bitcoin, the Bitcoin conference, all the
[00:16] Bitcoin Treasury companies, and how I
[00:18] think about learning from the past and
[00:20] taking timeless investing principles,
[00:21] but applying them to brand new places,
[00:24] both in industries and in your
[00:25] portfolio. We do our best to unpack
[00:27] what's happening in the world and also
[00:29] how it's going to impact your personal
[00:31] portfolio. So, I hope you enjoy this
[00:32] conversation with John Pompiano. All
[00:35] right, John, what's the first topic?
[00:37] What you got for us? What's going on?
[00:38] All right, let's talk about Bitcoin
[00:40] 110,000. Uh the Bitcoin crowd seems to
[00:42] be extremely excited about the price
[00:44] movement recently. We have the Bitcoin
[00:46] conference coming up here in Vegas this
[00:47] week. Uh what are your thoughts? Where
[00:49] are we within this cycle and within this
[00:51] calendar year for Bitcoin? classic
[00:53] Bitcoin price movement before the
[00:55] Bitcoin conference. So, if you think um
[00:57] you know coming up on a new all-time
[00:59] high, we're knocking on the door, break
[01:00] through, kind of chill right around that
[01:02] all-time high price. And uh people are
[01:04] excited because the Bitcoin conference
[01:06] is going on. David Bailey, BTC Inc.,
[01:08] they do a fantastic job every year. Uh
[01:10] I've read that 30,000 people
[01:14] 3000 30,000 people are headed to Vegas
[01:17] and they're all going to be there. I saw
[01:18] Peter Schiff, he had his nice little uh
[01:21] booth set up. he complained that
[01:22] everyone else had nicer booths than him.
[01:24] It's because gold price hasn't kept up
[01:25] with Bitcoin over the last decade. Um,
[01:27] but I do think that uh one there is a uh
[01:30] kind of evolution of the speaker set.
[01:32] You obviously have the hardcore
[01:33] Bitcoiners, people who have been around
[01:35] for, you know, a decade plus. Uh you've
[01:37] got a lot of finance folks that maybe
[01:39] otherwise wouldn't have gone to the
[01:40] Bitcoin conference, you know, five, six,
[01:42] seven years ago. Um and you got a lot of
[01:43] politicians and kind of people within
[01:45] the political realm that are going to
[01:46] the Bitcoin conference as well. And so I
[01:48] think that really the Bitcoin conference
[01:50] today is uh Bitcoin is just maturing.
[01:53] It's kind of growing up which a good
[01:54] sign for Bitcoin. It means that Bitcoin
[01:56] is being adopted by these new people,
[01:57] new cohorts, larger pools of capital,
[01:59] etc. And so naturally, Bitcoin's price
[02:01] is up. Now I do think though that
[02:03] there's also this uh belief that Bitcoin
[02:06] has gone from a contrarian asset to a
[02:10] consensus asset. And part of that you
[02:11] can see it with Wall Street now
[02:12] embracing it. Um but I think that's
[02:14] always a really important part. Everyone
[02:16] knows that, you know, doing something
[02:17] different in investing is really
[02:19] important and being right is really
[02:21] important, right? If you do something
[02:22] different but you're wrong, then you're
[02:24] just a dummy. Like, you're just wrong,
[02:26] you lose money. Um, but if you do
[02:28] something different and you're right,
[02:29] that's where potential returns can be.
[02:31] Um, but another part of that equation
[02:33] that usually gets left out of the
[02:34] conversation is you need an idea to go
[02:36] from contrarian to consensus because you
[02:39] need everyone else to eventually see
[02:41] what you saw early. And I think that's
[02:43] really what Bitcoiners are experiencing
[02:44] now is when you were buying Bitcoin, you
[02:47] know, 5 years ago, 10 years ago, uh what
[02:49] you saw were a lot of folks who were
[02:51] saying that's crazy. Why would you put
[02:53] your money in that thing? It's for drug
[02:54] dealers or criminals or the government's
[02:56] going to shut it down or it wastes too
[02:58] much electricity or whatever the thing
[02:59] was that they uh got scared away by.
[03:03] Well, the people who were buying
[03:04] Bitcoin, whether you were dollar cost
[03:06] averaging or or whatever you were doing,
[03:08] now that went from a contrarian thing to
[03:11] everyone else is like, well, I need some
[03:12] Bitcoin, too. And so, that shift from
[03:14] contrarian to consensus, really
[03:15] important. I think that also leads to
[03:17] kind of the higher price point is
[03:18] because it's kind of like the the meme,
[03:20] you know, hey, the water's warm, come on
[03:21] in. Right? Is the water was cold 5 years
[03:24] ago, 10 years ago. Now, it's warm. Now,
[03:26] everyone's like ready to rock and roll
[03:28] and they're going to come into uh to
[03:29] Bitcoin. So, I think you're starting to
[03:30] see that uh in a major way. How much of
[03:33] this is price action? Hey, look, price
[03:35] is going up. I want to be involved. It
[03:36] was contrary. Now it's consensus. And
[03:38] the reason that the price is going up is
[03:40] because it's becoming more of a
[03:41] consensus idea. Um versus, hey, the
[03:44] technology, what people are building on
[03:46] it is super exciting, right? Like why
[03:47] are 30,000 people going to the
[03:49] conference when last year when the price
[03:51] was down, not that not 30,000 people
[03:53] went? Yeah. Well, I think there's a
[03:54] couple of things. So, uh price in
[03:56] relationship to value is always a
[03:59] chicken or an egg, right? Does uh the
[04:01] network become more valuable and the
[04:02] price goes up or does the price go up
[04:03] and the network becomes more valuable?
[04:05] Um I would argue that one aspect or
[04:07] framework that I use is uh Bitcoin does
[04:10] not have a centralized executive team.
[04:12] It doesn't have a board of directors. It
[04:14] doesn't have a marketing budget. It
[04:15] doesn't have, you know, annual earnings
[04:17] reports. It doesn't have uh kind of uh
[04:19] these plans that are laid out for for
[04:21] folks, right? Um it is this
[04:23] decentralized network. And so the quote
[04:25] unquote marketing campaign is the price.
[04:27] And you see this, right? As the price
[04:29] goes up, what happens? People start to
[04:32] get more excited because they're holding
[04:33] Bitcoin. They start telling their
[04:35] friends. Their friends start asking them
[04:37] about it. Everyone, the word of mouth
[04:38] starts to spread among individuals. On
[04:41] top of that, you then get the media
[04:43] starting to write articles or do
[04:44] interviews or podcasts or whatever. So
[04:47] now you've got individual word of mouth
[04:48] spreading. You've got the media
[04:50] megaphones propagating the message on a
[04:52] broader basis. And then you have things
[04:54] like institutions or others who are
[04:55] saying, "Hey, the trade is working." And
[04:57] so they start to get this uh
[04:59] confirmatory uh kind of feedback from
[05:01] the market. And so they say, "Oh, I
[05:03] bought a little bit. It's working. Good
[05:05] investors, they press their winners
[05:07] hardest, right? So they're going to go
[05:08] put more capital into the trade." And so
[05:10] I think that when you look at those
[05:12] three things, it really is the price is
[05:15] the marketing campaign. Now, of course,
[05:17] the way I usually describe this is as
[05:19] price is going up, more people are
[05:20] coming in. Naturally, more capital is
[05:22] coming in that's leaving. So it's
[05:23] pushing the price further. Then we at
[05:25] some point will get overvalued, right?
[05:27] or or the price will go up too much. And
[05:29] so when that occurs, what will happen is
[05:31] the price will start to try to correct.
[05:33] It'll try to find some equilibrium. Now,
[05:35] some people will have bought Bitcoin on
[05:38] the way up. They'll have learned about
[05:40] Bitcoin. They'll become kind of these
[05:41] hardened, you know, uh long-term
[05:43] holders, and they will hold Bitcoin
[05:45] regardless of what happens with the
[05:46] price. But a lot of people, they're
[05:48] going to come into Bitcoin as a
[05:50] get-richqu scheme towards the end of
[05:52] that bull market when the price is
[05:53] really kind of running. And when they
[05:55] come in, they're going to within a
[05:57] month, two months, three months, the
[05:59] price is going to correct and they're
[06:00] going to basically now be underwater on
[06:02] their Bitcoin. Some of those people will
[06:04] continue to hold. A lot of those people
[06:06] though will sell and say, "I'm never
[06:07] touching Bitcoin again." No different
[06:09] than if you have a mobile app and you
[06:10] run a marketing campaign and 100 people
[06:12] sign up. Well, if all of a sudden 100
[06:14] people signed up, how many of them are
[06:16] still around a month from now? Maybe 30
[06:18] of them, right? So, a 30% retention rate
[06:20] after one month. Great. Well, if you
[06:22] then run another marketing campaign for
[06:24] 100 people and you only are left with 30
[06:27] at the end of that next month, well, you
[06:29] only have 60 total users. You had one,
[06:31] you had 30 after the first month, 30
[06:33] after the second month. That's your
[06:34] retention rate. These 70 that are
[06:36] leaving from every single marketing
[06:37] campaign. That's the equivalent of the
[06:39] Bitcoiners who are buying at the top of
[06:40] the market. And when it corrects, they
[06:42] just say, "I'm I'm out of here. I don't
[06:43] understand Bitcoin. I was here for
[06:44] get-rich quick. I'm losing money. I
[06:46] don't want anything to do with this."
[06:47] And so I think that price is a marketing
[06:50] campaign, but the steeper the price
[06:52] acceleration, the better it is at
[06:54] marketing. And so I always get very
[06:57] nervous towards the ends of these cycles
[06:59] because what you see is a lot of people
[07:00] coming in who don't understand it, who
[07:02] aren't going to be long-term holders,
[07:04] and they're likely to get burnt. And so
[07:05] the best thing I found is uh just like
[07:08] any timeless investing principle, just
[07:10] dollar cost average into a great asset
[07:12] over a long period of time. And it
[07:13] doesn't matter if the price is up or
[07:15] down or sideways. Just keep dollar cost
[07:17] averaging and over time you get this
[07:18] nice beautiful blended thing. And if you
[07:20] hold for a long enough period of time uh
[07:22] pretty much everyone who's bought in the
[07:23] last four year or I'm sorry pretty much
[07:25] anyone who has bought Bitcoin at almost
[07:27] any time in its history and held till
[07:29] today is in profit, right? And that will
[07:32] continue to be true over the long run.
[07:33] And so like just let the market work for
[07:35] you rather than trying to outsmart the
[07:37] market. Did you see I saw an X that
[07:39] someone has uh leverage on Bitcoin where
[07:42] it could be liquidated at about 105
[07:44] uh,000. What are your thoughts about
[07:46] using leverage and just like is it
[07:47] propping up the market versus is it like
[07:49] a real sustainable uh price run that
[07:51] we're seeing? I saw the gentleman who's
[07:53] doing this. I think his name's James
[07:54] Win. Um I do not have the stomach nor
[07:59] the coonus to uh be out there with
[08:02] hundreds of millions of dollars of
[08:03] leverage, billion dollars, what some
[08:05] crazy number. um obviously that
[08:07] magnifies moves in an asset. And so if
[08:10] you're long and with a lot of leverage
[08:12] and it goes up, then great, you're going
[08:15] to make money. The same is true on the
[08:16] other side. And so, um, I think it is,
[08:19] you know, a very risky game. It's not a
[08:20] game I play. Um, but hey, if that that's
[08:22] your game, maybe you've got an edge or
[08:24] some sort of competitive advantage,
[08:25] knock yourself out, right? People should
[08:26] be free to do what they want with their
[08:28] money. Um, with that said, uh, I I've
[08:31] been loosely following I think he was up
[08:33] at one point like on a P&L basis like 85
[08:36] million bucks. That's life-changing
[08:38] money for pretty much almost anyone in
[08:39] the world and he, you know, couldn't get
[08:42] away from the table. And so, I think
[08:44] he's back down closer to like flat on
[08:47] his P&L. Now, again, if that's your game
[08:49] and you're used to wild swings, uh, you
[08:51] know, go talk to somebody who goes to
[08:53] Vegas. like, you know, I had some epic
[08:55] runs and I had some, you know, absolute
[08:57] heaters that ended in sorrow. Um, but on
[09:00] a net basis, I'm up or something like
[09:02] that right here. Uh, I don't know what
[09:04] the rest of his P&L looks like. I don't
[09:05] know what other trades he did, but on
[09:06] this specific kind of, you two, three
[09:08] week run, it seems like he's kind of
[09:09] flat. Um, and so in a weird way, uh,
[09:12] maybe it's just entertainment for him,
[09:14] right? Maybe he's just really excited.
[09:16] But, uh, being up 85 million bucks and
[09:18] then, uh, you know, going back down to
[09:20] uh, to flat is probably a tough pill to
[09:22] swallow. I don't care how much money you
[09:23] got. You know, people would rather have
[09:24] the 85 than the zero 100%. Um, let's
[09:27] talk about another Bitcoin buyer, which
[09:29] is DJT. They announced that they're
[09:31] going to buy $2.53 billion worth of
[09:33] Bitcoin. Uh, what are your thoughts
[09:35] around Trump's organization, or at least
[09:37] that DJT entity buying more Bitcoin and
[09:40] then doing it in such a large volume
[09:42] amount? Yeah, look, I think that um
[09:44] anytime that you have a company where
[09:46] the stock is trading at a very high
[09:49] premium to what would be considered like
[09:51] book value, then it is the duty of that
[09:56] executive team to figure out how to sell
[09:59] shares and raise capital, right? Any
[10:02] company, I mean, Warren Buffett, right?
[10:04] If we're overvalued, we should be
[10:05] raising capital. If we're undervalued,
[10:06] we should be buying back shares. That's
[10:08] kind of a traditional capital market
[10:09] exercise. Um, I think there's a lot of
[10:11] people who look at that company in
[10:12] particular. Um, I, you know, I've never
[10:14] talked to the team there or anything,
[10:15] but just from what I read online, um, it
[10:17] seems pretty overvalued, uh, given what
[10:19] their financial performance is. Now,
[10:21] there's reasons for that. There's
[10:23] obviously a very kind of engaged
[10:24] shareholder base, like all all the
[10:26] things that people will will analyze,
[10:27] but if you just look at how much
[10:28] revenue, how much profit, what's the
[10:29] market cap, you know, big gap, um, raise
[10:34] capital, right? So, like it's a very
[10:35] rational thing to do. Now, raising
[10:37] capital, you can do a lot of different
[10:39] things. you can go buy companies, you
[10:40] can reinvest in your business, you can
[10:41] go buy Bitcoin, whatever. And so they're
[10:44] uh it seems like from the reports going
[10:45] to buy Bitcoin. Um and so if you go and
[10:47] you buy $2 half billion worth of
[10:48] Bitcoin, um my guess is that that's
[10:51] probably over a long period of time, as
[10:52] long as you hold and you don't do
[10:53] anything crazy, uh it'll be worth more
[10:55] in the future. And so I think that
[10:57] that's what you're starting to see a lot
[10:58] of folks say to themselves is wait a
[11:00] second if I can use the public capital
[11:02] markets. I can raise capital and I can
[11:05] then deploy it into an asset that seems
[11:07] to be very resilient uh and long-term
[11:09] seems to be very attractive. Um what is
[11:12] the difference between if I said to you,
[11:13] you know, hey, they went and they raised
[11:15] capital and they're buying a business.
[11:17] The business has no cash flow, right?
[11:19] It's not losing money though either. But
[11:21] it continues to compound its equity
[11:23] value at, you know, 60% year-over-year
[11:25] and it's done that for a decade. You
[11:28] that's pretty interesting. Even if it
[11:29] comes down to 30%, it's probably still
[11:31] pretty attractive. Can we beat that
[11:33] hurdle rate? Right? Can we do better
[11:35] than 30 40 50 60% compound annual growth
[11:38] rate? Uh that's really hard to do. And
[11:40] so I think that's what you're seeing a
[11:41] lot of these public companies go
[11:42] through. Now, of course, this is going
[11:44] to get a lot of attention because of the
[11:45] relationship or or uh kind of
[11:47] correlation with uh with Trump and and
[11:49] his name. And so, I I'm not clear on
[11:52] what his actual ownership is or or his
[11:55] relationship, whatever. I'm I'm assuming
[11:56] he owns equity. Um and but I'm not sure
[11:59] also like how involved he is in in the
[12:01] management decisions like, you know, is
[12:02] he calling and he's like uh you know, in
[12:04] the big short he's like bye, right? I
[12:06] don't know. He was tweeting by right to
[12:09] uh to the people. um and and was uh uh
[12:12] eerily accurate in uh in doing that. It
[12:15] helps if you can uh tweet by and then
[12:17] strike a deal and announce it a couple
[12:18] hours later. Um but I think that it's
[12:21] again it, you know, it will get a lot of
[12:22] attention, but this is just kind of a
[12:24] rational position for uh a company like
[12:27] that to do. But also I think that a lot
[12:29] of people in the market, again I keep
[12:30] saying if you can't beat it, you got to
[12:32] buy it, right? And I think that um that
[12:34] has been true of the S&P 500 for a long
[12:37] time. people said, "Hey, if you can't
[12:38] beat it, you got to buy it." Right?
[12:39] Okay. Well, same thing here, I think,
[12:41] for this whole new generation, kind of
[12:43] the the internet age. Um, this is the
[12:45] benchmark. Um, and you're going to
[12:48] continue to see people say, "Hey, if I
[12:49] can't beat it, then let me go and put
[12:51] some on the balance sheet." At what
[12:52] point does that uh capitulate though?
[12:54] And like people are like, "Okay, like I
[12:56] have to buy Bitcoin." Because it still
[12:57] is a contrarian idea for most people and
[12:59] for most institutions. Um, so like there
[13:01] is a tipping point there, right? if it
[13:03] goes on another 20-y year bull run where
[13:05] we're up another million% over the next
[13:07] 20 years like people are you know is
[13:09] that the new benchmark and like when is
[13:11] that seen as the new benchmark versus
[13:13] you know traditional called ETFs S&P VO
[13:16] well let's flip this a little bit and
[13:18] talk about it from a different
[13:19] perspective which is um what's the risk
[13:22] here today's episode is brought to you
[13:24] by my partner Bitwise the global crypto
[13:26] asset manager Bitwise has $10 billion in
[13:28] client assets a team of 100 plus people
[13:31] and more than 30 crypto products
[13:33] One more thing, they've also got one of
[13:35] the best weekly newsletters in crypto. I
[13:38] say that as someone who's no stranger to
[13:39] newsletters. Take it from me. Bitwise's
[13:41] weekly CIO memo is dynamite. The weekly
[13:44] CIO memo is written by Matt Hogan, one
[13:46] of the best minds in the business. Matt
[13:48] has a knack for seeing the crypto
[13:50] stories that people are missing or
[13:52] digging a level deeper on things like
[13:53] the strategic reserve, corporate Bitcoin
[13:55] buying, or crypto price predictions. I
[13:57] highly recommend it. Matt's got some
[13:59] really smart and bold takes and a lot of
[14:01] wit. And the memo takes just 5 minutes
[14:03] to read each week. So head over to
[14:07] bitwiseinvestments.com/cio memo. That's

[15:39] zapobank.com/p today. Nobody wants to
[15:42] talk about the risks, right? Um, I do
[15:44] believe that a number of these companies
[15:47] are going to get overlevered in a way
[15:49] where they are going to basically spit
[15:51] back out the Bitcoin. So, you think
[15:52] about it, they're all sucking in the
[15:53] Bitcoin, right? But there's leverage.
[15:57] And so, people will do all kinds of
[15:59] calculations and they'll say, um, ah,
[16:01] you know, we need the Bitcoin price to
[16:03] go to X and then, uh, we would be in
[16:05] trouble, but X is a really low number.
[16:07] or they'll say uh oh our you know
[16:10] leverage ratio right now is only you
[16:12] know 5% or 10% whatever right people are
[16:16] way smarter than me are analyzing this
[16:18] stuff all I know is uh I'm a pretty
[16:20] simple guy if you have an asset that is
[16:23] highly volatile and in history multiple
[16:26] times has drawn down 80 85% and there's
[16:29] leverage involved at some point over the
[16:33] next 3 to four years dead bodies are
[16:35] going to float to the
[16:37] Right? They're going to float to the top
[16:38] of the water there. Who is it going to
[16:40] be? I don't know. Somebody smarter than
[16:41] me will figure that out. How is it going
[16:44] to happen? I don't know. Somebody that
[16:45] smarter than me is going to figure it
[16:46] out. But what I do know is if you are
[16:50] going to do this, you better do it with
[16:53] a minimal amount of leverage because
[16:56] that is ultimately the safe way to do
[16:57] it. Now, of course, it's like anything.
[17:00] If I tell you, hey, um, we can earn 5%,
[17:04] somebody else shows up, say, "Hey, we
[17:05] can earn 6%." Somebody else said I can
[17:06] earn 10, I can earn 15, I can earn 20.
[17:09] Where's the line? We don't know. Um, but
[17:11] I do think that uh being prudent in the
[17:15] public markets with this type of
[17:17] strategy will be a very strong positive
[17:21] uh kind of a creative thing for
[17:22] shareholders. But there will be
[17:24] companies that take it too far. They get
[17:25] overlevered. They they they become
[17:26] undisiplined. They don't know how some
[17:29] of the uh instruments that they're using
[17:31] uh actually work. And um that's where
[17:33] there will be some issues. So, I don't
[17:35] know who who it ends up being. I kind of
[17:37] think of it like uh if uh we're all
[17:40] walking across a field and there's some
[17:42] landmines planted at the end of the
[17:45] field is uh the next bull market, who's
[17:49] going to make it, right? Uh my guess is
[17:51] it's not going to be 100% of people. Um
[17:53] but also look, I think that the public
[17:54] markets also bring a lot of scrutiny.
[17:56] One of the things that people don't give
[17:57] credit to the public markets is the
[17:58] public markets are pretty good about
[18:00] sniffing out kind of things that don't
[18:02] work, right? If you remember we work
[18:04] when they got their S1 they put it
[18:05] public markets basically rejected it and
[18:07] said uh you ain't bringing this here at
[18:08] that valuation etc. Um if you go and you
[18:11] look at I saw uh my friend Austin Reef
[18:14] um you know he's retired right now so he
[18:16] he's got a lot of free time on his
[18:17] hands. I don't co-founder of morning
[18:19] brew. He he's on uh he's on Google
[18:21] Finance just Google and every company he
[18:22] could think of I guess cuz he was
[18:24] showing you know Rent the Runway is down
[18:26] like sub$25 million market cap all down
[18:29] you know whatever significantly $30 $40
[18:31] million market cap um and all these
[18:33] brands that really came from uh the last
[18:36] you know decade or so got to the public
[18:38] markets and just got hammered. Now, some
[18:40] of them are probably getting hammered um
[18:43] you know, in a way that uh isn't fair to
[18:45] them, but a lot of them just weren't
[18:47] that great at companies, right? And so,
[18:49] you can build a great product, not be a
[18:50] good company. You can, you know, have
[18:52] all kinds of issues around capitalizing
[18:53] your business or the the returns that
[18:55] you drive, whatever. So, I just think
[18:56] that public markets in general are very
[18:59] very very good at scrutinizing
[19:00] companies. And I do think that the
[19:03] efficient market hypothesis is nonsense.
[19:05] I think there's a lot of asymmetry that
[19:07] ends up being uh available in public
[19:09] markets at certain times, but over the
[19:11] long run, usually public markets will
[19:13] get it right. Um, and I think that
[19:15] that's why you continue to see certain
[19:17] companies do incredibly well in the
[19:18] public markets and other companies
[19:20] basically just get, you know, chewed up
[19:21] and spit out and uh, you know, let's see
[19:24] what happens with these uh, Bitcoin
[19:25] companies. But right now, the market's
[19:27] very excited and they think that uh,
[19:29] this is a strategy that is going to
[19:30] deliver at least short-term shareholder
[19:32] returns. Um and so far they haven't been
[19:34] wrong. Correct. Uh let's talk about
[19:37] public markets. And I think a big driver
[19:38] of the volatility that we have seen is
[19:40] obviously what's going on with the
[19:42] government today. Uh both with Doge and
[19:44] just kind of like what are they thinking
[19:46] about? Um are we just going to keep
[19:48] printing money or is is there no
[19:50] balanced budget and we're just going to
[19:51] continue to print and asset prices will
[19:53] continue to go up over a long period of
[19:55] time? Is that kind of what your
[19:56] consensus is? Well, let's take a step
[19:59] back here for a second. Right. So, um I
[20:01] think there's a lot of folks who uh were
[20:04] very excited about the current
[20:06] administration going into the White
[20:08] House. Now, if you remember, I called
[20:11] out throughout the entire campaign
[20:13] season over and over and over and over
[20:15] and over and over again that it was a
[20:18] shame that neither candidate was
[20:20] promising to balance the budget. And I
[20:22] said to myself, it used to be during my
[20:25] adult lifetime. You
[20:27] pretended I promise I'm going to, you
[20:29] know, balance the budget. Yeah, I'm
[20:31] going to give it a good, you know, good
[20:32] try, whatever. You get in the office,
[20:34] you don't do it. So, on one hand, I was
[20:35] like, well, at least they're not lying
[20:36] to us on this one, right? They know they
[20:38] can't balance the budget. On the other
[20:39] hand, like at least pretend, right? At
[20:42] least pretend you care. So, when Trump
[20:46] got into office and he started talking
[20:48] about balancing the budget, I actually
[20:50] got really excited about that. I said,
[20:51] "Fuck, man. He's going to take a run at
[20:53] this. Maybe he actually didn't talk
[20:54] about on the campaign trail because he
[20:56] knew that no one was going to believe
[20:58] him, but now that he's in and he's got
[21:00] this mandate and his landslide victory,
[21:01] what like he can go and he can really
[21:02] make a lot of change." And then he was
[21:05] like, I'm going to recruit an allstar
[21:06] team. I got Elon Musk, the slasher of
[21:10] waste in all these companies. He's going
[21:12] to come in and Elon's going to bring all
[21:15] the super genius kids and he's going to
[21:16] bring, you know, the co-founder of
[21:18] Airbnb and he's going to bring that. I
[21:20] was like, "Dude, let's go. Silicon
[21:24] Valley is going to Washington and
[21:25] they're bringing their scissors and
[21:27] we're just going to we're going to cut
[21:29] all these things." So, it was exciting.
[21:32] And the other thing that they did, which
[21:33] I thought was really important, is they
[21:34] essentially figured out how to make it a
[21:36] high status thing to go work in the
[21:38] government. I How long have you heard me
[21:40] say that none of my smartest friends
[21:41] want to go work in the government? That
[21:42] changed over the last, you know, 12
[21:44] months. A lot of my smartest friends
[21:46] went to go work in the government and
[21:48] also wanted to go work in the
[21:49] government. So, I think that was like a
[21:50] very new thing that that happened. Fast
[21:53] forward, now we're in May. They got into
[21:56] office in January. White flags out. I
[22:00] hate to see it. I don't like it. White
[22:02] flags are out. And my assessment of what
[22:05] has happened is that the Doge and cost
[22:08] cutting measures ran into two things.
[22:12] One is the brick wall of bureaucracy.
[22:15] It's just like it's a blob. It's a
[22:17] faceless big brick wall of bureaucracy.
[22:21] There is no thing to you can't get to
[22:24] it, right? And so the blob continues to
[22:27] win. It's like uh Bubble Boy. Remember
[22:30] that movie, right? It's like we put the
[22:32] government spending in this big bubble
[22:34] thing. Nothing can get in. You got a
[22:36] biological attack not getting in. you
[22:38] got uh cost cutting is not getting it
[22:40] just whatever you try you're going to
[22:42] run into a roadblock. Bubble boy is
[22:44] protected, right? The the budget is
[22:47] protected. The other thing they ran into
[22:50] is they ran into the system. Now the
[22:54] bureaucracy to be clear is not only the
[22:56] the politicians politicians. Do you
[22:59] remember the videos of them showing up
[23:00] outside of the government buildings
[23:02] demanding to like see Elon? Yeah. or
[23:05] being like, "What do you mean you're
[23:06] going to cut the whatever?" And these
[23:08] guys were just tweeting like absurd
[23:10] things every day. It was it got to the
[23:11] point they were tweeting things. You're
[23:12] like, "That can't be true. There's no
[23:14] way that nobody with half a brain
[23:17] previously allowed that to happen." And
[23:19] then it comes out and it's like, "That
[23:21] is true." Like these people are just
[23:22] blowing cash all over the place. And a
[23:25] lot of it
[23:26] was waste, abuse, fraud, I think was the
[23:29] terminology that the administration
[23:31] used. I would argue there's a lot of
[23:32] people on the internet who were like,
[23:34] you should put that in the translator on
[23:36] Google translate and actually it
[23:37] translate to corruption, whatever words
[23:40] you want to use. That was what was
[23:41] happening there. But they also got
[23:43] fought by the media at every single
[23:46] step. And so what we had was we had a
[23:50] part of the equation or part of the
[23:52] conversation that did not have the
[23:54] American people's best interest at
[23:56] heart. Instead, what they said was
[23:58] anything that our political opponent
[24:00] does, we are going to fight back
[24:02] against. And whether people like it or
[24:03] not, the media is very left-leaning,
[24:05] right? There are certainly pockets where
[24:06] people are uh kind of fair and balanced
[24:08] or they are um you know, kind of not on
[24:11] either side. One of the terms that I
[24:12] hear uh reporters use a lot is they call
[24:15] balls and strikes kind of like an
[24:16] umpire. Uh some of them do that, a lot
[24:19] of them don't, right? So, there's some
[24:20] good ones obviously. Uh there's plenty
[24:22] that are just like mouthpieces for
[24:24] left-leaning causes, parties, etc. Right
[24:27] leaning as well too, right? There's
[24:28] some, but definitely the media skews to
[24:31] the left. I think that that's kind of an
[24:32] objective fact when you look at
[24:34] donations, when you look at coverage,
[24:35] all this kind of stuff. So again, it's
[24:36] important to have both. I think you
[24:38] should you want left leaning, you want
[24:39] right leaning, you actually want
[24:40] independent, you want kind of a full
[24:42] slate. You want to give people choice,
[24:43] you want to inform people, whatever,
[24:44] right? But if you go look and just
[24:47] objectively look at the coverage, the
[24:49] Doge effort, the cost cutting effort got
[24:51] fought every single step of the way. And
[24:54] so instead, if we had a bunch of people
[24:57] sit down and say, "Hey, what's best for
[24:58] the American people? Cut government
[25:00] spending." Great. Let's do a group
[25:01] exercise. We're all together going to go
[25:03] cut this spending, right? Have the
[25:06] media, have the politicians, have Elon
[25:08] and Doge, everybody sit down. And that
[25:09] was the objective. I think that we could
[25:12] have made progress. The problem is that
[25:14] multiple people sitting at that table
[25:15] that that wasn't their objective. Their
[25:17] objective was drive clicks, fight
[25:19] against the people they didn't like,
[25:21] claim victory, right? All these other
[25:23] things come into play. And then of
[25:25] course there's the incentive of like a
[25:26] lot of these people are benefiting from
[25:27] this stuff, right? And so you say to
[25:29] yourself, okay, well, if people are
[25:30] handing out money, there's a lot of
[25:32] folks interested in that not getting
[25:34] shut off, right? And so I think that was
[25:36] one huge kind of I brick wall of
[25:38] bureaucracy, media and politicians all
[25:40] get put in there. The other hand is the
[25:42] system. And the system, it's kind of
[25:44] like uh if you got a car, right? It's
[25:46] low in it's running low on gas. You got
[25:48] to fill it up. If you don't fill it up,
[25:50] what happens? It stops running, right?
[25:52] Well, if you ever been in a car when it
[25:54] runs out of gas, what does it kind of
[25:55] do? It's like gasping for energy at the
[25:57] end, right? It's gasping for the last
[25:59] couple drops of uh gasoline that it can
[26:01] use, right? Well, that's basically what
[26:04] started to happen here was they started
[26:06] shutting things off and all of a sudden
[26:08] you could kind of feel the we're running
[26:10] out of gas, right? And so naturally,
[26:13] there's a lot of things um in terms of
[26:16] the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, the
[26:17] politicians, the president that said,
[26:19] "Whoa, hold on a second. I don't want to
[26:20] run out of gas here." And so because of
[26:23] those two things, we've waved a white
[26:24] flag and all you got to do is just
[26:26] listen to what they say. That's the
[26:28] beauty of I think right now in modern uh
[26:31] politics and uh modern kind of monetary
[26:33] and fiscal policy. Just listen to what
[26:36] they say. That was true of the Biden
[26:38] administration. That was true of the
[26:40] Trump
[26:41] administration. They went from talking
[26:43] about saving, cutting, waste, abuse,
[26:45] fraud, all the terminology to now Elon's
[26:48] out there tweeting. He's talking about
[26:50] uh I think we got to grow our way out of
[26:52] the problem. Besson, he's on uh TV. He's
[26:54] talking about we got to grow without
[26:56] increasing the debt. Right? Everyone now
[26:58] it's like a memo went out and everyone's
[27:00] like stop talking about cutting. Start
[27:02] talking about growing. Well, when I hear
[27:04] growth coming from Washington DC, what I
[27:09] know comes next is printing. To them,
[27:12] growth is printing. Printing is
[27:14] inflation. If inflation comes, what I
[27:16] I'll predict it right now. You're going
[27:17] to see headlines. Inflation's going to
[27:19] come back and it may not go to, you
[27:21] know, 8% 9% whatever. Um, but maybe it
[27:24] ticks up to two and a half, 3%, right?
[27:27] Three and a half percent, what, whatever
[27:28] the number is. A bunch of these uh
[27:31] smooth brains on the internet, I think
[27:33] is the right term. They're going to, ah,
[27:35] the tariffs, the tariffs. Look at the
[27:36] tariffs, right? I'm calling it right
[27:39] now. The there's a line in the sand. We
[27:41] changed strategies, right? As a country.
[27:44] I don't agree with changing the
[27:46] strategy. I don't like it, but that's
[27:47] what just happened. And so now I'm going
[27:50] from telling you that tariffs are
[27:51] deflationary, which in inflation fell
[27:53] off a cliff since December of last year
[27:55] because of all the tariff stuff.
[27:56] Everyone's worried about this economic
[27:58] slowdown, all this stuff. I'm telling
[27:59] you right now, we're going to regime
[28:00] change and now we're going the other
[28:01] direction. Inflation is going to come
[28:03] back and it's because they're going to
[28:04] print money. Milton Friedman, famous
[28:06] economist, great guy. What's he say?
[28:08] Inflation is only created in one place,
[28:10] Washington DC. If they print money, that
[28:13] leads to inflation. They going to print
[28:14] a lot of money. Spending bill. Well,
[28:17] hey, party's back on, baby. Right.
[28:19] That's something everyone in government
[28:20] can agree on. Hell yeah. Listen, if they
[28:24] put a bill in front of you that says,
[28:25] "We're going to give X dollars to your
[28:27] constituents," who's going to vote
[28:29] against that? Today's episode is brought

[29:42] retirement today. What's going on, guys?
[29:45] I hope you're enjoying this episode.
[29:47] Before you continue, I want you to know
[29:48] about a brand new show called From the
[29:50] Desk of Anthony Pompiano. I sit down at
[29:52] my desk every single morning and I
[29:54] explain what I think about current
[29:55] events. It's a great show that hopefully
[29:57] will keep you informed and entertained
[29:59] to a little bit. And so if you go all
[30:01] the way over to the other channel, From
[30:02] the Desk of Anthony Pompiano on YouTube,
[30:04] Rumble X, and every other platform, From
[30:06] the Desk of Anthony Papiano is a show
[30:08] that'll keep you informed about all
[30:10] things financial markets, general
[30:11] business, pop culture, and of course,
[30:13] Bitcoin. I'll see you guys over there.
[30:15] Now, let's get back into this episode.
[30:16] If they put a bill in front of you that
[30:18] says we're going to give X dollars to
[30:20] your constituents, who's going to vote
[30:22] against that? It takes somebody so
[30:24] principled, so courageous, so strong of
[30:28] a backbone to say, "No, I'm not voting
[30:30] for that." Right? There are some people
[30:32] who are going to do that, but they're
[30:35] voting no knowing it ain't going to
[30:37] matter cuz most people they going to
[30:38] take they going to take the incentive,
[30:40] right? And so they're going to vote for
[30:41] the bill. And so you got government
[30:42] spending coming, you got the money
[30:44] printer, you hear things like running
[30:46] the economy hot. That's code for money
[30:49] printing. And so what you're going to
[30:50] see here is you're going to see that.
[30:51] And so ultimately it concludes with one
[30:53] simple thing. We're going to go back to
[30:55] this only intelligence test that matters
[30:58] for people in their financial life. Are
[31:00] you a saver or are you an investor? If
[31:02] you're an investor, you're going to be a
[31:03] winner. If you're a saver, you're going
[31:04] to be a loser. Look, I just shoot
[31:06] straight as as blunt as I can put it. If
[31:09] you are sitting there, which something
[31:10] like 50% of Americans are sitting there
[31:12] with no investment assets and you have
[31:13] 100% of your wealth in dollars, you go
[31:15] and get crushed. I don't want you to get
[31:17] crushed. You don't want to get crushed.
[31:19] I wish the system wasn't built this way.
[31:21] I wish they would incentives weren't in
[31:22] place. I wish they weren't going to
[31:23] print money. Everything we could talk
[31:24] about, it ain't going to change the fact
[31:26] that you're going to get crushed if
[31:27] you're sitting with 100% of your wealth
[31:28] sitting in dollars. And that's at least
[31:31] a very big percentage, if not 50% of the
[31:33] country. The other
[31:35] 50%. Come on. You see the article in the
[31:38] Wall Street Journals, I think it was, or
[31:39] New York Times talking about how much it
[31:41] cost to go to the Hamptons. No, you're
[31:43] going to see a lot. You're going to see
[31:44] a lot more. By the way, it's not what
[31:46] you thought it was. Hampton's is
[31:47] overrated. They they followed like a
[31:49] group of women that went to the
[31:50] Hamptons. I think they said like the
[31:51] bill was like $3,500. I said, "I don't
[31:53] know where y'all going in the I saw that
[31:54] actually staying at Motel 6." That
[31:56] seemed low. That's what I'm saying. They
[31:58] must have meal the whole weekend. Yeah.
[32:00] Eat one meal, you know, go to the beach
[32:02] in the in the public free zone, right?
[32:04] The Motel 6. He had $3,500 bucks, right?
[32:07] I don't know anybody that is going out
[32:09] there in the way that they were
[32:10] describing their life that spent
[32:12] $3,500. Um, but there going to be a lot
[32:15] more of that. You're gonna see 2021.
[32:18] That was warm-up. That was like uh uh
[32:21] going to the batting cage and being
[32:22] like, "One day I hope I can go to the
[32:24] big show, right? You hitting the 95 mph
[32:26] fast ball." Nah, we going to the big
[32:29] times now. They print this money because
[32:31] now psychologically people, they've seen
[32:33] it before. They know, right? It's why
[32:35] all recessions have been outlawed in the
[32:37] economy is because as soon as the
[32:39] central bank sees recession coming,
[32:42] what' I tell you? Everyone was just
[32:44] talking about recession three, four
[32:45] weeks ago. What are they going to do
[32:47] now? Cut interest rates, print money.
[32:48] It's the playbook. Recessions are
[32:51] outlawed and they going to bring the
[32:52] heat now. And so when they do that,
[32:54] spending, all this stuff, it's going to
[32:56] push asset prices. It's going to put
[32:57] liquidity in the market. You're going to
[32:58] see the velocity of money really take up
[33:00] uh business owners, asset owners, th
[33:03] those people are going to do really
[33:04] well. Well, what do they what do they do
[33:05] when they do really
[33:07] well? Get on the planes, get on the
[33:09] trains, get on the yachts, right? go to
[33:12] the different things, spend money,
[33:13] consume, do it's a party. And so I think
[33:16] that's where we're headed back to. And
[33:18] so if you think about investment assets,
[33:19] anything that's liquid and denominated
[33:22] in dollars probably going to do pretty
[33:23] well. Public stocks going up, Bitcoin
[33:24] going up, gold going up, certain real
[33:26] estate, REITs, things like that going
[33:27] up. If it's liquid, it's denominated in
[33:30] dollars, five years from now is going
[33:31] up, right? And so the question then
[33:33] becomes, well, what about the private
[33:35] market? And my guess is that's also
[33:37] going up because you're going to have
[33:37] more liquidity chasing all this stuff.
[33:39] Um, and so 2020, 2021, go study that. If
[33:44] they print money, remember in April when
[33:47] prices were down 20%. Remember that?
[33:49] Everyone was mooping around, everyone
[33:50] was all sad on the internet saying
[33:52] recession. People talk about the Great
[33:54] Depression, all this nonsense. I You
[33:57] ever seen the meme where that guy stands
[33:58] up in church by himself and he's like
[34:00] the lone voice and I kept saying alltime
[34:02] highs before the end of the
[34:04] year? Get get a cigar ready. We we going
[34:07] when that when that things hits new
[34:08] alltime highs, right? I'm I'mma hit you
[34:11] with the uh the security guard shrug uh
[34:14] from the Michael Jordan documentary,
[34:16] right? Like I told you, like what what
[34:18] do you guys want? Right? The faster it
[34:20] falls, the faster it recovers, they're
[34:21] going to print money. They're never
[34:22] going to let us get in a recession. And
[34:24] here we go. I mean, the correlation
[34:26] between M2 money supply and you know,
[34:28] Bitcoin and pretty much every asset
[34:30] across the board for investors is a
[34:32] positive correlation. We could say that
[34:34] if there's more money chasing the same
[34:36] number of goods, well, guess what
[34:38] happens? If there's more money chasing
[34:40] the same number of investment assets,
[34:42] guess what happens? And so that's what h
[34:44] that that is ultimately what we're
[34:45] watching play out here. This is the the
[34:47] only thing that matters in investing.
[34:50] You could be, you know, some genius
[34:52] portfolio manager. You could run be at a
[34:54] hedge fund spending billions of dollars
[34:56] of, you know, capex and opex or whatever
[34:58] you want to do. Try to get your computer
[35:00] a little bit closer to the data center,
[35:02] right? run the fiber optic cable, get
[35:04] your Bloomberg, have three Bloomberg,
[35:06] seven screen, what, whatever you
[35:08] want. If you don't understand this one
[35:10] thing, people who are literally trading
[35:13] on their phone are going to beat you
[35:15] because guess what? Inflation is going
[35:18] to be a structural tailwind for asset
[35:20] prices. And therefore, if you just buy
[35:22] assets and chill, game on. Um, let's end
[35:26] on this. So obviously if there is a
[35:28] influx of new capital into the market uh
[35:30] one of the big drivers I think of the
[35:32] bitcoin price and correct me if I'm
[35:33] wrong is uh bitcoin treasury companies.
[35:36] What is the appetite for bitcoin
[35:38] treasury companies and how much can it
[35:39] get diluted over you know then if the
[35:42] next year we see a thousand bitcoin
[35:44] treasury companies come on and they all
[35:46] bought you know 10 billion of bitcoin
[35:48] obviously there would be some price
[35:49] movement there. Um but is there an
[35:51] appetite from investors that want that
[35:52] versus just going off and saying hey
[35:54] look let me go buy this asset myself. um
[35:56] because there are some you know custody
[35:58] concerns and some other things going on
[35:59] there.
[36:01] I don't want to get into all the details
[36:03] right now but
[36:04] um many of the investors who are
[36:07] investing in these things uh they're not
[36:10] just buying it for Bitcoin exposure.
[36:12] They can go buy Bitcoin, right? Um these
[36:14] people are very intelligent. They are
[36:16] very sophisticated. Uh they have a lot
[36:18] of money and what they're not trying to
[36:21] do is they don't need to make 50x their
[36:23] money. if they can pick up a couple of
[36:26] percentage points here and there on a
[36:27] lot of money, that's good. That's good
[36:29] enough for them, right? And so, um, I
[36:32] will give you, um, maybe one example
[36:35] that would be
[36:36] helpful. There's a lot of people who are
[36:38] investing in these things as a way to
[36:40] arb the premiums.
[36:43] People smart, they can figure out how to
[36:44] do it. Um, but if something has a dollar
[36:49] worth of Bitcoin, but it's trading at
[36:52] $2, well, there's a dollar premium. You
[36:55] think people aren't trying to lock in
[36:56] that dollar premium? Say, I want no
[36:58] risk. I want to be neutral exposure to
[37:00] the asset and I just want to clip that
[37:02] $1
[37:03] premium. Now, you can see why so much
[37:06] capital is pouring in, right? That's
[37:07] just one of many ways that people are
[37:09] playing this. And so, um, yes, are
[37:11] people buying Bitcoin? Of course, right?
[37:14] They want exposure, all this stuff. But
[37:16] the really big pools of capital, the
[37:18] reason why this trade is so hot right
[37:19] now has much more to do with people
[37:21] figuring out different ways to um kind
[37:24] of risk mitigated drive returns than
[37:27] just like, oh, I can't figure out how to
[37:28] buy Bitcoin, so let me go buy it over
[37:30] here, right? Yeah. I feel bad for the
[37:33] day traders right now. Why? Just so much
[37:35] volatility, so much uncertainty. They
[37:36] need volatility. Yeah. If you're a day
[37:38] trader, if you're like a legit, not
[37:40] like, "Hey, I I I look at the market,"
[37:42] but if you're like a legit day trader,
[37:43] you need the volatility, right? Um if it
[37:46] just goes sideways every day, then you
[37:48] don't make any money, right? Um so, so
[37:50] don't feel bad for them. They they
[37:51] they're thankful for it. Um I think the
[37:53] people who uh hopefully are, you know,
[37:57] you send this stuff to your friends,
[37:58] right? Send this video. Explain to
[38:00] people, listen, you got to understand
[38:01] what you're buying. That's true of every
[38:03] asset class. go and figure out if you're
[38:05] gonna buy a stock, what explain it to
[38:07] me. Can you explain the stock to me
[38:09] better than I can explain it to you?
[38:10] That's probably a pretty good spot to
[38:12] start with. Why are you buying this
[38:13] thing? Right? Um I always love the uh
[38:15] the idea of like if you're going to buy
[38:17] something and not hold it for, you know,
[38:19] 2 3 5 10 whatever your your time frame
[38:22] is, then why buy it for 5 minutes,
[38:24] right? You know, all these different
[38:26] things. It just goes back to like
[38:27] timeless investing principles do not
[38:29] change.
[38:30] You can take those timeless investing
[38:32] principles if you are smart, take the
[38:34] time to learn them, you know, implement
[38:35] them, etc. to new industries. But the
[38:37] timeless investing principles, they're
[38:38] timeless for a reason. And so I think
[38:40] that that's a huge piece of this is if
[38:42] you think that you're the next Warren
[38:43] Buffett or George Soros or Steve Cohen
[38:45] or whatever, well, one odds just given
[38:48] the probability you're not, right? But
[38:50] somebody is, right? Okay. Well, take the
[38:55] things to learn from these people and
[38:57] apply it in new areas, right? that
[38:59] there's a reason why they've been
[39:01] successful. Don't just I always laugh
[39:03] when I hear people be like, uh, oh,
[39:05] they're dumb. Like, well, uh,
[39:07] objectively they're not dumb, right?
[39:09] Actually, they're objectively smart. Um,
[39:11] you may not like what they do. You may
[39:13] think that you can do something better
[39:14] or different or whatever, but learn from
[39:17] them and then make it your own. I think
[39:18] that's a huge piece of this is, uh,
[39:20] people want to operate in a black and
[39:22] white world, but like the gray area is
[39:24] can you explain to someone why was
[39:26] Warren Buffett successful? Why was Steve
[39:29] Cohen successful? Why was Paul Tudtor
[39:31] Jones or Stanley Ducken Miller that like
[39:33] just go through all of these folks? Take
[39:36] the lessons from every single one of
[39:37] them and then say from these lessons
[39:40] combined with what I am uniquely good at
[39:42] or interested in, how do I apply it to a
[39:44] new area and then that is kind of that
[39:47] that's your domain. Go play in that
[39:49] domain. Um, and I just think that uh not
[39:51] enough people are are doing that yet.
[39:52] And so I hope that people who come into
[39:54] Bitcoin understand Bitcoin. Go read the
[39:56] white paper.
[39:57] There's a gazillion hours of podcasts or
[40:01] articles to read or tweets or whatever.
[40:03] Like, go learn. As you learn, implement
[40:07] best timeless investing principles and
[40:09] you'll be fine. Just let the market do
[40:11] its thing. There's 1500 episodes of the
[40:13] Palm podcast that could go listen to. I
[40:15] don't know if you want to do that. That
[40:16] would take a long time and uh you
[40:18] probably get tired of hearing my voice,
[40:19] but uh 2x speed. That's true. That's
[40:21] true. Well, you talk a little fast for
[40:23] 2x speed. I probably I by the way people
[40:26] always uh say when they meet me in
[40:27] person they're like oh you talk faster
[40:28] in person but I try really hard to slow
[40:30] down whenever a microphone's in front of
[40:32] me but you know it's not really that
[40:33] easy cuz I could talk like this and then
[40:35] people are like wait what the hell he's
[40:36] talking so fast like well I got a lot to
[40:37] say and you know let's just be more
[40:39] efficient here. There's nothing worse
[40:41] than sitting down in a meeting and the
[40:44] person starts talking dragging it off
[40:48] like this. You're like oh man I love you
[40:52] but I ain't got time for this. We got to
[40:53] hurry up. Like, just tell me to spit it
[40:54] out. Let's go. What's the thing you got
[40:56] to do? Um, and so, uh, you know, it is
[40:58] what it is. All right. All right.
[40:59] Appreciate you. All right. Thanks
[41:01] everyone for watching. Talk to you guys
[41:02] next
