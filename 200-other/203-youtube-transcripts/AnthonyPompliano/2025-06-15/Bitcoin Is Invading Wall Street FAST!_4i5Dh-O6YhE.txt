[00:00] Bitcoin is the hurdle rate for
[00:02] innovation. That's kind of what bit
[00:04] bonds are. At the end of the day, you're
[00:06] incorporating the hurdle rate, which in
[00:08] this case, the Bitcoin returns. It
[00:10] doesn't mean in the future we won't have
[00:12] the returns, but when you're using any
[00:13] kind of structure, you're looking for
[00:15] demand and people going, I want to get
[00:16] involved, but you know what? I kind of
[00:18] want to get involved in in Bitcoin, but
[00:20] I want to have my principal protected.
[00:22] So, give me the chance of making 15%,
[00:24] but protect my principal. So, I think
[00:25] this is step one of eventually the
[00:28] United States government figuring a way
[00:30] to do this and tapping the demand that's
[00:31] out there. What's going on, guys? We've
[00:34] got our weekly episode with Jordy
[00:36] Visser. Jord's got 30 years of Wall
[00:38] Street experience and he's bringing it
[00:39] to you fast and furious. Exactly what
[00:41] you need to know about what's happened
[00:42] this week and how it's going to affect
[00:44] your portfolio. We get into what's going
[00:45] on at Bitcoin, Bitcoin bonds, why are
[00:48] countries buying Bitcoin, what is also
[00:50] going on with artificial intelligence,
[00:52] the new VO3 model that just came out,
[00:54] and then how we should be thinking about
[00:56] the tariffs and the ability for the
[00:58] courts to maybe remove them or maybe
[01:00] not. We've got it all covered for you,
[01:02] everything that happened this week and
[01:03] what it's going to do to your portfolio
[01:04] here today. Here's my latest
[01:06] conversation with Jordi Visser. All
[01:07] right, Jordy, I thought a great place to
[01:08] start this conversation is the idea of a
[01:10] bit bond. uh this bond concept with
[01:13] Bitcoin backing it. We now have the
[01:15] mayor of New York City saying he is
[01:17] going to use this. So this is no longer
[01:18] theory. It's no longer uh kind of
[01:20] academic, you know, uh uh kind of u
[01:22] pontificating. We now are saying there's
[01:25] a city who's going to use a bit bond.
[01:26] What is a bit bond? And do you think
[01:27] these are a good idea? Well, first of
[01:29] all, I think they're a great idea. Um
[01:32] and that's not just from someone who
[01:34] believes in Bitcoin. Um we have the
[01:37] merging of of two systems. And so, you
[01:41] know, we've talked extensively not only
[01:43] about what's going on,
[01:45] but I kind of look at the world right
[01:47] now as the old fiat economy that's very
[01:50] industrialized, the digital economy,
[01:53] which has been growing rapidly, doesn't
[01:55] need debt, and then the payment side and
[01:58] using this new capital structure of the
[02:00] new system. So, I've always viewed since
[02:02] the day that uh I kind of embraced
[02:05] Bitcoin as not a currency in any way,
[02:07] shape, or form for me, but really as
[02:09] kind of the idea of a new capital
[02:11] structure. And because you have these
[02:15] separate economies, you have an enormous
[02:17] amount of capital that people want
[02:21] attached to Bitcoin. Michael Sailor's
[02:23] obviously done this extensively. So, why
[02:25] shouldn't governments be doing it? As
[02:27] someone who grew up in the financial
[02:29] markets, you're trying to
[02:31] issue structures, whether they're bonds,
[02:34] whether they're equities, whether
[02:35] doesn't really matter towards where the
[02:37] demand is. So, we've talked about how
[02:38] it's been hard, very difficult for
[02:41] people to sell private equity. There's
[02:43] been IPOs are just not coming through.
[02:45] M&A is still slow, but yet anyone that
[02:48] raises money for anything related to
[02:50] crypto overs
[02:52] subscribed. And that's where the demand
[02:54] is. And so the great thing about capital
[02:56] markets is you start migrating towards
[02:58] where the demand is. Now the great thing
[02:59] about the bond is on the one
[03:01] side, New York and the whole country has
[03:04] a problem. They need to fund at lower
[03:06] interest rates to be able to deal with
[03:08] the budget problems. And if people are
[03:10] willing to take a lower
[03:12] coupon and get participation in Bitcoin
[03:15] as a way to get higher returns and at
[03:18] the same point are guaranteed their
[03:20] principle, there's going to be demand
[03:22] for that at this point because Bitcoin
[03:23] has such a great track record. And
[03:25] that's the part um I I I don't Did you
[03:28] go to the Bitcoin conference? You did
[03:29] not. You did not. Okay. So, one of my
[03:31] favorite lines I saw uh Matt Seagull,
[03:33] who I've I've known um for a long time
[03:36] because he's another Trady person that
[03:37] that went into this route. He wrote
[03:40] about Bitcoin is the hurdle rate for
[03:44] innovation. That's kind of what bit
[03:46] bonds are. At the end of the day, you're
[03:48] incorporating the hurdle rate, which in
[03:50] this case, the Bitcoin returns. It
[03:52] doesn't mean in the future we won't have
[03:54] the returns, but when you're using any
[03:56] kind of structure, you're looking for
[03:57] demand and people going, I want to get
[03:58] involved, but you know what? I kind of
[04:00] want to get involved in in Bitcoin, but
[04:02] I want to have my principal protected.
[04:04] So, give me the chance of making 15%,
[04:06] but protect my principal. So, I think
[04:08] this is step one of eventually the
[04:11] United States government figuring a way
[04:12] to do this and tapping the demand that's
[04:14] out there. So, how will this work? Let's
[04:16] say that I have $100,000. I want to uh
[04:19] put it into a bit bond. Uh I will be
[04:22] told uh we will guarantee the return of
[04:24] your $100,000. Um, I will be told that
[04:27] maybe I'll get like a 2 3% yield and
[04:30] then I can get up to 15% return from the
[04:33] performance of Bitcoin over let's say 5
[04:35] years or something. When I put the
[04:38] $100,000 in to buy this bond, I
[04:40] obviously get the bond. What do they do
[04:41] with my $100,000? How do they generate
[04:43] the yield, do you think? And then how do
[04:44] they just put it all in Bitcoin, half in
[04:46] Bitcoin? You know, kind of walk me
[04:47] through what at least we think they'll
[04:49] do as of right now. Now again, it
[04:51] depends on the final structuring of how
[04:53] they go through this, but there'll be
[04:54] some sort of participation and and
[04:57] basically there's infinite ways of kind
[04:59] of going through the Bitcoin piece.
[05:00] Let's just do the simple piece. You've
[05:02] got a bond that if they issued it
[05:04] normally, let's say had a coupon, a
[05:06] yield of let's just use 5%. And it's 10
[05:10] years. So 5% over 10 years, that's the
[05:12] interest you'd have to pay the person
[05:14] buying it. But instead, you go, you're
[05:16] only going to get 1%. That extra 4% a
[05:19] year goes towards to make it as simple
[05:21] as possible buying a call option on
[05:23] Bitcoin. So you take that money, you go
[05:26] buy a premium of call option on Bitcoin
[05:28] and let's assume it's an at the money
[05:29] call option as many as you can buy with
[05:32] that excess capital. So what looks like
[05:34] under the hood, the buyer of the bonds
[05:37] has purchased a zero coupon bond that
[05:40] matures in 10 years or something with a
[05:42] 1% that they're getting uh the the
[05:45] amount that is necessary. They're going
[05:46] to they're guaranteed their principal
[05:47] plus 1% a year. The excess dollars that
[05:49] would have gone towards the yield is
[05:51] going towards a bitcoin call option. So
[05:53] that means that at the end they have
[05:55] let's say 90% is the bond portion in
[05:58] cash principal protected because it's
[06:00] already on a US treasury and then on the
[06:02] other side they've got a call option on
[06:04] Bitcoin and that's the way that you can
[06:05] structure them. So you could do it as a
[06:06] call spread, you could do it as an out
[06:08] of the money. There's a variety of ways
[06:10] to do it, but I think these structures
[06:11] are going to become more and more
[06:13] popular after they get done once, twice,
[06:16] three times. Very similar to the Bitcoin
[06:18] reserves around the globe. You're
[06:20] getting more and more countries, more
[06:21] and more states doing it. As you get
[06:23] more and more people doing it, it's just
[06:25] the nature of the how the capital
[06:26] structure is changing. Companies will do
[06:29] this, countries, cities. Do we think
[06:32] like the banks will do this or is this
[06:34] just something where uh we can just go
[06:37] anywhere where debt is being issued? Um
[06:39] you should expect Bitcoin and debt to be
[06:42] tied together in some sort of bond
[06:43] structure. I I mean one thing you can
[06:45] always guarantee with the banks having
[06:47] worked at one if there's money to be
[06:48] made they will be selling these out of
[06:50] there. So I don't think it's a question
[06:52] that the banks will get involved in
[06:53] this. Remember Michael Sailor is doing
[06:55] it to help strategy grow. So he's doing
[06:58] it from a treasury a corporate treasury
[06:59] perspective. Um but he has proven that
[07:02] insurance companies will buy these types
[07:04] of things. The conver it it dominates
[07:06] the conver his his converts dominate the
[07:09] convertible bond market. You're seeing a
[07:11] merging of these two systems and that's
[07:13] the thing that I think people just have
[07:14] to embrace is you have the fiat system
[07:16] and then you have this bitcoin system as
[07:19] they'll call it the crypto world and
[07:21] they're just migrating together and
[07:22] stable coins is just another aspect of
[07:24] this in terms of helping. Now, uh,
[07:27] strategy has, um, the equity, they have
[07:30] the convertible notes and and bonds that
[07:32] people can, uh, participate in, but they
[07:35] also have, uh, a number of other, uh,
[07:37] instruments. Um, I think one is Strike,
[07:40] one is Strife, they've got, uh, MSTY,
[07:43] which is not theirs, but but, you know,
[07:45] is involved. Um, how do you look at
[07:48] their fundraising? Are they pioneering
[07:50] different ways to raise capital there?
[07:52] uh or are they just taking old
[07:53] instruments that maybe like the Bitcoin
[07:55] world isn't used to and saying, "Hey,
[07:57] here's, you know, a old school playbook
[08:00] for a new school world." I haven't seen
[08:02] one thing they've done that Wall Street
[08:05] hasn't done in some other form. And and
[08:07] I'll just give you an idea. I mean,
[08:09] they've got effectively what are like
[08:11] buy rights. So, um here you can buy
[08:14] Micro Strategy and we'll be selling
[08:16] calls against that position. Now, the
[08:19] structure and the way they're doing it
[08:20] is a little bit more modern day. But if
[08:22] I go back to when I first got uh was
[08:24] working at Morgan Stanley, there were
[08:27] things called perks and those were to
[08:30] help people during the beginning of the
[08:33] internet boom. So in ' 9394, you had a
[08:36] lot of people that wanted to own things
[08:38] like Cisco. And I use Cisco because
[08:41] Cisco's V was very similar to where
[08:43] Bitcoin's V was say five years ago.
[08:45] meaning Cisco was trading and in a 60 70
[08:49] 80 ball because the stock was going up
[08:51] 100% a year. And so if you're an income
[08:54] fund and you're like I I want to be part
[08:57] of this but they don't pay any
[08:58] dividends. So what they did is they
[09:00] created a structure where you you buy
[09:02] Cisco but then there's a a strike price.
[09:05] They sell a call option and that becomes
[09:07] the income portion of this product.
[09:09] Creating a structured product for the
[09:11] buyers is where the creativity comes in.
[09:15] The problem has been until you actually
[09:17] get to the point where you've proven
[09:19] there's demand for this, which is what
[09:20] Michael Sailor really did. He opened the
[09:22] doors for people to realize the demand
[09:24] side. And that's the part that New York
[09:27] City would not be happening without
[09:30] Michael Sailor starting this whole thing
[09:32] and showing that you can do this. Now,
[09:34] his goal was different than New York
[09:36] City's, but he's tapping into demand.
[09:39] So, you've seen the demand. everyone
[09:41] who's out there who's involved on the
[09:43] crypto side is starting to see that
[09:45] there is an insatiable demand and I
[09:47] think this will spread around the globe
[09:49] and it already is but I think this is
[09:50] just the beginning and we've also seen
[09:53] um a ton of announcements around
[09:55] tokenization so kind of the flip side
[09:57] right uh bitcoin is a new thing that is
[09:59] uh kind of going to the traditional
[10:01] world but now the people in the bitcoin
[10:03] and crypto world seem to be saying well
[10:04] let's take the old you know kind of
[10:06] incumbent assets and let's bring them
[10:07] into our world and so we saw Robin Hood
[10:09] recently come out and say that they're
[10:10] trying to get some tokenization stuff
[10:12] done. We've seen Superstate uh actually
[10:14] partner with uh a public company to do
[10:16] that. What is your take on this and is
[10:18] it just a foregone conclusion?
[10:21] Tokenization is a foregone conclusion
[10:23] and I remember the first time I saw a
[10:25] presentation
[10:27] uh on this. I don't know if you've ever
[10:29] had Sandy call on the um on your show. I
[10:33] think she's at Franklin Templeton right
[10:34] now. She was at city at the time and I
[10:36] attended an event and I would say this
[10:38] is when I first started to get
[10:39] interested in in in the blockchain
[10:42] rather than Bitcoin. So this is between
[10:44] 18 and 20 and I went to an event and she
[10:47] took through her vision of tokenization.
[10:49] So, I'm going to say this is
[10:50] 2019 and it was pretty compelling about
[10:54] giving access to investments to all
[10:57] individuals and being able to from a
[10:59] seller's perspective being able to sell
[11:02] your house and not have to wait for one
[11:05] buyer because you have a a very
[11:07] expensive house and you want to sell it,
[11:09] but actually having people go, you know
[11:10] what, I want to diversify my real estate
[11:12] investments. I'd love to have a little
[11:13] piece of Bergen County, New Jersey,
[11:16] which is one of the places that just
[11:17] said that they're going to start going
[11:19] to tokenization on deeds, which again
[11:22] has implications from a cost perspective
[11:24] for the governments of having all these
[11:25] things in in on the blockchain. But then
[11:28] from a seller, it's the ability of
[11:29] increasing demand dramatically because
[11:31] you may not be able to find enough
[11:32] sellers for this stuff. I think this is
[11:34] very important now with what we're
[11:36] seeing with the private equity world.
[11:38] Um, they want to sell some stuff. Okay.
[11:40] Well, selling blocks of stuff limits how
[11:42] many buyers there can be. And if
[11:44] everyone knows you're a seller and
[11:46] behind it there's a lot of sellers. You
[11:48] want to get as much demand as you can.
[11:50] And as retail has proven in the stock
[11:52] market, and this is one of the important
[11:53] things that I've that we've talked
[11:55] about, but I don't think enough people
[11:56] realize, the world's changing and retail
[11:59] has a lot more power than people
[12:00] realize. They're investing a lot.
[12:02] They're driving markets on the
[12:04] short-term basis much more so and they
[12:06] don't have the emotional connections to
[12:08] the fiat system. The historical baggage
[12:10] I think that comes along with recessions
[12:12] and this is going to end badly. And more
[12:14] importantly, uh it's a phrase that I
[12:16] Michael Sailor said that changed my life
[12:18] in terms of thinking about it. It's this
[12:20] thing of if you're wealthy, you don't
[12:23] need Bitcoin. And if you're not wealthy,
[12:25] you're looking for something to change
[12:27] your life and to be in. And that's why
[12:29] he got involved in it for his business.
[12:31] It's a powerful story. And so I think
[12:33] tokenization again fits Donald Trump.
[12:35] What he's trying to do in the country to
[12:36] spread the ability for people below a
[12:39] certain income to be able to invest in
[12:41] the same way that institutions do and
[12:43] the wealthy do. So I view tokenization
[12:45] as another decentralization factor
[12:47] that's very important to the overall
[12:48] distribution of of of securities in this
[12:51] country. Speaking of politics and
[12:53] economic policy, uh huge development
[12:55] this week is uh the International Trade
[12:58] Court uh came out and they said
[13:00] basically tariffs are illegal. You you
[13:02] can't do this in the way that you did
[13:03] it. You mean the tariff story isn't
[13:05] over? Yeah, it's not over. Um and
[13:07] obviously uh people went and they looked
[13:09] and they said, "Okay, it's not 100% of
[13:10] tariffs that fall under this court
[13:12] ruling, but it was a very large portion
[13:14] of them. Uh specifically the reciprocal
[13:15] tariffs. Uh but then there was an
[13:17] appeals court that at the end of the
[13:19] week came out and said, "No, no, you're
[13:20] good. tariffs are back on. So now we
[13:22] went from uh the president and the
[13:24] administration being the tariff on
[13:25] tariff off crowd to now the courts are
[13:27] tariff on tariff off and it feels like
[13:29] we're going to the Supreme Court. Like
[13:31] the only way this is going to get
[13:32] settled is go to the highest court in
[13:33] the land. They're going to decide can
[13:34] the president do this or can they not?
[13:36] What's your take not only on like where
[13:38] that'll end up but what is the impact on
[13:40] the market that we're still getting on
[13:42] off on off on a day-to-day basis?
[13:45] Today's episode is brought to you by
[13:46] Maple, the go-to place for onchain asset
[13:48] management. There aren't many teams in
[13:50] crypto who manage real money the right
[13:52] way, but Maple does. Maple now manages
[13:54] over a billion dollars, combining
[13:56] serious finance experience with DeFi
[13:58] innovation. I use Maple because they
[14:00] make it simple to earn real yield.
[14:01] Whether that's allocating stable coins
[14:03] for overcolized lending to institutions,
[14:05] depositing Bitcoin to their
[14:07] institutional Bitcoin yield offering, or
[14:09] accessing their premium DeFi assets like
[14:11] Syrup USDC. If you're serious about
[14:13] putting capital to work, then go to
[14:15] maple.inance to learn more. Once again,
[14:18] that's Maple. Go check them out today.
[14:20] Today's episode is brought to you by
[14:22] Core. You can earn yield on your Bitcoin
[14:24] by just holding your Bitcoin. It's
[14:26] simple. Core, the leading Bitcoin
[14:28] scaling solution, will reward you for
[14:30] not selling your Bitcoin. It's not
[14:32] magic. Here's how it works. Core is a
[14:34] protocol secured by elected validators.
[14:36] You can help elect validators and secure
[14:38] the network by simply locking up your
[14:39] Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain. No
[14:42] bridging, no lending, and just holding.
[14:44] When your validator secures core, it
[14:46] earns rewards fueled by network activity
[14:48] and passes them back to you as yield
[14:50] with a minimum lock up of just one day.
[14:52] When the time lock ends, you get your
[14:54] Bitcoin back untouched. Steal your keys,
[14:56] steal your coins, now your yield. For
[14:59] even higher rates, stake core alongside
[15:01] your Bitcoin and multiply your yield.
[15:03] And if you want to see what your Bitcoin
[15:04] is securing, join millions of others in
[15:06] exploring the largest Bitcoin DeFi
[15:08] ecosystem. There are over a 100 live
[15:10] apps in the network and the deepest
[15:12] liquidity in all of Bitcoin DeFi. Get
[15:15] off zero and start earning yield on even
[15:17] just 1% of your Bitcoin by going to
[15:21] stake.cordow.org/p. Again, that's
[15:25] stake.cordow.org/pump or go click the
[15:27] link in the description. Like the only
[15:28] way this is going to get settled is go
[15:30] to the highest court in the land.
[15:31] They're going to decide can the
[15:32] president do this or can they not.
[15:33] What's your take not only on like where
[15:36] that'll end up but what is the impact on
[15:37] the market that we're still getting on
[15:39] off on off on a day-to-day
[15:41] basis? So the court of the market
[15:44] already decided on this issue when bond
[15:46] rates went up uh meaning stocks, bonds
[15:49] and the currency fall at the same time
[15:51] and as we've said we haven't seen Peter
[15:53] Navaro much since then. We've seen a lot
[15:55] more of Scott Besson. So this has
[15:57] already happened. Um I think rather than
[16:00] go through whether this prevents
[16:02] anything, um Donald Trump posted
[16:06] immediately after that, you know, he's
[16:07] on a mission from God. though I I think
[16:09] people should just ignore all of the
[16:11] tariff back and forth and just focus on
[16:12] two two two parts. These are the
[16:15] structural realities. On the one side,
[16:18] you have a country that has a
[16:20] distribution of wealth problem that
[16:22] elected someone because the middle
[16:24] person in this country, the median
[16:26] person is having a hard time surviving
[16:29] through the inflation that was created
[16:30] postcoid and they're angry about it. And
[16:33] even though they have a job and even
[16:34] though they can go through it, they're
[16:35] realizing for a lot of reasons that
[16:37] they're stuck. And so he's trying to
[16:39] rebalance this a little bit, I I don't
[16:42] think that's changing. Um AI is going to
[16:45] worsen the situation. It's not going to
[16:47] make it better in the short run. In the
[16:49] long run, it will make it better, but
[16:51] people aren't feeling better about maybe
[16:55] living longer, having access to Chat
[16:57] GPT. Right now, what they care about is
[16:59] their financial situation. So on the one
[17:02] side, I think the thing that's caused
[17:03] the problem, which is the innovation,
[17:05] which has concentrated wealth with very
[17:06] few people, has led to Donald Trump
[17:08] getting elected. And as he said, and
[17:10] Scott Besson, who's been very, let's
[17:12] just say, uh, coolheaded throughout this
[17:15] whole thing, you have to go back to what
[17:16] he said in November of last year, he
[17:21] wants to be a part of the restructuring
[17:24] that needs to happen of the economic
[17:26] order, the global economic order. The
[17:29] tariff situation is just one part of
[17:31] this. We have a deficit. We have debt.
[17:34] They're going to keep going down this
[17:35] path of finding a way to get more
[17:37] revenues in the country. Tariffs were
[17:40] one way. A weaker currency is already
[17:43] happening. That's another way. And I
[17:45] posted this the second that that court
[17:47] ruling came out. My immediate reaction
[17:49] was if it's not tariffs, it's going to
[17:52] be capital controls. There's going to be
[17:54] a way that the problem that happens in
[17:57] the world where we have trade
[17:58] imbalances, that means we have a capital
[18:00] surplus. And if we have a capital
[18:01] surplus, it means foreigners, so let's
[18:03] just use Europe because he's brought
[18:05] this up. If Europe is being aggressive
[18:09] on our tech companies because we have
[18:11] monopolies over there and we're
[18:13] dominating, so they're putting extra
[18:14] taxes on them. His viewpoint on this
[18:18] could be okay fine then I'm going to put
[18:19] capital controls on your investments
[18:21] here because on the one side you guys
[18:23] own these companies as as shareholders
[18:26] and at the same point you're taxing
[18:29] them. So let's normalize this. You want
[18:31] to take your money out of the country.
[18:33] That's fine. Well, we're going to tax
[18:34] you on the way out since you're taxing
[18:35] revenues going back in. That's a
[18:38] simplistic way to look at it. But I
[18:39] think the reality is people have to
[18:41] remember that trade wars are capital
[18:42] wars. Russell Napier has done extensive
[18:44] good work in terms of talk on the
[18:46] history. So, I don't think what happened
[18:47] this week changes the short-term
[18:49] ramifications of the market because I
[18:50] think the market has become it doesn't
[18:53] care as much about tariffs. But I think
[18:55] what people have to be careful of again
[18:56] is that capital trolls capital controls
[18:58] are more likely on the investment arm if
[19:00] the trade side is going to be illegal.
[19:02] So, this bill the one big beautiful bill
[19:06] uh that has now come out um seems to
[19:09] have two different ramifications. One,
[19:11] it kind of breaches the subject of some
[19:13] of these capital controls which you're
[19:14] talking about. Um, we'll see if it gets
[19:16] passed, but uh, that definitely would
[19:18] ramp up maybe the abrasiveness or the
[19:20] global competition. Uh, the second thing
[19:22] that it does is, uh, I think it
[19:24] officially puts the nail in the coffin
[19:26] of cost cutting. It feels like, uh, me,
[19:30] I don't know about you, but me, uh, for
[19:31] sure, many people I know were very
[19:33] excited about Doge and, uh, the ability
[19:36] to cut government
[19:38] expenses. My general read on this
[19:41] is there's a lot to cut. they're not
[19:44] allowed to cut it. And I did an
[19:46] interview recently with a friend of mine
[19:48] who was one of the Doge engineers at uh
[19:50] the VA. And he's like, well, you know,
[19:52] we're not allowed to fire anyone. Yeah.
[19:54] You know, we did this thing and uh I
[19:56] created a better website. Literally, in
[19:58] the first day he was there, he created a
[20:00] better uh interface for I think it was
[20:02] like a mobile app or something. And he's
[20:03] like, but then they were like, well, you
[20:05] can't ship that because like there's
[20:06] this one guy who like lives off, you
[20:08] know, in the rural area. He doesn't have
[20:10] internet and like, you know, blah blah.
[20:11] And he's like, "What are we t like
[20:14] bureaucracy, right? Just like just like
[20:16] the blob at work." Um, and he was like,
[20:19] and I showed them and he's like, "I I
[20:20] got like an audience with the
[20:21] secretary." Uh, cuz they were like blown
[20:22] away. Like this guy's like knows magic.
[20:24] And he's like, "I'm using like
[20:25] offtheshelf, you know, AI coding
[20:27] software, prototyping, whatever." Um,
[20:30] he's like, to be honest, it was kind of
[20:33] what I would expect, you know, like a
[20:34] regular engineer to do on any given day
[20:36] at work.
[20:38] The bill does feel like we're regime
[20:42] changing now. And you hear it in the
[20:44] language they're using, but the bill is
[20:47] like to me that that's like the tablet
[20:49] that came down from on high that says we
[20:51] no longer are trying to cut expenses. We
[20:53] now are going to grow. Is that how you
[20:55] read it? Yes. And here's why I'll say
[20:57] yes just so quickly.
[20:59] Um Elon
[21:02] Musk took over
[21:04] Twitter. He was the trigger puller.
[21:07] everything just happened. There was no
[21:09] bureaucracy. It was just okay, get rid
[21:12] of this. Uh can't do that in the
[21:15] government. And you know, the way the
[21:18] constitution and everything was written
[21:19] up, it's really really hard. But when
[21:23] people are trying to get elected or
[21:24] reelected or whatever, and you've got so
[21:27] many of them, it actually makes it a
[21:29] bureaucracy that is almost immovable in
[21:32] a lot of ways to cut anything real. And
[21:35] so I think if you read Alon Musk's
[21:38] tweet, and I don't know if we've talked
[21:40] about this here, so I'm gonna I'm gonna
[21:41] I'm gonna open it up. We haven't we've
[21:43] never discussed this. Uh he basically
[21:45] said, "Okay, I got to go back to Tesla
[21:47] because obviously we're not going to do
[21:49] this through cutting expenses because he
[21:52] even said the deficit's going to the the
[21:54] bill's going to increase the deficit."
[21:56] Regardless of what the White House is
[21:58] going through, you've got different
[21:59] opinions. But Lon Musk said, "Okay, this
[22:01] is I got to go back to focusing on
[22:03] productivity." So, I'm just going to
[22:05] throw this out to people um because I
[22:07] don't think people realize that
[22:08] government spending, let's just take the
[22:10] number of about $6
[22:12] trillion. Do you realize that half of
[22:14] that is related to health and aging?
[22:18] Half. So, Social Security and aging
[22:21] thing and then Medicare and Medicaid.
[22:23] So, just those alone, you're about at $3
[22:25] trillion.
[22:27] So if the AI guys are right and
[22:31] longevity is about to enter the
[22:33] exponential zone, the way that this will
[22:35] eventually be dealt with in my opinion
[22:38] is through the health of the country,
[22:39] the productivity that's going to happen
[22:41] through that. So Alon Musk is focused
[22:44] more on the productivity from a
[22:45] humanoids basis from making the country
[22:47] more efficient, being able to grow GDP
[22:49] without less labor or cost, whatever the
[22:52] case is, and moving the cost of goods
[22:54] closer to zero. So whenever people go
[22:56] well there'll be no jobs in Alon Mus
[22:57] world he's like well no no no no you
[22:59] won't have to work because the cost will
[23:00] be going down equivalent to the ability
[23:02] for us to be more productive through
[23:04] humanoids and things like that but I
[23:06] think the health side people are going
[23:07] to have to start focusing on because I
[23:09] do think the Medicare and Medicaid thing
[23:11] if you made people more healthy if you
[23:14] eliminated diseases over the course of
[23:16] the next 5 years and that's not me
[23:18] talking about this is this is Deis Habis
[23:21] at deep mind saying yeah I think we can
[23:23] get to the point that within 5 years
[23:25] will have the
[23:27] ability to cure diseases at at a at a
[23:30] pace people understand. Dario Modi, same
[23:32] same thing. Ray Kurszwell. So I think
[23:34] when people look at this and they look
[23:36] back for the next 5 years, it's really
[23:38] difficult to take down the deficit. So
[23:39] the pressure on bonds will be there,
[23:40] everything. But for people looking for a
[23:42] hopeful side, I do think if they really
[23:44] analyze this, if we can make people
[23:46] healthier and we can make people live
[23:47] longer, the deficit problem will get
[23:49] much better over
[23:51] time. If that deficit problem does
[23:53] improve, what is the impact on financial
[23:55] assets?
[23:58] See th this is a
[24:00] a question that I'm going to use Tom Lee
[24:03] as an
[24:05] example. So Tom Lee gets I think
[24:08] um ridiculed a little too much as a
[24:11] permable. His long-term structural
[24:13] argument to me is very sound which is we
[24:16] have a massive labor shortage and he's
[24:18] talking about millions of people. If you
[24:20] want to go look up again Alon Musk,
[24:23] about every month he puts out a tweet
[24:25] saying we're gonna have a collapse of
[24:27] the civilization if the birth rate
[24:30] doesn't change of the developed worlds,
[24:32] which is true. I mean, we're at a point
[24:34] where the labor force is an issue and
[24:36] below the replacement rate. Yeah. And
[24:38] without immigration, the country, I
[24:40] mean, I've gone through the numbers, we
[24:42] lose about 300,000 people in the labor
[24:44] force. So, when everyone's talking about
[24:46] there's going to be a recession, people
[24:47] are going to lose jobs. I'm like, right
[24:48] now we got a problem. We're losing
[24:49] 300,000 people just from the fact that
[24:50] we don't have enough to replace the
[24:52] people that are either retiring or dying
[24:53] off, like it's a problem. And so when
[24:56] you get into kind of this this theme of
[25:00] all right, how are we going to deal with
[25:01] it? Tom Lee basically says we actually
[25:04] need the productivity to be there. So
[25:06] he's calling for massive gains in the
[25:07] stock market because what he's talking
[25:08] about is replacing the compensation
[25:11] expense size of humans with technology.
[25:14] Not by firing the people, but by the
[25:16] natural if 300,000 people are coming off
[25:18] a year instead of needing to go find the
[25:22] people to you're replacing those with
[25:24] robotics and AI agents and productivity,
[25:26] the margin should continue to improve.
[25:28] And that's what we've seen. And I think
[25:30] we're at that moment because we've
[25:32] talked about inference that people have
[25:34] to start to focus on the fact that
[25:35] inference is the key change. It's the
[25:39] thing that allows AI to impact. Fact, I
[25:41] wrote I wrote something for 22V this
[25:42] week on Disney as a company and just the
[25:46] amount of places that the company is
[25:47] working on AI being integral to their
[25:50] profit margins going forward. And so if
[25:52] you just take Disney as an example and
[25:53] you're like, okay, V3 come V3 comes out.
[25:56] Well, that could help reduce the cost of
[25:57] making the movies that they're putting
[25:59] out. They can do personalized ads and
[26:01] things like that. The way Netflix has
[26:02] kind of dominated this stuff through
[26:04] because they have a lot of the channels.
[26:05] They have these brands that will last
[26:07] forever and they're handed down from
[26:08] generation to generation. Disney has
[26:10] that ability, but the parks themselves,
[26:12] having humanoids to replace some of the
[26:13] characters, being able to use VR and
[26:15] technology that makes people
[26:16] entertained, there's just so many ways
[26:18] that they can reduce the cost over time.
[26:21] And so instead of firing people, it's a
[26:23] revenue per employee thing that I think
[26:25] is going to happen. So to your your
[26:26] question, I think big companies that can
[26:28] afford the AI side, they're going to
[26:31] benefit dramatically in the short run,
[26:32] but I do think the startup world is
[26:34] going to compete with the coding
[26:36] businesses. Uh, and the losers in this
[26:39] unfortunately are the inefficient
[26:41] smaller businesses that are sensitive to
[26:43] debt because I don't think yields are
[26:45] coming down for the near term and I
[26:47] don't think they have the culture or the
[26:48] money to spend on AI and so they're kind
[26:50] of in the vice grips of these two forces
[26:52] of higher rates and technology. So, with
[26:55] the V3, um, we were looking at it and
[26:58] I'm fortunate that I have a very expert
[27:01] video uh, uh, analysor uh, here, Matt.
[27:06] And, um, Matt was showing me things.
[27:09] It's a nice thing to say about Matt.
[27:10] You've never you never never say
[27:11] anything nice about Matt on the
[27:13] Congratulations, Matt. Um, is
[27:16] uh, there was this director online and
[27:18] she was pointing out and and Matt and I
[27:20] were pretty blown away. Um, there was a
[27:22] video and you could see the reflection
[27:24] of a hand in the glass while she was
[27:27] filming or there was another part of a
[27:30] video where it actually changed the
[27:32] exposure. So, it made you know you like
[27:34] the sun is there, it's too bright in the
[27:36] back and then all of a sudden you can
[27:37] now see the sky. Okay, those are expert
[27:42] level type touches that the AI is able
[27:45] to figure out to make it seem ultra
[27:47] realistic.
[27:49] I was telling you earlier that um I
[27:52] remember years ago walking through the
[27:54] streets of New York City and had kind of
[27:58] like this weird epiphany where I was
[28:00] like none of these people know or
[28:03] understand about Bitcoin and Bitcoin was
[28:05] at a much lower price and I was like oh
[28:07] my god they like I you just want to
[28:09] shake them right and I I I just thought
[28:12] of the big short movie where he's
[28:13] walking around he's like nobody knows
[28:14] nobody knows
[28:17] right V uh V3 to me feels like the same
[28:22] moment where you're you're like you saw
[28:24] into the future, right? Nobody gets this
[28:27] yet. There's a very small group of like
[28:30] terminally online people who are like,
[28:34] whoa. But the rest of the world, they
[28:37] have no clue. And now maybe I can do a
[28:40] big reveal with you here. Today's

[29:31] Before you continue, I want you to know
[29:32] about a brand new show called From the
[29:34] Desk of Anthony Pompiano. I sit down at
[29:36] my desk every single morning and I
[29:38] explain what I think about current
[29:39] events. It's a great show that hopefully
[29:41] will keep you informed and entertained
[29:43] to a little bit. And so if you go all
[29:44] the way over to the other channel, From
[29:46] the Desk of Anthony Pompiano on YouTube,
[29:48] Rumble X, and every other platform, From
[29:50] the Desk of Anthony Papiano is a show
[29:52] that'll keep you informed about all
[29:54] things financial markets, general
[29:55] business, pop culture, and of course,
[29:57] Bitcoin. I'll see you guys over there.
[29:59] Now, let's get back into this episode.
[30:00] Maybe I can do a big reveal with you
[30:02] here. For the last three days, Mhm. I
[30:06] have been running an experiment on X
[30:09] where I have uploaded a photo that is AI
[30:12] generated. First one was of me and
[30:14] Michael Jordan sitting courtside at the
[30:16] Knicks game. Second one was me and Tom
[30:18] Brady in a golf cart on a golf course.
[30:20] And the third one was me and Tiger Woods
[30:22] at a charity
[30:24] event. More than 50% of people, probably
[30:28] 60% or so if I had to guess, think
[30:29] they're
[30:30] real. This is the worst that techn is
[30:33] going to be. Yep. It only gets better
[30:35] from here. And so if you think about
[30:38] that, I didn't say anything in the
[30:40] image. I didn't, right? I just posted
[30:42] the image. If we're already at more than
[30:44] 50% of people can't tell on first glance
[30:47] scrolling through a social media feed,
[30:49] what is this going to be like in 10? I
[30:51] mean, this is insane. I actually don't
[30:53] know what all the ramifications are to
[30:54] you.
[30:56] No, I I remember the first time I did a
[30:58] podcast on this, by the way. What What
[31:00] did you use? I think it's important. Wh
[31:03] which um AI do you remember what you
[31:05] used? Um I think I was playing around
[31:08] with a couple different ones, but I
[31:09] think we ended up using uh Grock. Okay.
[31:13] For uh uh for those three. Okay. The
[31:16] reason the reason I ask and and by the
[31:18] way, I'm an equal opportunist. I use
[31:19] them all. All my friends work at all the
[31:21] different models. I was like, "Hey, you
[31:22] better be using I use all the models for
[31:24] all kinds of different things." That one
[31:25] was Grock. I'm I I do I use all of them
[31:28] for all different things and I've been
[31:29] on all of them within the last 24 hours.
[31:31] every single one of them. Um, a lot of
[31:33] times I do one and one and then I have a
[31:35] check in another to make sure that it
[31:37] it's actually uh completely eradicated
[31:39] of hallucinations. Um, so I remember the
[31:43] first time I did something on this, it
[31:44] was an argument for why the blockchain
[31:46] was so important. Meaning at some point
[31:49] you need documented proof of what's real
[31:51] and what's not real. and immediately
[31:54] like you had with NFTTS getting
[31:56] something that has a documented this is
[31:59] I created this this is what it is but
[32:02] you're never going to know for sure what
[32:04] people are printing so the reason I
[32:05] asked what it was is imagine if people
[32:08] actually did this my my issue with
[32:12] VO3 and and I'm going to I'm going to
[32:15] take your your
[32:16] Bitcoin like big short
[32:19] moment a different level I've I have
[32:22] that every day. And Wall Street still
[32:25] with
[32:27] Bitcoin. You're not in the same group of
[32:30] people that I am. It's very hard for me
[32:32] to convince anyone on Wall Street as to
[32:35] why Bitcoin is the purest AI trade, why
[32:39] Bitcoin has a role in the future.
[32:41] Everything that we talk about here, it's
[32:42] not it's not a game. It's actually you
[32:44] see it from one angle. I came to your
[32:47] side. You know about my world. I know
[32:49] about yours. And we bridge the gap. I I
[32:52] don't understand how people don't
[32:53] understand this. So, let me bring it to
[32:55] VO3. Now, I believe what this when this
[32:59] thing came out and when I used it and I
[33:01] used up all of my monthly
[33:04] aotment in about 5 minutes and I posted
[33:07] one on X, I immediately started going,
[33:10] this is not only incredible for the
[33:12] reasons you mentioned, how much compute
[33:15] did this take? And I wanted to find out
[33:17] why Google was only letting you do 8
[33:20] seconds and why you had to be on the $20
[33:23] a month for the certain amount, finite
[33:26] amount, which I used up in one day, and
[33:27] then the $250 amount. And I asked the
[33:30] question, I said, if enough people used
[33:34] it, because you remember when Jibli came
[33:35] out and you were kind of playing around
[33:36] with that and you posted something,
[33:38] that's one of the reasons why the token
[33:40] number that Sacha Nadella talked about
[33:42] was so high in March. this number if
[33:46] everyone you there's not enough GPUs.
[33:48] Yeah.
[33:49] Anywhere today. So anyone that was in
[33:52] the deepseek moment going that's it.
[33:54] We're not going to need as many GPUs.
[33:55] Got to short Nvidia. Wrong wrong. Like
[33:59] this inference moment for me cuz that's
[34:02] what this is. This is an inference
[34:03] moment. This is the beginning of the
[34:05] gateway to the embodied intelligence
[34:07] side. So this might just be a video but
[34:09] people have to understand is the way
[34:10] that this thing is doing things. Like
[34:12] literally what you said, creating the
[34:14] lighting and making it it it's doing
[34:17] thinking and reasoning at a level that
[34:19] cost a lot more. So in token terms for
[34:22] everyone who's used chat GPT or Grock
[34:24] and just type something in on average
[34:27] for a prompt, you're talking about 30 to
[34:29] 50
[34:30] tokens for the 8 second video. Not the
[34:33] audio, the video, it's 100 times that.
[34:36] Those are the numbers we're talking
[34:38] about for inference. So when everyone
[34:39] was saying, "Oh yeah, that's the end.
[34:41] We're we're at this the inference
[34:43] numbers are going to go through the roof
[34:44] because who's not going to make videos?
[34:46] I mean, it was fun. Did you you made
[34:48] some, right? Mhm. It's fun to make.
[34:50] Like, you're putting in a prompt and
[34:51] you're creating something and playing
[34:52] around. It's really fun to do. Yeah. My
[34:54] artist era.
[34:57] I was telling Matt, I want to I I want
[34:59] to do a short like 15-minute video, pay
[35:01] for the pro and and do 8sec increments
[35:05] and build a whole whole short movie out
[35:08] of it. So, I just don't think people
[35:10] realize that when you start getting into
[35:11] humanoids and you start getting into
[35:13] full self-driving and you start getting
[35:14] into anything related to the optical
[35:17] side and the inference side, you're just
[35:20] dealing with a lot more compute. We
[35:21] don't have enough GPUs. We don't have
[35:23] enough data centers. We don't have
[35:24] enough power. And that's why with
[35:26] Nvidia's like stock price, it
[35:27] consolidated for a year while everyone's
[35:30] stressed about this. V3 to me was the
[35:32] gateway to the next leg of this with
[35:34] people realizing that the token numbers
[35:36] are just going to explode. What does
[35:38] that do from a investment standpoint um
[35:41] for the Mag 7 versus um others? And and
[35:44] maybe a way to think about this is like
[35:46] if I have, you know, money and I want to
[35:49] play AI
[35:50] today, what are my options, right? I can
[35:53] go there's real estate, you know, kind
[35:55] of REIT type stuff. There's obviously
[35:57] companies like Nvidia, there's the Max
[35:58] 7. Like, how do you think about it
[36:00] today? Um, so semiconductors to me right
[36:03] off the bat, um, especially since they
[36:06] haven't done anything now for a year. So
[36:08] it wasn't just Nvidia, it was
[36:09] everything. And then after the Deep Seek
[36:11] moment, everything fell down
[36:13] significantly. I don't think people
[36:15] fully grasp what you need for what V3
[36:19] does. And if you put that if you put
[36:22] that brain inside a humanoid, the amount
[36:26] of battery needed, the electricity
[36:28] needed, the high bandwidth memory that's
[36:30] needed, the optical semiconductors,
[36:32] you're getting into old school hardware
[36:34] stuff which has really been left for
[36:36] dead. And in many cases, like Micron
[36:38] Technology is trading below a 10p off
[36:41] next year's earnings. And you have a lot
[36:43] of these things out there. The hardware
[36:45] side and the commodity side is a big
[36:47] part. We we didn't talk about it, but
[36:49] the nuclear executive orders that were
[36:51] signed last week with him saying that he
[36:53] wants to have 300 more gigawatts by 2050
[36:57] of nuclear power. I mean, a gigawatt
[37:01] cost, you know, and this is just using
[37:03] numbers that are probably not including
[37:05] the tariffs, but let's just say on
[37:07] average about $8 billion per gawatt. So
[37:10] when you're getting into 300 gawatt,
[37:12] you're talking about $2.5 trillion over
[37:14] the course of the next 25 years. Let's
[37:16] just straight line it. That's 100
[37:18] billion a year. You have the capex
[37:20] already from the hyperscalers going in
[37:21] at 300 billion a year. Like there's a
[37:24] lot of stuff and we just changed the
[37:26] bonus depreciation to allow this. Like I
[37:28] don't think people grasp the GDP impact
[37:31] um the data center side. There's cooling
[37:33] that's needed for this. There's a lot of
[37:35] plays on the AI side. And the problem is
[37:37] for people in the market if they're
[37:39] looking for other things to change like
[37:41] will Ford benefit for this? Well, if the
[37:43] company has a lot of debt and they don't
[37:46] have a benefit from AI and the
[37:48] efficiency side that's going to offset
[37:49] the the cost of this, this is really
[37:52] isolated unfortunately to the the the
[37:54] companies that are more geared towards
[37:56] AI. But I think the compute and power
[37:57] needs are the number one place that
[37:59] people should focus on. When um when you
[38:01] think of your portfolio, there's been a
[38:03] lot of changes over the last month or so
[38:05] since I've asked you this. Um what have
[38:07] you changed and what have you doubled
[38:09] down on? So the semiconductor thing was
[38:12] a big thing for me during the middle of
[38:13] the tariff. So luckily um we ended up
[38:17] being right during the middle of the
[38:18] melee. And you know as I've I've I've
[38:21] kind of said here my viewpoint on alpha
[38:24] creation has changed really since
[38:28] 2013 where I view the best alpha
[38:30] opportunities for people sitting at home
[38:32] that are investing money is that when
[38:34] recession fears are very high it is a
[38:36] great time to start putting money to
[38:38] work. And that's where the dollar cost
[38:40] averaging should start. So when you see
[38:43] the recession fears go up, it should go
[38:45] cuz it's just not possible. Um it's not
[38:47] possible. Uh the old school traditional
[38:50] recession thing is not going to happen.
[38:52] So if we just continue to grow at four
[38:54] to 5% of nominal GDP, which is I what I
[38:57] think will happen, you usually get good
[38:59] bargains on the artificial intelligence
[39:01] and the more crowded trade. So Deepc
[39:02] created the first bit of opportunity,
[39:04] but it wasn't until the recession stuff
[39:06] came up on the tariffs that you had
[39:08] these things selling. I mean, I think
[39:10] Micron I think uh Micron got down to
[39:12] about $60. It's around 100 now and
[39:15] Nvidia got down somewhere around 80 and
[39:18] it's at 140 as of yesterday. You have to
[39:22] think about those types of returns. Now,
[39:24] Nvidia is higher than it was the day
[39:27] before deepseek and it's higher than it
[39:30] was the day after deepseek. So, you
[39:32] could have bought it then, but I think
[39:34] waiting for the recession fears has been
[39:36] up. So, that's been the biggest change
[39:37] for me. I obviously also put some money
[39:39] to work in Bitcoin. And what I do is I
[39:41] just harvest some of those and I'll wait
[39:44] for the next recession. I don't think
[39:45] yet we've seen the sentiment come down
[39:47] low enough that I'd be getting out of
[39:49] anything at this point. I still believe
[39:50] we're going to make all-time highs, but
[39:52] at that point, things will change. I do
[39:54] I I did focus a lot more on Bitcoin
[39:56] because I've talked about it here. I do
[39:58] think there is a short squeeze coming in
[40:00] this issue. That's why I'm so fixated on
[40:03] what's going on with Donald Trump's uh
[40:06] decisions is number one, it's what he
[40:08] was elected on because of the
[40:10] distribution of wealth problem. So
[40:12] Bitcoin to me is number one associated
[40:15] with how do we fix this distribution of
[40:17] wealth problem not just in the US but
[40:19] globally. While these guys are all
[40:21] fighting from a government level over
[40:23] tariffs and this and that, that is not
[40:24] the story. The story is the distribution
[40:26] of wealth problem which will continue to
[40:28] be exacerbated by the artificial
[40:30] intelligence side. Artificial
[40:31] intelligence will help everyone in the
[40:33] country through higher profit margins
[40:35] and stock prices being able to hold up,
[40:36] not having recessions so people will be
[40:38] able to get jobs. So, it's not this
[40:40] horrible thing. If people at home are in
[40:42] that bracket where they're like, I can
[40:44] barely survive, you got to start
[40:46] putting, in my opinion, some money into
[40:48] Bitcoin as kind of the hope side, but
[40:50] also on the belief that as these systems
[40:52] go through this, this is the way it's
[40:54] going to work out. I um I tend to agree.
[40:58] I also think that uh you and I were on
[41:02] an island when stocks were going down.
[41:05] Now that it has shifted, I do find it
[41:08] fascinating that retail is buying and
[41:09] institutions still are pretty unexposed
[41:12] to this equity rally. Um, and in a weird
[41:16] way, Wall Street's too smart. That's
[41:18] what it is. They're looking at all these
[41:20] nuanced data points, all this stuff. I
[41:21] have some friends who work in these
[41:22] hedge funds. Uh, and I was talking to
[41:24] one of them recently, and he was saying
[41:26] stuff to me, and I literally just looked
[41:27] him open. I said, "Dude, you're speaking
[41:29] another language right now. I I like
[41:30] everything you're saying, I'm sure,
[41:31] makes sense, but whatever.
[41:33] let me explain to you how I think the
[41:35] world works. Assets go down, buy because
[41:39] assets are coming back up. And he was
[41:42] like, "Yeah, but the you know, Warren
[41:45] Buffett indicator, he was uh going
[41:46] through the PE ratio." I said, "Dude, I
[41:49] I get all of that." And there are
[41:51] certain stocks that are overvalued
[41:52] versus undervalued, and you can get into
[41:54] the nuance of valuations, but on a macro
[41:57] basis, bare markets have been outlawed.
[42:00] Yeah. And I could just see like there
[42:01] was like smoke coming out of his ears,
[42:03] right? He was like, "What do you mean?"
[42:04] Whatever. And I was just like, "Look,
[42:05] man. I'm just telling you on a broad
[42:08] basis what's happening." And that's why
[42:10] retail's buying. Um, there was a phrase
[42:12] I heard yesterday on a podcast. Uh, and
[42:16] I'll give a shout out to the Forward
[42:17] Guidance podcast. They their weekly one
[42:20] at the end is good. And the reason it's
[42:22] good is because they're rational. But
[42:23] this one guy said, "I'm so bearish. I'm
[42:27] bullish." And that that line to me is so
[42:30] true because they talk about if it reads
[42:34] this bad, if it seems this bad,
[42:36] somewhere with inside the system, the
[42:38] government is going to print money.
[42:40] That's it. And so when you're a Bitcoin
[42:42] person, you believe that that's the
[42:45] endgame is that the system has been made
[42:48] to make sure that the average voter is
[42:50] not going to be hurt. And that average
[42:51] voter stops Doge. Yep. That average
[42:54] voter stops job losses. that average it
[42:57] it's just the way it is. Where can we
[42:58] send people to uh to find you on the
[43:00] internet? People can reach out to me,
[43:02] Investor Labs. I'm doing a lot more work
[43:04] on there directly for people to help
[43:06] them with AI and transitioning on it. Uh
[43:09] some people on the Bitcoin side and then
[43:11] 22V Securities now on their website. I
[43:14] do a lot of deep dive research on there
[43:16] for them. And then they can find me on X
[43:18] and YouTube. Uh next time I want to make
[43:20] sure we talk about quantum. If there's
[43:23] one thing that I'm sick of dealing with
[43:26] with people scared of Bitcoin, it's that
[43:28] quantum is coming. Make sure you
[43:30] subscribe to the channel for next
[43:32] Saturday. Talk to you guys next week.
