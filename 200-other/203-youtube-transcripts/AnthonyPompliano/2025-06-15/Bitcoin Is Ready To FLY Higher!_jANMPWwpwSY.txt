[00:00] What's going on, guys? Today we've got
[00:01] an excellent episode with Darius Dale.
[00:03] He's the founder and CEO of 42 Macro, my
[00:06] favorite Wall Street advisory firm. They
[00:09] do fantastic research. And as you know,
[00:11] Darius always brings the heat. In this
[00:13] conversation, we talk about why Bitcoin,
[00:16] gold, and stocks, things that used to be
[00:18] called risk assets, maybe actually
[00:20] they're exactly what you need in your
[00:21] portfolio during a time where the dollar
[00:23] and bonds are getting their butts
[00:25] kicked. On top of that, he explains to
[00:27] us exactly what's happening in the
[00:28] Treasury market, what's going on with
[00:30] China, Japan, Europe, and much more.
[00:32] Darius always brings information that
[00:34] teaches me something, and this
[00:35] conversation is no different. Here's my
[00:37] latest conversation with Darius Dale.
[00:39] And here we go. Darius, breaking news
[00:43] right as we're about to record this.
[00:45] Elon Musk, the world's richest man, the
[00:48] man who has been slashing government
[00:50] spending, literally living out of a
[00:53] closet essentially in the
[00:54] administration, just tweeted, "I'm
[00:56] sorry, but I just can't stand it
[00:58] anymore. The massive, outrageous, pork-
[01:01] fililled congressional spending bill is
[01:03] a disgusting abomination. Shame on those
[01:06] who voted for it. You know you did
[01:08] wrong. You know it." Reaction. What do
[01:12] you think? I told you, man. I've been
[01:15] trying to tell y'all this is uh this
[01:17] train has left the barn. It's left the
[01:19] station. Um you know it's it's so I'll
[01:21] start by saying uh one, thank you for
[01:23] sharing that. Two, thank you for having
[01:24] me. Three, this is exactly what we were
[01:27] warning about last fall when we said
[01:29] Doge is this Kabuki theater process
[01:31] that's designed to distract a very
[01:34] gullible American public from trillions
[01:36] of dollars of debt finance tax cuts and
[01:38] not nearly enough um expenditure
[01:41] reductions to offset that. So, uh, it's
[01:43] great to see to welcome Elon to this
[01:45] side of the aisle. Uh, this the purple
[01:47] side of the aisle. Should have worn my
[01:48] purple tie today. Uh, I think Elon, you,
[01:51] me, folks like us, we're doing our best
[01:54] to try to save off what it could
[01:55] potentially be a real erosion of US, you
[01:59] know, borrowing power and borrowing
[02:00] authority in in the coming years as a
[02:02] function of our uh, fiscal uh, our
[02:04] inability, our fiscal house in order.
[02:06] So, thank you, Elon, for calling it out.
[02:08] So, you've got this chart here that says
[02:10] the congressional Republicans inability
[02:12] to dramatically cut spending. It's
[02:14] basically exactly what Elon is calling
[02:16] out. What is this chart showing us and
[02:18] what are your takeaways? Yeah. No,
[02:20] totally. I'm just grabbing this chart
[02:22] from our monthly macro scouting report.
[02:24] We've showing this chart for years to
[02:25] our clients. Um, you know, look, what
[02:28] I'm essentially calling out is the fact
[02:29] that something I I we identified a
[02:32] couple years ago in the context of our
[02:33] investing in a fortune regime analysis,
[02:35] which is both parties are addicted to
[02:38] fiscal RS. On one side of the equation,
[02:40] you have the the Democrats and their
[02:42] profitate fiscal spending and their
[02:44] aggressive overreach in terms of uh
[02:46] regulation and spending. I mean, on one
[02:47] side of the aisle, you have uh folks who
[02:49] just do bad math and don't understand
[02:50] that, hey, if you lose revenues andor if
[02:54] you uh have a deficit that's 7% and you
[02:57] don't grow nominally 7%, you're going to
[02:59] wind up with a debt to GDP ratio that
[03:00] continues to h to to go higher. So, on
[03:03] one side of the aisle, you got people
[03:04] who can't stop spending. On the other
[03:05] side of the aisle, you got people who
[03:07] can't do high school math, and you wind
[03:08] up with, you know, just this, you know,
[03:10] ever never ending, you know, debt and
[03:12] deficit situation. So, Doge was saying
[03:14] they were going to cut a trillion, two
[03:16] trillion. And there's big numbers out
[03:17] there. Um I don't know if people ever
[03:19] thought they were actually going to cut
[03:20] two trillion, but they thought they're
[03:22] definitely going to cut a good amount.
[03:24] Um you've got a chart here that says we
[03:26] told you that even if Doge cuts $1
[03:27] trillion of federal expenditures, it
[03:30] ain't going to fix nothing. Yeah, this
[03:32] was always my my my biggest point of
[03:34] contention uh with Doge. You know,
[03:35] obviously I support Doge, the concept of
[03:37] Doge, what Doge is trying to do, but to
[03:40] me, again, I always thought it was a
[03:42] very calculated distraction from what
[03:44] actually needs to happen, which is
[03:47] legitimate fiscal austerity, right? If
[03:49] you float in a trillion, and so we were
[03:51] in the camp going back to last fall that
[03:53] hey, Elon's not going to get anywhere
[03:55] near $2 trillion, not $2 trillion of
[03:57] waste in the federal budget. Uh maybe
[03:59] they'll get up to$1 trillion. We we we
[04:01] we specifically identified $550 billion
[04:03] of things they could cut back then.
[04:06] Obviously, they stopped well shy of
[04:07] that, but we said, "Hey, let's just, you
[04:09] know, give them full credit of the
[04:10] benefit of the doubt. Let's say we float
[04:12] an entire trillion dollars of federal
[04:13] expenditure reduction all the way down
[04:14] to the bottom line." What would that do
[04:16] in debt deficit to GDP terms? Well,
[04:18] you'd wind up from you go from a 7%
[04:21] budget deficit to GDP to a 5% budget
[04:23] deficit to GDP. And again, this exercise
[04:26] does not include any negative
[04:27] ramifications upon the economy via tax
[04:29] receipts. And it also is pre-p proforma
[04:33] prior to the uh one big ugly bill that
[04:36] is now adding uh incremental um debt to
[04:38] the debt to deficits to the debt. So uh
[04:41] you know this US fiscal situation is a
[04:43] real issue. I mean you look at the last
[04:44] couple of years, the deficit grew by
[04:46] $250 billion in 2024 after growing $365
[04:50] billion uh in 2023. It's probably going
[04:53] to shrink a bit because of tariff
[04:54] revenues in 2025, but in my opinion,
[04:56] that's more of a transitory shock
[04:58] because again, once you walk into 2026,
[04:59] you're going to start to wind that um
[05:01] that that sucker back up again. Now, uh
[05:04] I think I heard a translation in there.
[05:06] Uh I think they call it the one big
[05:08] beautiful bill. You called it the one
[05:09] big ugly bill. So does Elon. Can a big
[05:13] be beautiful and big in the context of
[05:15] our starting point? Go back to that
[05:17] first chart, Matt. Put the first chart
[05:18] back on the screen. You look at the US's
[05:21] federal expenditures as a percent of
[05:23] nominal GDP at 24%. We are at like
[05:27] crisis financial crisis type levels of
[05:30] federal expenditures. Go back to the GFC
[05:32] when everybody was unemployed and we're
[05:34] handing out unemployment checks and
[05:36] everybody was on Medicaid and SNAP and
[05:38] everything else. We that's the kind of
[05:40] that's the kind of expenditures that we
[05:42] have now. So America clearly voted for
[05:45] the congressional Republican party to
[05:46] come in and fix this. Well, now that
[05:48] they're sitting in the driver's seat,
[05:50] they're like, "You know what? This pork
[05:51] tastes kind of good."
[05:54] You know, that's for lack of a better
[05:56] word. Yeah. China, they having a blast
[06:00] right now. They seem to uh Oh, the
[06:03] world's distracted. Let us make some
[06:04] moves. What are they doing? Yeah. No.
[06:06] Well, look, I tell you what, man. Uh,
[06:09] never underestimate your enemy. That's
[06:11] what page one of Sunzu. Uh page two of
[06:14] Sunzu is probably never underestimate
[06:16] the Chinese dynasty because these people
[06:17] are always plotting and scheming. Um you
[06:20] know I have no I I'm hopeful that the US
[06:23] wins this geopolitical strategic
[06:25] conflict but as evidenced by our
[06:27] inability to cut um federal expenditures
[06:30] from extreme levels to suggest that we
[06:32] are we're not even playing in the right
[06:33] game, right? Like they're they're
[06:35] playing go andor chess and we're setting
[06:37] up a checker board, right? In my
[06:39] opinion. So what this chart shows uh is
[06:41] the uh US imports from various um from
[06:44] various countries uh just to track the
[06:46] share of imports and how they've evolved
[06:47] over time. And what we see from China is
[06:50] that um US imports from China are now 9%
[06:54] of total imports and that's one month of
[06:56] data from from the month of April. If
[06:57] you look at it on a trailing 10 uh
[06:59] trailing one-year uh basis, it's it's
[07:01] 13%. That 13% is down from a peak of 24%
[07:05] back in 2015. So the share of imports
[07:08] that we get from China continues to
[07:10] decline, which ultimately means the
[07:13] amount of dollars that China needs to
[07:15] reinvest in the Treasury market will
[07:17] continue to decline as a share of the
[07:19] total amount of marketable treasury
[07:21] securities, especially in the context of
[07:23] our deficit situation that we can't seem
[07:25] to get under control. So this is a a
[07:28] world in which you have one of the main
[07:30] capital uh one of the main investors in
[07:32] the US Treasury market, China being the
[07:34] number three economy. I think they own 3
[07:36] to 4% total of the market of the
[07:37] Treasury market. You know, they they
[07:39] just will need to reinvest and recycle
[07:41] dollars into the Treasury market at a
[07:42] lower and lower frequency going forward.
[07:44] What about Europe and Japan? Yeah, it's
[07:46] the same it's the same dynamic for
[07:48] different reasons. Um so with respect to
[07:50] uh Europe and Japan, they currently have
[07:53] economic incentive to repatriate capital
[07:55] from the Treasury bomber. China has
[07:56] incentive to stop investing at the same
[07:58] rate which is a problem when you have
[08:00] you know budget deficits that need to
[08:01] you know constantly be capitalized. we
[08:03] need to capitalize somewhere between 6
[08:06] to 7% of US GDP's worth budget deficits
[08:09] every year. Uh and so if you have you
[08:11] have one major um investor cohort
[08:14] pulling away that's China from strategic
[08:16] decoupling standpoint and then you have
[08:18] our other two um investors the two big
[08:20] investors Europe owns I want to say
[08:22] somewhere close to eight or nine% of the
[08:24] marketable treasury market when you
[08:25] aggregate the Euro zone economies Japan
[08:26] owns about four to 5% total. So you know
[08:28] this is a big swath of the US treasury
[08:31] market from a foreign ownership
[08:32] perspective and uh with respect to US
[08:34] with respect to European and and
[08:36] Japanese investors you know it's no
[08:37] longer economic for them to invest in
[08:39] treasuries right if you look at the the
[08:42] the yield the the the the spread between
[08:45] the spread that and the European-based
[08:47] investors get for for investing in
[08:49] treasuries let's say the 10-year nominal
[08:51] Treasury yield once you hedge out the
[08:53] the the currency risk from their from
[08:55] their perspective they get they're
[08:57] losing 83 3 basis points relative to
[08:58] their home market. Japan, you're losing
[09:01] 107 basis points relative to your home
[09:03] market. So, you would make, you know,
[09:05] 200 2.89% if you're a European-based
[09:08] investor and just investing in the, you
[09:09] know, 10-year, you know, weighted
[09:11] average European, you know, yields. You
[09:13] would make 1.49% if you're a Japanese
[09:15] investor investing in the JGB market.
[09:17] You would actually lose 83 basis points
[09:19] and 107 basis points, respectively,
[09:21] relative to those uh to those numbers.
[09:23] So it doesn't make any economic sense
[09:25] for uh this pocket of you know I guess I
[09:27] would say friendly investors to continue
[09:29] uh investing in the tre treasury market
[09:31] at the same speed which is a problem
[09:33] because again you're talking about the
[09:34] three largest sources of external demand
[09:36] for our marketable treasury market all
[09:38] moving in the wrong direction at the
[09:40] same time congressional Republicans are
[09:42] legislating the one big ugly bill. Let's
[09:44] jump to the US public sector and they
[09:46] seem to be already consuming a
[09:48] historically large share of the world's
[09:50] capital. It seems like uh on one hand it
[09:53] could be good, but maybe not what people
[09:55] think it is. Today's episode is brought

[11:56] jump to the US public sector and they
[11:58] seem to be already consuming a
[12:00] historically large share of the world's
[12:02] capital. It seems like uh on one hand it
[12:05] could be good but maybe not what people
[12:07] think it is. Oh, it's definitely not
[12:09] good.
[12:11] Sorry, let me be very very clear about
[12:12] this. Uh, so again, you have Europe
[12:15] remilitarizing which is going to, you
[12:17] know, essentially be a capital call for
[12:19] their economy, for the German economy
[12:21] and for other economies across Europe.
[12:23] You have Japan's monetary policy
[12:24] normalization continuing. Um, you still
[12:26] have persistent above targeted uh growth
[12:28] in inflation and above target and above
[12:30] trend growth in inflation in Japan with
[12:32] no end to that in sight. So the BOJ was
[12:34] out overnight essentially confirming
[12:36] that their QT program is going to extend
[12:38] indefinitely uh into into uh fiscal 2026
[12:42] which starts fiscal 2027 which starts in
[12:43] April of next year. Uh and then
[12:45] obviously we talked about with respect
[12:47] to China strategic decoupling. You all
[12:49] these are three major geopolitical
[12:52] forces that essentially represents a
[12:53] negative demand shock for US Treasury
[12:56] debt and that's a problem in the context
[12:57] of the following two statistics. one,
[13:00] the US already has more public sector
[13:02] debt than it can capitalize with its own
[13:04] internally generated capital. Um, if you
[13:07] look at the US's debt to liquidity
[13:09] ratio, we're at 114%. That means we have
[13:12] 114% of US public sector debt relative
[13:14] to the amount of US domestic liquidity.
[13:18] If you want to compare that to other our
[13:19] peer economies like Europe at 61%, Japan
[13:21] at 61%, China's at 31%. So we're nowhere
[13:24] near in the area code of what a healthy
[13:27] debt to liquidity ratio would look like.
[13:29] And moreover, if you look at US public
[13:30] sector debt uh as a share of global
[13:32] public sector debt, it's now 35%.
[13:35] It was what 24% back in back in, you
[13:38] know, but essentially, you know, 20
[13:39] years ago. And so, you know, we, you
[13:41] know, it's been this kind of one-way
[13:43] move higher in terms of how much of the
[13:45] world's capital we've been gobbling up.
[13:47] Uh, and you know, I'm not calling for an
[13:49] imminent crisis collapse or anything,
[13:51] but again, I think this is all part and
[13:53] parcel to what our long-term conclusion
[13:54] has been on the next slide, which is the
[13:57] risk asset is the Treasury bond market.
[14:00] It's not stocks, it's not gold, it's not
[14:02] Bitcoin. And that's exactly what the
[14:04] market's telling you uh today from a
[14:06] year-to- date performance perspective.
[14:07] Stocks up 2%. Bitcoin up 13%, gold up
[14:10] 28%. And this is versus the dollar
[14:12] that's down uh 7% and Treasury bonds
[14:15] that are down 3%. Again, you need to
[14:18] freeze frame that performance spread or
[14:20] those those relative performance of
[14:22] those risk assets versus those
[14:23] traditionally defensive assets and just
[14:26] remember that every time the market is
[14:28] down for the now until we get through
[14:30] the end of this fourth turning poly
[14:31] prices. I would keep saying I don't know
[14:34] for how long now why would you consider
[14:36] bonds safe if they're guaranteed to lose
[14:39] value? It makes no sense to me. It's
[14:41] crazy to me that people are still
[14:43] running around talking about I'm going
[14:44] to bonds, I'm going to cash, I'm going
[14:45] like So, you think the safest asset in
[14:48] your portfolio is the thing that's
[14:49] guaranteed to lose value? By the way,
[14:51] other things could go down, but at least
[14:53] you got a shot that they're not going to
[14:54] go down. Totally. The bonds and the
[14:57] dollars are guaranteed. There's no shot
[14:59] that they're going up in value over
[15:00] time. Yeah. Well, I wouldn't say no shot
[15:02] because there's obviously a distribution
[15:03] of outcomes, but again, it's a very
[15:05] negatively skewed distribution for those
[15:06] assets, right? That's the problem,
[15:08] right? like it's we there is a
[15:11] geopolitically driven supply demand
[15:13] imbalance in the treasury market. We
[15:16] have less demand and more supply and
[15:19] neither political party here in the
[15:20] United States of America has has any
[15:23] real political will to fix it. And so
[15:25] this is why if we go to the the final
[15:27] slide, you know, this is something we
[15:28] continue to pound the table on to our
[15:30] client base and to retail investors all
[15:32] around the world, which is the best way
[15:34] to be exposed to financial market risk,
[15:37] certainly throughout the duration of a
[15:38] foring poly crisis, is via risk assets
[15:42] because there are very limited levers
[15:44] that the sovereign can pull to get
[15:46] itself out of this mess. There's grow
[15:49] your way out of the mess, there's print
[15:50] your way out of the mess, or there's cut
[15:52] your way out of the mess from a fiscal
[15:53] austerity perspective. We just saw their
[15:56] willingness to do number three is very
[15:57] low. So guess what they're going to try?
[15:59] Number two, grow their way out of the
[16:01] mess. When that fails, guess what
[16:03] they're going to do?
[16:05] Print their way out of the mess. I know
[16:06] exactly what they're going to do. I
[16:09] mean, here's the crazy thing. You know
[16:09] what I've been saying? This is bad for
[16:12] my country. This is good for my
[16:13] portfolio. Yeah, 100%. that that is
[16:16] going to be the next decade or so of uh
[16:18] what we're probably going to face here
[16:20] is it's bad for my country, it's good
[16:21] for my portfolio. And the people on the
[16:23] internet understand that better than the
[16:24] people in the institutions and it seems
[16:26] like the retail investors is just buy
[16:28] every dip, deploy capital, just keep
[16:30] throwing money into the market because
[16:33] the alternative of cash bonds not good.
[16:36] I don't know institutions, there's
[16:38] plenty of them that are going to make
[16:38] money, right? They're not dumb. They're
[16:40] working hard. Um but it does seem like
[16:42] more of them are sitting on the
[16:43] sidelines than you would otherwise think
[16:45] considering what retail's doing. Yeah,
[16:47] we can observe that in our positioning
[16:48] model. We track 12 or 15 different
[16:50] indicators across, you know, from
[16:52] long-term time with the long-term time
[16:54] series and we can see that none of those
[16:55] indicators is even close to where they
[16:57] were in the um at the February highs. Uh
[16:59] I obviously talked to institutional
[17:00] clients. We have eyes on $25 trillion
[17:02] worth of institutional client AUM. I'm
[17:04] talking to institutional investors every
[17:06] single day of the week, including
[17:07] Sundays. some days then none to a person
[17:10] no one is fully invested. It certainly
[17:12] has the like they were uh back at the
[17:14] highs of February. So you know we're
[17:15] going to continue to pound the table on
[17:17] our paradigm C thesis which is hey
[17:19] they're going to try to grow their way
[17:21] out and eventually they'll wind up
[17:22] trying to print their way out once that
[17:24] fails. Uh and until then you just need
[17:26] to stay focused on the three asset
[17:28] classes that matter from the perspective
[17:30] of retiring on time and comfortably as a
[17:32] retail investor. Stocks, gold, Bitcoin.
[17:34] Your job is to be maxed long those
[17:37] assets until you get a riskmanagement
[17:39] signal that tells you to take raise cash
[17:42] so that you can do the most important
[17:43] thing I think most in retail investors
[17:45] should be doing if they want to retire
[17:47] on time and comfortably which is avoid
[17:49] volatility drag. And that's what this
[17:50] chart shows is that if you can
[17:53] reasonably consistently sell somewhere
[17:56] near the top, you're never going to sell
[17:58] the exact top. So somewhere near the top
[18:01] right out of bull bare market and buy
[18:03] somewhere near the bottom. You don't
[18:05] have to buy. You're never going to buy
[18:06] the exact bottom unless it's pure luck
[18:09] and buy somewhere near the bottom. Even
[18:11] it could be 10 20% off the bottom. is if
[18:13] you truncate, if you take out that that
[18:16] negative alpha, that negative beta from
[18:18] your portfolio and you do that
[18:19] consistently, what you're going to wind
[18:21] up happening is you're going to compound
[18:23] your portfolio from higher levels of net
[18:25] asset value and you're going to see your
[18:27] the money that you have in your account
[18:29] widen relative to everyone else who's
[18:31] not doing that. So, uh, this is why we
[18:33] continue to pound the table in our
[18:35] institutional risk management frameworks
[18:36] that we feature in our KISS portfolio
[18:38] construction process, which is stocks,
[18:40] gold, Bitcoin, no bonds. Hey, you ain't
[18:44] going to convince me. I I've been
[18:46] telling people that Bitcoin is the new
[18:48] bond, right? Think about it from that
[18:50] perspective. Sure. Uh, people are like,
[18:52] "Oh, but I don't get my uh my interest
[18:54] payment." Who cares? Well, just you're
[18:56] getting a negative interest payment
[18:58] because you're losing money on the on
[19:01] the actual uh uh principal. Like what
[19:03] are you doing? We're going to re you
[19:05] pump. You and I are going to
[19:06] revolutionize the way a lot of investors
[19:08] approach financial market risk. Um you
[19:09] know, our cl clients tend to skew older
[19:12] and richer because they they tend to be
[19:14] more focused on risk management, but
[19:16] again, at some point, the people that
[19:18] you and I are talking to will be 10
[19:19] years older and 10 years richer, and
[19:21] they're going to start to care about
[19:22] risk management as well. So, uh, I'm
[19:24] glad that you've been pounding the table
[19:26] on Bitcoin and and and and helping folks
[19:28] like me get comfortable with the asset
[19:29] class so we can turn around and and help
[19:31] other people get comfortable with the
[19:32] asset class because to me it's one of
[19:33] the only ways out. Could not agree more.
