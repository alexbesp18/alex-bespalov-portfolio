[00:00] the demand is coming in from these
[00:01] corporations and and retail hasn't
[00:03] really even started yet. This is the
[00:05] most hated rally I've ever seen, right?
[00:07] Well, there's Google search volume is
[00:09] low. Media, they're they're mentioning
[00:11] it, but it's not mania by any means,
[00:13] right? And uh it definitely feels like
[00:15] uh you can talk to multiple people
[00:16] throughout a day and if you're like,
[00:17] "Oh, Bitcoin's back at an all-time
[00:18] high." Some of them know, but a lot of
[00:20] them don't. Historically, the two ways
[00:22] that we were able to determine whether
[00:23] this rally was retail loved or hated was
[00:27] What's going on, guys? Today we've got
[00:28] an excellent episode with Bill
[00:29] Barheight. He's the founder and CEO of
[00:31] Abra. Abra is a RAIA that is
[00:33] specifically focused on helping high-
[00:35] netw worth individuals do things with
[00:37] their crypto, store it, borrow against
[00:39] it, earn yield, etc. It's all financial
[00:41] services that you get in the traditional
[00:42] world, but now you can get it inside of
[00:44] Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. In this
[00:46] conversation, we talk about a lot,
[00:47] including what's going on in the macro
[00:48] environment, tariffs, Bitcoin, Bitcoin
[00:51] all-time high, what's going on with the
[00:52] Bitcoin treasury companies, and then
[00:54] what should we think about tokenization
[00:56] and all of the things that are coming
[00:57] from the crypto world and meeting into
[00:59] that traditional financial system.
[01:01] Obviously, the future is very bright and
[01:03] people are very excited, but Bill has
[01:04] been at this for a long time. He's got
[01:06] some very unique thoughts that I think
[01:07] you guys will find very valuable. So,
[01:08] here's my latest conversation with Bill
[01:10] Barheight. All right, Bill. I thought a
[01:11] gri start the conversation is the macro
[01:13] environment once again seems to be very
[01:15] very relevant for bitcoin we obviously
[01:16] have seen tariff announcements on tariff
[01:18] announcements off back on again back off
[01:20] again threats not threats uh throughout
[01:23] all this Bitcoin went down for a while
[01:24] down to 75,000 ripped right back up um
[01:27] it feels like the world is waking up to
[01:29] could Bitcoin be the solution could
[01:31] Bitcoin be the like life raft that will
[01:33] get you out of all the chaos and
[01:34] uncertainty is that what you are
[01:35] thinking yeah I think people in the no
[01:37] kind of accept that it is and I think
[01:39] the girrations day-to-day may be
[01:42] partially news driven, but the macro
[01:45] direction meaning at if you zoom out the
[01:47] more the more out the further out you
[01:49] zoom right the the more it looks like
[01:51] it's a liquidity suck right with
[01:53] girrations hour to hour that might be
[01:56] semi- news-driven like this morning we
[01:58] had the tariff announcement uh you know
[02:00] Europe needs to move faster so blah blah
[02:02] blah right and and we saw what happened
[02:03] last time right okay yes for a while the
[02:06] sky was falling and then all of a sudden
[02:08] it it looked like it was back to the
[02:10] overlay of the liquidity, you know,
[02:12] cycles, right? And I think that's what's
[02:14] happening now. So, you know, anybody who
[02:16] basically was panicking this morning
[02:18] because Bitcoin fell three and a half%
[02:21] has not been paying attention, right?
[02:22] And and so I think we're going to see
[02:24] more of this this cycle because of the
[02:26] nature of the money printing, the
[02:29] negotiations,
[02:30] um you know, Trump feeling like he has
[02:32] to tweet every thought he has every
[02:33] minute he has them. Um and things like
[02:35] that. But but but by and large when you
[02:38] zoom out it does look like Bitcoin has
[02:41] become that overlay. Look I if if you
[02:44] accept that the the network itself has
[02:47] value, right? Just using kind of
[02:49] traditional network theory and you
[02:50] overlay and with a fixed float and you
[02:53] overlay that on top of that something
[02:55] that is constantly increasing in the
[02:57] floats. This has to happen. Yeah. 100%.
[02:59] It has to happen. And and so people, you
[03:02] know, get so afraid of of the girrations
[03:05] day-to-day that they forget the basic
[03:08] network theory, the value of a network,
[03:11] right? There is a formula to value a
[03:13] network. And when you value the network
[03:16] that's growing in terms of something
[03:19] that is being devalued, the formula
[03:21] actually acts as a lever on top of what
[03:24] you're devaluing. And people don't
[03:26] understand the math of that. And they
[03:27] where's the money coming from into
[03:28] Bitcoin? that there's money printing
[03:30] going on, but there's also other store
[03:31] value assets. And I think a lot of
[03:33] people historically thought that Bitcoin
[03:34] would surpass gold, but because gold's
[03:36] market cap would contract. People would
[03:38] basically demonetize gold, it would go
[03:39] into Bitcoin. The exact opposite has
[03:41] happened like gold is growing and
[03:42] Bitcoin is growing. So is all of the
[03:44] like net new capital, you know, flowing
[03:47] into Bitcoin, just printed money, or do
[03:49] you see it coming from other pots of
[03:51] money maybe in an investor's portfolio?
[03:52] So we talk about this a lot at AB,
[03:54] meaning where are the flows coming? We
[03:55] like to look at the flows. Smart asset
[03:57] managers look at flows. So, we we see
[03:58] three buckets and I think there's more
[04:00] that if you're more nuanced, but three
[04:02] buckets basically long-term holders like
[04:04] the OG crowd, and we love them because
[04:06] they're all borrowing against their
[04:08] Bitcoin. They don't want to sell. So,
[04:09] that's a target audience for ABRA to
[04:12] process loans against. So, so long-term
[04:14] holders. Two is kind of the new holders
[04:18] who we don't know yet if they're going
[04:19] to be long-term holders or short-term.
[04:22] And the upside and downside of the ETFs
[04:24] are kind of the same. Meaning, it's
[04:26] really easy to get into Bitcoin now
[04:28] through a traditional brokerage account
[04:29] for most brokerages, but it's equally
[04:31] easy to get out. Now, if it's in a 401k
[04:34] or an IRA, maybe, but you can still out
[04:37] reallocate within the 401k and and IRA.
[04:40] So, so that's bucket number two. And
[04:41] bucket number three is is the float left
[04:43] for traders. There's a fourth bucket,
[04:45] which is the Bitcoin that's gone
[04:46] forever. Um, but I'm leaving that aside.
[04:48] So that third bucket is actually
[04:50] shrinking over time, meaning there's
[04:52] less Bitcoin being actively traded. And
[04:56] so, you know, which leads to, okay,
[04:57] well, where is that kind of liquidity
[04:59] suck for all coins going to come from
[05:00] eventually? But but what people don't
[05:02] realize is is while it's shrinking, it's
[05:04] still a huge amount of money. Mhm.
[05:05] Right. And for the $2 trillion asset, my
[05:08] guess is is like even
[05:10] 35% of the float is still available for
[05:13] for for day-to-day trading, which is a
[05:15] lot, right? And and so, you know, that
[05:18] leaves a lot of room, right, for not
[05:20] only upside, but you know, if the demand
[05:23] is coming in from these corporations and
[05:26] and retail hasn't really even started
[05:28] yet. This is the most hated rally I've
[05:29] ever seen, right? Well, there's Google
[05:32] search volume is low, media, they're
[05:33] they're mentioning it, but it's not
[05:35] mania by any means, right? And uh it
[05:37] definitely feels like uh you can talk to
[05:39] multiple people throughout a day and if
[05:40] you're like, "Oh, Bitcoin's back at an
[05:41] all-time high." Some of them know, but a
[05:43] lot of them don't. Historically, the two
[05:45] ways that we were able to determine
[05:46] whether this rally was retail loved or
[05:48] hated was perpetual future leverage and
[05:51] and it used to be the premium on the on
[05:53] the grayscale stuff and now it's kind of
[05:54] the premium on micro strategy. But the
[05:56] the the perpetual future uh leverage
[05:59] ratios are at all-time lows relative to
[06:01] where we are in the rally. Meaning
[06:03] meaning if retail was on board, the
[06:05] amount of leverage in the system would
[06:06] be much higher than it is now. Right?
[06:08] And so what that tells me is is that
[06:10] there's a lot of room to the upside and
[06:12] the downside swings shouldn't be as much
[06:14] as they were in the past specific to
[06:15] Bitcoin. I mean now uh you mentioned the
[06:18] Bitcoin treasury company strategy,
[06:19] there's Metapanet, there's many of these
[06:21] things. Um it feels like uh on one hand
[06:24] this is the Hail Mary that gets caught
[06:26] every time, right? You put Bitcoin on
[06:27] your balance sheet, your stock goes up,
[06:29] everything's amazing. Um but there's
[06:31] also risk and there's leverage being
[06:34] used. Uh there are these premiums. you
[06:36] know, some people say, "Hey, look,
[06:38] there's this NAV premium doesn't make
[06:39] sense. It's going to collapse." Other
[06:41] people say, "No, that's like, you know,
[06:42] future cash flow multiples or, you know,
[06:44] however you want to think about it." How
[06:46] do you evaluate when these things come
[06:48] out, whether you or Abra like should we
[06:50] buy, should we not, is this something we
[06:52] should support or or or not. Um, in
[06:54] terms of both the positives and the
[06:56] negatives. Yeah, I think the the vast
[06:57] majority of the public should be holding
[06:59] the underlying. Just buy Bitcoin. If you
[07:01] want to have a small altcoin allocation,
[07:02] Salana, whatever, that's fine. But just
[07:04] buy Bitcoin. Even Sailor to his credit,
[07:06] I don't know if he just feels compelled
[07:07] to tell people that he really believes
[07:08] it, but but look, people who um have to
[07:11] buy equities or or for whatever reason
[07:14] want a levered bet that's equity based
[07:16] will buy Micro Strategy, right? It is a
[07:18] levered bet. So, so the downside on this
[07:20] is that and it would be easier if I had
[07:22] a piece of paper in front of me, but but
[07:23] think about the amount of leverage
[07:25] that's being used. the formula works
[07:28] well if the amount of leverage right
[07:31] that's being used is less than the
[07:33] devaluation of the dollar that's being
[07:36] absorbed but that's not the case right
[07:37] now meaning they're leveraging
[07:39] themselves collectively as a as a
[07:41] corporate treasury let's take all the
[07:43] companies in the aggregate that are
[07:45] trying to buy Bitcoin right now and
[07:47] overlay the amount of leverage that
[07:48] they're taking at shareholder expense
[07:50] that leverage is higher than the rate of
[07:54] devaluation% of the dollar I think that
[07:56] on the low end you have kind of like mid
[07:57] single digit leverage and then on the
[07:59] high end you've got like I think 27 25%
[08:01] something like that. Yeah. So so that's
[08:03] that that sounds right. And so by
[08:05] definition right there's huge risk there
[08:07] because if the dollar devaluation slows
[08:11] and you start to get it to a position
[08:13] where um you know that that what they
[08:15] call that MNAV is not uh growing, you're
[08:18] going to have an unwind problem. So you
[08:20] can unwind these positions exactly the
[08:22] same way you wound them in in the first
[08:24] place, right? And if that happens, you
[08:26] could see a precipitous fall in in in
[08:28] the price of Bitcoin while the market
[08:30] catches up to that. I don't think it
[08:32] would just crash Bitcoin, but it would
[08:34] certainly fall, you know, you could see
[08:35] a 15 20% 25% drop in the price
[08:38] relatively quickly if if for some reason
[08:41] if if if we had massive austerity
[08:43] measures, right? The first stocks that
[08:46] would get hit in my opinion are the
[08:48] Bitcoin stocks, right? And and it's not
[08:50] because Bitcoin becomes worth that much
[08:53] less instantly. It's because of their
[08:55] leverage versus the valuation perception
[08:58] of the dollar in the midterm. Well, I
[09:00] guess also if uh you know a good
[09:02] exercise is like let's say that strategy
[09:03] or metaplan or whoever came out and said
[09:04] we're done buying bitcoin then I think
[09:07] that the premiums do collapse 100% on
[09:09] day one. It it doesn't mean that they go
[09:11] negative and it's a discount to nav. It
[09:12] just means they probably go closer to
[09:14] nav. Those premiums are forward-looking
[09:15] expectations on leverage. And if there's
[09:17] no incremental leverage coming into the
[09:18] system, those premiums should look like
[09:20] an ETF. The only reason they don't is
[09:22] because they believe they're going to
[09:23] get diluted with more shares with the
[09:25] value of Bitcoin growing faster than the
[09:28] amount of dilution, which is the
[09:29] perpetual motion machine that everybody
[09:31] perceives that Sailor has figured out.
[09:33] If you're a shareholder, then the uh NAV
[09:36] premium collapse back to NAV could mean
[09:38] a lower share price, right? So there
[09:40] there's a potential loss there. But for
[09:42] the company, that doesn't mean that you
[09:43] have to sell your Bitcoin. No. Right.
[09:44] That just means, hey, look, now we just
[09:45] traded NAV and we still own a bunch of
[09:47] Bitcoin, whatever. Is there a scenario
[09:49] where something can happen and they've
[09:51] got to kind of puke back out all the
[09:53] bitcoin that they've been buying in your
[09:55] opinion?
[09:56] Like I guess if I are demanding a
[09:58] payment of converts that aren't
[10:00] converting to No, I think I think my
[10:02] understanding because I'm not an expert
[10:03] on what sellers set up. My understanding
[10:05] is is that I don't see a scenario under
[10:08] which he would have to sell all the
[10:10] Bitcoin. if there was a rapid pullback,
[10:13] he might have to sell some to deal with
[10:15] the fact that the current note holders
[10:18] are underwater and they can't they're
[10:20] not going to convert, right? So that
[10:21] amount of Bitcoin would have to be sold.
[10:23] Now, if it went to zero quickly, he's
[10:25] screwed. But we're all screwed at that
[10:26] point, right? So So I think it would
[10:28] fall it would create a cycle where it
[10:30] would fall, you know, to create maximum
[10:32] pain and then recover, but a small
[10:35] amount of Bitcoin would probably have to
[10:36] be sold in the very worst case scenario.
[10:38] Now, some of the others have a lot more
[10:41] leverage. I could see those stocks going
[10:43] to zero or crashing or creating big
[10:46] problems with shareholders and then
[10:47] having shareholder lawsuits, etc., etc.,
[10:49] because I don't think I think you can
[10:51] make the case that the shareholders
[10:53] don't understand the amount of inherent
[10:55] leverage in the systems that they're
[10:56] investing in. And by the way, I'm not
[10:58] saying that these are all bad things to
[10:59] be doing. I think it's it's actually
[11:01] kind of interesting that we're we're
[11:02] using money to test these things,
[11:04] especially if it's not my money. But but
[11:06] at the end of the day, you know, there
[11:08] is a risk that these things don't work.
[11:09] The big bet here, again, I'll say it
[11:11] again, is is that the United States
[11:13] continues to devalue the dollar at rate
[11:15] X and if the amount of leverage or rate
[11:18] Y is slightly higher than X, this can
[11:20] actually work, you know, with with some
[11:23] volatility for quite a while. If Y gets
[11:25] too high, meaning that amount of
[11:26] leverage gets too high versus the rate
[11:28] of devaluation of the dollar and new
[11:30] money stops coming in because there's
[11:32] other places to put the money, right,
[11:34] that's a big problem. M when you think
[11:37] about areas outside of Bitcoin, there's
[11:39] stable coins, there's tokenization that
[11:41] all the big banks are talking about. Um
[11:43] what are the areas that you see that are
[11:45] one exciting to you and to Abra, but
[11:47] also uh you think are legit going to
[11:49] happen, right? Cuz people are promising
[11:51] the world. Uh but are there certain
[11:53] areas where you're like, "All right,
[11:54] these are the main things right now that
[11:55] we're focused on or paying attention."
[11:57] Yeah, I'll open the kimono for you.
[11:58] We're very clear on this at Abra. I
[11:59] mean, so so are you looking for a simple

[13:02] The fastest growing business at Abra is
[13:04] people opening up their uh RAIA
[13:07] accounts, their registered investment
[13:08] advisor accounts, putting Bitcoin in the
[13:10] vault, and then borrowing against the
[13:11] value of that Bitcoin. Interesting. So,
[13:13] that's that's our fastest growing
[13:14] business today. And that kind of makes
[13:15] sense because as Bitcoin becomes a $2
[13:17] trillion asset, remember I said there's
[13:19] three buckets. Those OGs have a lot of
[13:21] Bitcoin. Why don't they want to sell?
[13:22] Well, two big reasons. One, I think the
[13:24] price is going to go forever given what
[13:26] we just discussed. And and two, I don't
[13:28] want to pay taxes, right? So, we have a
[13:29] great solution for that. And we
[13:31] basically use DeFi marketplaces. So our
[13:33] rates are like 5 6% right now. Whereas
[13:37] centralized lenders who are artificially
[13:39] you know have a cost of capital in the
[13:41] 10 11% range are charging 15% for the
[13:43] same loans. Now where do we go from
[13:45] here? My t my take is is that the DeFi
[13:48] networks that we use to process those
[13:51] loans in the background. So our clients
[13:53] don't see this right? They can ask we
[13:55] explain it. It's all in our risk
[13:56] disclosures. But but the model that
[13:58] we've come up with is there's an open
[14:00] marketplace. Yield on one side, mostly
[14:03] dollar yield, right? Collateralized
[14:05] loans on the other side, right? Why is
[14:08] that relegated to Bitcoin right now?
[14:09] Well, Bitcoin is the native asset that
[14:12] is worth enough money to warrant those
[14:14] loans. But there are assets out there
[14:16] that you can easily pump into DeFi
[14:18] networks if you do the tokenization
[14:20] correctly that now have a bid and an ask
[14:23] which is all you need to facilitate the
[14:26] loan because you need to be able to
[14:27] liquidate if they don't make the
[14:28] payment. Yep. Right. And that's what
[14:30] DeFi does for you. It basically gives
[14:31] you that 24/7 liquidation. So that opens
[14:34] up the true value in my opinion of
[14:37] tokenization which is that not only do
[14:39] you have access we don't really have a
[14:41] big access problem in the US but with
[14:43] with 10 billion people you do access
[14:45] meaning I can buy and sell but I also am
[14:48] liquid in terms of being able to have
[14:50] secondary markets via DeFi that I can
[14:53] borrow against the value of these assets
[14:55] for. So our belief and vision at Abra is
[14:59] is that you're going to have ultimate
[15:00] fungeability of anything and everything.
[15:02] So whether it's stocks, traditional
[15:04] stocks, uh right funds, read funds, um
[15:08] metals, um other types of you know hard
[15:10] to access private equity venture, uh
[15:13] higher risk stuff, prediction markets,
[15:16] um are all going to be fungeible and
[15:18] you're going to be able to borrow
[15:19] against the value of those assets using
[15:22] models like ours. Mhm. Right. that are
[15:25] actually relatively low risk because
[15:27] what we're saying to clients is borrow
[15:29] 30% of the value of that asset. Is there
[15:32] a chance that the value of the asset
[15:33] falls 90%. That's always going to be
[15:35] yes% right. But if you're smart about
[15:39] the historical value of the underlying
[15:40] asset that you're borrowing against,
[15:42] there are ways to do this. People do it
[15:44] all the time with helocks, right? That's
[15:46] the most well understood secondary
[15:49] lending market right for borrowing
[15:52] against the value of a fixed asset is is
[15:54] is heliloc loans in the United States
[15:56] and there are similar models in Europe
[15:57] etc etc we're simply saying create a
[16:01] standardized fungeible model to do this
[16:04] for everything that's the big vision at
[16:07] Abber longterm yeah it's uh um obviously
[16:10] finance is going in this direction and
[16:12] the question I think is um one how much
[16:14] of uh the market is Bitcoin going to eat
[16:16] from a capital, you know, kind of suck
[16:18] standpoint, but also two, uh, it maybe,
[16:21] I don't know, uh, 5 years ago was 100%
[16:23] centralized in the traditional financial
[16:24] world, 0% decentralized. Um, 20 years
[16:28] from now, it's not 100 and zero. It's
[16:31] some mix between central and
[16:32] decentralized. And I think that that's
[16:34] an open question as to like where do we
[16:35] end up? Is it 50/50? Is it, you know, in
[16:38] favor of decentralization or
[16:39] centralization? Um, and then you're
[16:41] probably never going to get the full
[16:42] stack to be decentralized because you're
[16:44] still going to have centralized
[16:45] companies or centralized, you know,
[16:46] investors or centralized whatever, but
[16:48] you'll get maybe pieces of
[16:49] infrastructure, maybe it's markets or or
[16:51] whatever that as that decentralization
[16:53] comes in, uh, there's a lot of benefits,
[16:55] right? And I actually think if you have
[16:56] more confidence in the decentralization,
[16:59] then obviously you should get more
[17:00] capital come to the market. It's like a
[17:01] net positive for the whole thing, right?
[17:02] That's right. Yeah. And I'm also I would
[17:04] say, you know, 25 years out I'm probably
[17:07] bearish on the traditional asset
[17:08] management model because I feel like the
[17:11] whole idea of securitization is going to
[17:13] change because right now Black Rockck's
[17:15] ownership model is based upon the idea
[17:17] of incorporation and the joint stock
[17:19] company. I actually think that that
[17:20] model doesn't make sense. When you
[17:22] extrapolate 20 years out in the world of
[17:24] AI and Dows and robots and autonomous
[17:28] organizations, I actually think cars are
[17:30] going to own themselves and you'll have
[17:31] eight robotic, you know, AI agents that
[17:33] run themselves. And so again, 25 years
[17:36] out, the model of asset management is
[17:39] going to be flipped on its head and and
[17:41] I and I think that the incumbents, many
[17:43] of them are not going to survive that
[17:45] model. So this what I'm describing
[17:46] actually is is is what I often describe
[17:48] as kind of a postforth turning bank.
[17:50] What does a postforth turning bank look
[17:52] like? Well, it's going to be based upon
[17:55] decentralized rails, operate 24/7,
[17:58] always on, no borders, right? Are fun,
[18:01] create fungeibility across asset types,
[18:03] deal with this new concept that's coming
[18:05] of Dows instead of companies as well as
[18:08] the historical companies and crypto, but
[18:10] all in one kind of big, you know, soup
[18:12] of a financial system, which most banks
[18:15] wouldn't even understand what I just
[18:16] said, never mind be ready for. Yep. you
[18:18] know when um when you look at that uh
[18:21] posturing
[18:23] uh type bank um
[18:27] where are the areas of opportunity
[18:28] obviously you're building a company that
[18:29] is tangentially related there right so
[18:31] like where do you guys see opportunities
[18:32] for yourself but also uh where do you
[18:34] think maybe is the biggest exposure of
[18:36] risk to the legacy guys that it's like
[18:38] the last place that they'll go to be
[18:39] able to compete with kind of the
[18:41] upstarts yeah those are the right
[18:42] questions and we get a lot of inbounds
[18:43] now post Trump administration coming in
[18:45] from midsize banks that are asking these
[18:48] questions. How do we get into crypto
[18:50] now? Should we just offer Bitcoin to our
[18:52] clients? Should we offer lending? What
[18:54] should we be doing? So, so from our
[18:57] perspective for us as an as a you know
[18:59] relative upstart relative to banks and
[19:01] which is most crypto companies, I think
[19:03] the opportunity for us is to be the best
[19:06] possible cryptonnative bank that we can
[19:08] be for our clients. That means holding
[19:10] crypto assets, facilitating loans
[19:13] against crypto assets, preparing for the
[19:15] oncoming tokenization which represents
[19:17] holding stocks as tokens, real estate as
[19:20] tokens, other investments as tokens
[19:22] which are now liquid. So my bank account
[19:24] will be basically a revolving credit
[19:26] account against the value of those
[19:28] assets that I can spend in real time,
[19:31] right? Draw down on. And if I'm
[19:33] borrowing smartly against the assets
[19:35] that are appreciating quickly, I might
[19:37] not even be paying back my loans if I'm
[19:39] borrowing in the dollar, which is a
[19:40] perpetually depreciating asset, which I
[19:43] think long term is the demise of the
[19:45] dollar because that system is not viable
[19:47] in perpetuity. Meaning meaning you can't
[19:49] have a perpetual motion machine which
[19:50] allows you to borrow forever against the
[19:53] depreciating asset. It just breaks down
[19:55] at some point. But at least I I would
[19:56] guess for the next 20 years that's going
[19:59] to work. And then, you know, we'll
[20:01] probably figure out how to spend in in
[20:03] the native appreciating asset, which
[20:05] would be Bitcoin and and, you know,
[20:06] potentially other other tokens. But but
[20:09] for now, right, we're building that
[20:11] crypto bank that allows you to buy,
[20:15] store, hold, borrow, earn, yield. If I'm
[20:18] a bank, I'm saying to myself, okay,
[20:21] right, this business is growing much
[20:23] faster than ours. I said five years ago
[20:26] people asked me, you know, do you think
[20:27] we'll get to the point where the banks
[20:29] are buying the exchanges? I said
[20:30] absolutely not. We're going to get to
[20:31] the point where the exchanges are buying
[20:32] banks because because who's growing
[20:35] faster? This is common sense, right? So
[20:37] I believe in this cycle the top five
[20:39] exchanges will be competing with each
[20:40] other to figure out which banks to buy
[20:42] to get in in the door to figure out how
[20:44] to offer the the plethora of services
[20:46] that they want to offer and and
[20:47] brokerages as well, right? And and and
[20:49] that prepares them for this tokenization
[20:51] of everything which creates the
[20:52] fungeability model. and then we kind of
[20:54] all back into competing with each other
[20:56] in some way with similar services. I
[20:58] think the traditional exchange model
[21:00] morphs into something which is less
[21:02] trader focused and more investor focused
[21:04] which is a problem for them longer term
[21:06] because their fe fees are going to be
[21:07] compressed because you know that's why
[21:09] you're going to see all these models
[21:10] where you know you have monthly uh
[21:12] subscription fees instead of trading
[21:14] fees because they know what's coming
[21:15] right when um when you think about the
[21:17] change in regulation that has occurred
[21:19] that you're mentioning um what have been
[21:21] the biggest positive impacts on Aubra
[21:23] and then what are the things that are
[21:24] still roadblocks or obstacles that need
[21:26] to be changed? Well, the the the biggest
[21:28] uh benefit has been there's, you know, I
[21:30] don't have crazy people chasing me with
[21:31] flaming baseball bats trying to kill me
[21:33] all day. Uh and and and so that sounds
[21:36] good. Yeah, it sounds really good,
[21:37] right? I mean, it's like the little
[21:38] things, you know? So, um today's episode
[21:41] is sponsored by Figure Markets, the
[21:43] place you go to earn yield and borrow

[22:34] with Figure. Go to
[22:37] figure.com/p. And and and not even for
[22:39] doing anything, you know, wrong. I mean,
[22:41] like like we were um like one of the few
[22:45] companies out there that did went
[22:47] overboard to disclose when we had
[22:50] losses, you know, with Genesis and
[22:51] others. We I tweeted about it. So So
[22:54] that that hurt, you know, and not having
[22:56] that anymore has been awesome, right?
[23:00] And we're just as committed as we were
[23:01] then to following the rules. And we've
[23:04] always said, be very clear with us with
[23:06] what the rules are and and we'll follow
[23:08] the rules. Even if I don't like the
[23:10] rules, it doesn't my personal opinion on
[23:12] the rules, I'll come on here,
[23:13] pontificate, but ultimately doesn't
[23:14] matter, right? Because I'm going to
[23:16] follow the rules either way or I'll get
[23:17] out of business. Yep. Right. So that's
[23:19] number one. And I would say number two
[23:21] is we need a a a model in in crypto that
[23:25] allows upstarts to get in without a
[23:29] baseline level of regulatory spend
[23:32] that's untenable. And so I'm hearing
[23:34] rumblings of this kind of sandbox model
[23:36] between like in in the US the CFTC and
[23:39] the SEC and maybe it'll become a basis
[23:41] for other markets as well. ours is a
[23:43] little more complicated, so maybe they
[23:44] don't need it as much. But this idea
[23:46] that you can operate in a model where
[23:48] especially for upstart defi type systems
[23:50] where you may not be decentralized yet,
[23:53] but you don't want to basically deal
[23:54] with all the complexities of securities,
[23:56] laws, and dividends and issuance and all
[23:58] this stuff. And so maybe you have a path
[24:00] to get there that is tenable in terms of
[24:03] filings and cost, etc., etc. So, so and
[24:06] and we need clear rules of of the road
[24:09] for that. I'm actually more concerned
[24:11] about that than I am about stable coin
[24:13] legislation. I'm I'm a little concerned
[24:15] about some of the nuances of the current
[24:16] stable coin st uh regulation, but I
[24:19] don't think it's going to matter that
[24:20] much. Stable coins exist today. They're
[24:22] going to exist next week after the the
[24:24] the legislation is signed and the world
[24:25] will go on. What about the banks?
[24:27] They're supposedly trying to all come
[24:28] together a little uh that will happen.
[24:30] Uh little I don't know, maybe mafia is a
[24:32] bad terminology. A little group uh and
[24:35] create a stable coin together. Is that
[24:36] like a little Rico Rico by any other
[24:38] name? So, so I'm hearing rumblings that
[24:40] we are going to get a stable coin from
[24:41] kind of the zel kuritsu and I they
[24:43] should um if I was them that's what I'd
[24:46] be doing. Um I think the government will
[24:48] support it. I think the problem that I
[24:50] have with the current legislation is is
[24:52] they'll be able to pay yield on the
[24:54] stable coin they create whereas
[24:56] everybody else who's not a bank won't,
[24:58] right? And I think that's an unfair
[25:00] practice. Now you can create a money
[25:02] market token and pay yield on that. The
[25:05] problem is if that's deemed a security,
[25:06] you're probably offering it outside the
[25:08] US. So, so you kind of back into some
[25:10] some problems where you inadvertently
[25:12] create regulatory capture opportunities
[25:14] for for the banks. And I don't think it
[25:16] was in it was was inadvertent. I think
[25:18] that was a very conscious uh ploy on
[25:20] their part to basically say, okay, this
[25:22] is our opportunity to potentially own
[25:24] this in the US and let everybody, you
[25:26] know, fight it out in in other markets.
[25:29] So, yeah. Yeah. Do you think that it's a
[25:31] it's a problem that uh um they would be
[25:35] able to do it? Not really. I mean, look,
[25:37] it's still a dollar at the end of the
[25:38] day, right? Most consumers don't care,
[25:40] right? A dollar is a dollar is a dollar.
[25:42] Um and they don't understand the nuance
[25:44] of where the treasuries and short-term
[25:46] securities are being held. The average
[25:47] person who uses USDC is probably
[25:49] completely unaware of what happened in,
[25:51] you know, March of when was it 24 when
[25:54] when, you know, the banks went south. It
[25:56] seems like an eternity ago now, but but
[25:58] um it's it's it's I would like to see
[26:00] more competition. That's always my
[26:03] fallback position. You want to do what's
[26:05] right by the consumer, enable lots of
[26:07] competition, and eventually, right, the
[26:09] the the cream will float to the top.
[26:11] I've always believed that. Um regulatory
[26:14] capture is the opposite of that. So
[26:17] that's I always like that's my kind of
[26:19] guiding light when it or northstar when
[26:21] it comes to regulation. Traditionally,
[26:24] uh, less is good, right? Here, I would
[26:27] say I think there's a provision that
[26:29] allows for smaller companies to not have
[26:31] to be OC chartered and allows for money
[26:34] transmission and everything else to
[26:36] enable um, you know, basic stable coins
[26:38] and that's a good thing. Um, and you
[26:41] know, again, we're just talking about
[26:42] the dollar. My other concern, which I
[26:44] think they've addressed, is is that,
[26:45] okay, in traditional money markets, you
[26:48] can or wire, you know, banks, you can
[26:49] receive euros from another bank and
[26:52] convert those to dollars. Those euros
[26:53] weren't created in the US. The original
[26:55] version of the legislation didn't allow
[26:58] for non USissued stable coins, which
[27:00] makes no sense because you've now taken
[27:02] away the ability to send euros and have
[27:05] those euros converted to dollars. I
[27:06] think they've addressed that, which
[27:08] benefits the likes of Tether and, you
[27:10] know, other non- US issuers. What do you
[27:12] think is the single biggest development
[27:15] that could happen this year that is
[27:17] positive for Bitcoin? Biggest single
[27:19] development this year? Like is there one
[27:22] last, you know, hurdle for us to jump
[27:24] over? I I think Bitcoin is fine. You
[27:26] know, I don't think so. I I think
[27:28] Bitcoin doesn't care about corporate,
[27:30] you know, adoption. Uh I think retail is
[27:33] more important to Bitcoin long term than
[27:35] corporate adoption. I'm fine with it.
[27:37] You know, my company's holding Bitcoin.
[27:39] We're going to continue to put profits
[27:40] into into Bitcoin. But I think I think
[27:42] it's it's the the the getting the public
[27:46] to understand that the government is
[27:48] like not anti or pro Bitcoin. and it
[27:51] just is would be a big win because I do
[27:53] think there's this perception that the
[27:55] government was trying to kill crypto and
[27:57] I don't think that that has really um
[28:00] the reality of where we are now has
[28:02] caught up with the public yet, right?
[28:04] There's definitely a red and blue uh
[28:07] issue with crypto right now because of
[28:09] how everything went down in the last
[28:11] election and we need that to go away,
[28:13] right? You know, there's a there's this
[28:15] kind of liberal perception in some
[28:17] circles right now that that crypto is
[28:19] bad. it's a grift, etc., etc., and and
[28:21] and Bitcoin is obviously associated with
[28:23] that by proxy. And I would like for that
[28:25] to go away, but that's a people issue.
[28:27] It's not a Bitcoin issue, right? And so,
[28:29] Bitcoin is working just fine. I you
[28:31] know, there are some technology issues
[28:33] with Bitcoin that I'm concerned about
[28:34] that need to be addressed, but I I I
[28:36] think that uh the atomic nature of
[28:38] Bitcoin is working just fine and will
[28:40] continue to work just fine in the
[28:41] meantime. Yeah, I um I completely agree.
[28:43] What's the like 60-cond pitch on why
[28:45] someone should use ZRA? Yeah. So, we
[28:47] are, I think, the ultimate place for
[28:49] high netw worth investors, upper middle
[28:52] class, family office investors to hold
[28:54] crypto, hold their Bitcoin. Uh, it's
[28:56] bankruptcy remote, so you're getting a
[28:58] personal vault, right? That if Abra goes
[29:00] away is still yours. You're able to
[29:02] borrow against the value of crypto at
[29:04] low rates. You're able to earn yield on
[29:06] dollars, Bitcoin, stakeable assets,
[29:08] etc., etc. And I haven't seen any place
[29:10] that soup to nuts has figured out how to
[29:13] offer that simple uh range of services
[29:15] to the average investor. I feel like uh
[29:18] people are very interested in borrowing
[29:20] against earning yield like all the all
[29:22] the financial services that are
[29:24] available to them in the traditional
[29:25] world they want in this world. Right.
[29:26] Yeah. Exactly. Amazing. Well, thank you
[29:27] so much for taking the time to do this
[29:28] and we'll do it again in the future. My
[29:29] pleasure, Mig. can see it.
