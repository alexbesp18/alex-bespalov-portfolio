[00:02] Gemini. Uh, don't put me next to those
[00:04] two guys.
[00:06] Jeez. Gemini. Uh, they're like 66 and
[00:10] they're
[00:11] like
[00:13] billionaires. Shut. Uh, crypto exchange.
[00:16] No. Crypto exchange funded by Cameron
[00:18] and Tyler Wlvoss has filed
[00:21] confidentially for an IPO. Put me next
[00:22] to pump for an No, I'm kidding. For an
[00:24] IPO in the US. A press release on Friday
[00:27] said listing is expected to occur after
[00:30] the SEC completes its review process
[00:32] subject to market conditions. The news
[00:35] follows a blockbuster debut. Debut the
[00:39] butt. Bob U for stablecoin issue circle
[00:42] last week. That stock soared in its
[00:44] first two days of trading. It's up again
[00:46] today in the pre-market. Pomp is here.
[00:49] Here to talk Bitcoin and other crypto
[00:51] assets is Anthony Pompiano. Uh he is
[00:54] founder and CEO of Professional Capital
[00:55] Management. Did you know Circle was
[00:57] going to do this? Um I did not expect
[01:00] Circle to do this, but uh before we talk
[01:01] about that, you're the best looking of
[01:02] the three up there, so don't worry about
[01:04] it. And of course, it's really the best
[01:06] looking of the two since they look
[01:08] basically the same. Look, I I think with
[01:11] circle um you know there's a really big
[01:13] uh kind of shift on Wall Street which is
[01:16] uh they are looking to figure out
[01:17] where's the intersection of
[01:18] cryptocurrencies and traditional finance
[01:20] and obviously stable coins I think is
[01:22] one area where they've said hey not only
[01:23] is this something that uh the market
[01:25] wants in terms of the free market of
[01:26] users on the internet but it's also
[01:28] something that we can benefit from
[01:29] ourselves as well and you hear many of
[01:31] the large banks and financial
[01:32] institutions talking about using stable
[01:34] coins themselves so it's something that
[01:36] is touching on crypto but something that
[01:37] they understand and they can use
[01:39] themselves and so I think maybe a word
[01:40] of caution is that every crypto company
[01:42] that now tries to go public may not get
[01:44] the same welcome. It may be more of a
[01:46] stable coin story than it is a crypto
[01:48] story. But then there's companies like,
[01:49] you know, Gemini, which are great
[01:51] businesses and seem to have done really
[01:53] well over the years. Um, and so it's
[01:54] really just going to come down to not
[01:55] are you a crypto company or are you not,
[01:57] are you a good business or not? So tell
[01:59] us about Gemini's business. Well, I
[02:01] think with Gemini, one of the things
[02:02] that they've always said is look, they
[02:03] want to be a regulated US financial
[02:05] institution, right? And so they've run
[02:06] ad campaigns all across the country
[02:08] doing that. They've really, I think,
[02:10] listened to the users and said not only
[02:11] uh they want to have the right
[02:12] interfaces, they've come out with this
[02:14] uh uh uh crypto credit card that uh
[02:17] gives crypto rewards back to users. Very
[02:19] popular product. And so I think that
[02:20] what you're starting to see here is a
[02:22] meeting of traditional finance and
[02:24] crypto, right? If you look at exchanges,
[02:26] Robin Hood is a traditional brokerage
[02:28] exchange. A very fast growing segment of
[02:29] that is crypto. If you look at Kraken,
[02:31] Kraken is a crypto exchange that's
[02:33] trying to add US equities. And I think
[02:34] companies like uh Gemini are saying to
[02:36] themselves, well, what other financial
[02:38] services can we offer to our user base?
[02:39] And this credit card that they came out
[02:41] with uh is a good example. And I think
[02:42] you'll see all of these exchanges
[02:44] continue to do this in the future. The
[02:46] Robin Hood markets really built up last
[02:48] week on the expectation of going to the
[02:50] S&P 500. It was down more than I think
[02:52] it was down more than 5% earlier. Now
[02:54] it's off by about 3.3%. Weird moves like
[02:57] that don't phase you much. I guess
[02:59] coming from uh the Bitcoin world, a 3%
[03:01] move is uh you know, just part for the
[03:03] course. Yeah, but but look, I do think
[03:05] that we have an entire generation of
[03:06] investors. I I call them either
[03:08] self-directed investors or independent
[03:10] investors. Uh retail it now owns
[03:12] something like 36 or 38% of US uh stock
[03:15] in the market. It's the highest
[03:17] percentage they've ever owned. Uh these
[03:19] people are used to volatility and a lot
[03:21] of it comes from the Bitcoin and
[03:22] cryptocurrency world. But now you're
[03:24] starting to see volatility trickle into
[03:25] the US stock market as well. And
[03:27] obviously things like tariffs on,
[03:28] tariffs off and other kind of
[03:30] geopolitical events are leading to that
[03:32] volatility. But what you're seeing is
[03:33] that retail has convinced themselves
[03:35] they are just going to buy the dip. And
[03:36] as they continue to see markets go down,
[03:38] they buy the dip and then we get these
[03:40] recoveries. And I think that's why you
[03:41] see institutions sitting on the
[03:42] sidelines and not having as much
[03:43] exposure to US equities as maybe retail
[03:46] has had this year. So kind of a babe in
[03:49] the woods on uh we all are obviously
[03:52] it's such a new technology, but so
[03:54] stable coins, let's say you get a stable
[03:55] coin backed by treasuries that that you
[03:58] tra what you use the ether backbone or
[04:01] something. Doesn't that make the case to
[04:05] use Bitcoin as a transactional
[04:08] uh utility for that? Doesn't it take
[04:12] that away to some extent? And and then
[04:15] you've got Bitcoin just stuck with a
[04:16] store of value uh or or a gold analog
[04:20] rather than actually being what you use,
[04:23] you know, for transactions across the
[04:25] globe. Does it make it less attractive?
[04:27] Well, I think it's a great question
[04:28] because really, well, yeah, because
[04:30] Bitcoin I think there's three things
[04:31] that people want Bitcoin to be. They
[04:32] want to be a store of value, a medium of
[04:34] exchange, and a unit of account. See
[04:35] things priced in Bitcoin eventually. Uh,
[04:37] in order to get there, what we are
[04:38] seeing is that Bitcoin is succeeding and
[04:40] the US dollar is succeeding. They're
[04:42] both strengthening together, and it is
[04:43] the weak fiat currencies that are kind
[04:45] of falling at the feet of those two.
[04:47] Now, one of the things that stable coins
[04:48] have brought to the market is there's a
[04:50] lot of people around the world that say,
[04:51] I would like to use Bitcoin as a savings
[04:54] account. I call it a digital savings
[04:55] account. I would like to spend something
[04:57] that is not going to be worth more in
[04:59] the future. And so I'll use the digital
[05:00] dollar and these uh dollar stable coins.
[05:02] And so if you think about today, the
[05:05] average finance user, they have a
[05:06] savings account, they have a checking
[05:08] account, and they have a brokerage
[05:10] account. That's what we're basically
[05:11] seeing recreated in the digital world.
[05:12] You're saving in Bitcoin, you're
[05:14] spending in stable coins, and then you
[05:15] are going and you're speculating on
[05:17] whatever assets you want your portfolio.
[05:19] What I think the big question becomes,
[05:20] and I don't have the answer, I don't
[05:22] think anyone does yet, is as we continue
[05:24] to see the destruction of the purchasing
[05:26] power of the US dollar, are we going to
[05:28] see people start to price things in
[05:30] Bitcoin? Now, I don't think that's
[05:31] something that's going to happen in 1,
[05:32] three, maybe even 5 years. But I do
[05:34] think that there is a growing group of
[05:36] people who say, look, this thing called
[05:38] Bitcoin is ultimately going to be a
[05:40] store of value uh as it already is. But
[05:42] it will become a medium of exchange as
[05:44] well. It just needs to get to a point
[05:46] where the world all agrees on what is it
[05:47] worth. And if you think in 2018 the
[05:50] world thought it was worth $3,000 a
[05:52] coin. Today the world thinks it's worth
[05:53] $105,000 a coin. It's going to continue
[05:56] to go higher and at some point it will
[05:57] reach some market equilibrium and then
[05:59] when you see that switch over into okay
[06:01] now things are priced in Bitcoin. I
[06:03] think that's kind of the hyper
[06:03] bitcoinization that the bitcoiners are
[06:05] waiting for. But there is a long path to
[06:07] get there and the sequence right now is
[06:09] why would I want to spend my bitcoin if
[06:11] it's going to be worth more in the
[06:12] future. Right? I want to spend the
[06:14] dollars that are going to be worth less
[06:15] in the future. How many stable coins
[06:17] based on the dollar do we need? And is
[06:19] Ether the best blockchain network to to
[06:24] be carried on? Is there a can it be
[06:26] carried on a Bitcoin blockchain? See,
[06:28] I'm telling you, I'm a bit in the woods.
[06:29] Look, there there's a number of
[06:31] different stable coins that have
[06:32] different kind of twists to them. So, if
[06:33] you look at uh Tether, for example,
[06:35] Tether has really said what we want to
[06:36] do is we want to take the US dollar,
[06:37] which is one of the best product market
[06:39] fit products ever created in human
[06:41] history, and we want to bring it to
[06:42] people in the emerging world. They have
[06:43] something like over 400 million users. I
[06:45] think they're gaining 30 million users
[06:47] per quarter. Just crazy numbers. $13
[06:49] billion in profit, over $85 million in
[06:52] profit per employee. Amazing business.
[06:54] Circle has said, "Well, let's go and
[06:56] actually be the US regulated financial
[06:58] institution and try to go get
[06:59] distribution through exchanges like
[07:00] Coinbase and others. So, both of them
[07:02] are attacking a market from two
[07:03] different ends." And I think that both
[07:05] will end up having a business. Um but
[07:07] then you also get a number of stable
[07:08] coins that say well what if we take the
[07:10] interest that we're earning from the
[07:11] treasuries that we're holding and we
[07:12] start to return that back to some of the
[07:14] holders. You get all these different
[07:16] twists and we'll see what ends up
[07:17] happening. How how important is auditing
[07:19] in all of this because you know a while
[07:22] ago this is back in 2016 2018 there were
[07:25] concerns about Tether. The I think it
[07:27] was the CFTC or somebody had said that
[07:28] it was only backed like they still
[07:30] didn't give us a great answer last week.
[07:31] Yeah. What what's the reality of the
[07:34] audit? I I I know that Michael Sailor
[07:36] has said there are concerns about some
[07:38] of these full outright audits, but how
[07:40] how does an investor feel confident with
[07:42] I think there's three things that are
[07:43] really important. The first thing is I
[07:44] would not want to compete against
[07:45] Tether. Tether has a massive balance
[07:47] sheet. They have been excellent at
[07:48] executing and they have a fantastic
[07:50] business. The second thing is that there
[07:51] was a bunch of this FUD around, hey, do
[07:53] they have the money that they say they
[07:54] have? Right. Because they're supposed to
[07:55] be backed one for one by US dollar for
[07:57] everything. There was a watershed moment
[07:58] when Howard Lutnik when he was at cancer
[08:00] fisherald came out and he said I know
[08:02] that they have it because I've seen it
[08:04] and there's an entire story which at one
[08:06] point I think the cancer fisherald team
[08:07] will come out and say of how they went
[08:08] and they actually audited it. Um but now
[08:10] tether even has an at test station that
[08:13] they put on their website where you can
[08:14] go and you can see exactly where are all
[08:16] the funds, what is it uh sitting in. Um
[08:18] and then not only breakdown of like this
[08:20] is cash and cash equivalents but also
[08:21] how many treasuries do they own, how
[08:23] much bitcoin is in there. Not just
[08:24] Tether though. I mean beyond Tether, is
[08:26] this something that the major like a PWC
[08:29] or some of the other accounting firms
[08:31] can vouch for? What what what would make
[08:32] you feel comfortable as an I think a lot
[08:34] of those firms at first were very
[08:36] nervous about this because it was new,
[08:37] right? They just didn't understand it.
[08:38] They frankly probably were like you
[08:40] might pay us some money but we're taking
[08:41] a lot of legal risk in coming out and
[08:42] doing this. Uh that is quickly changing.
[08:44] Obviously we circle is now a publicly
[08:46] traded company. I think that Tether has
[08:47] done a fantastic job of going and
[08:49] meeting with regulators and politicians
[08:50] and really kind of helping to explain
[08:52] what is the uh business, how's the
[08:54] technology work and now you're starting
[08:55] to see a lot of these auditors, these
[08:56] accountants and various kind of uh
[08:58] regulatory friendly service providers
[09:00] because in the early days it was a bit
[09:01] of the wild west and there were a lot of
[09:03] these sort of situations where it wasn't
[09:05] backed up. It wasn't what people said. I
[09:07] know we've come a long way from that,
[09:08] but how do you feel completely
[09:10] comfortable as an investor? Well, you
[09:11] know, I think there's two different
[09:12] groups of people, right? I think there's
[09:13] the crypto community who frankly they
[09:15] don't care, right? There there is a
[09:17] subset of the community who just says,
[09:18] "Hey, look, I'm basically holding
[09:19] Bitcoin or some token. I need to go from
[09:21] this exchange to another exchange. I
[09:23] need to pay someone. It's a quick
[09:24] transaction. If later on something
[09:26] happens to this token, it doesn't
[09:27] matter." I think that that is a very
[09:29] small group of people today. And I
[09:30] actually think now everyone is saying,
[09:32] "Look, this is really really important.
[09:33] We need to figure this out." And so
[09:34] these companies are probably more
[09:37] transparent than most of the uh
[09:38] traditional financial system in terms of
[09:40] day-to-day uh updating of what are the
[09:43] reserves, where do they sit, what are
[09:44] the different service providers that
[09:45] will actually offer them stuff. Um and
[09:47] so as an investor, I think you just have
[09:48] to ask yourself uh am I willing to take
[09:51] whatever risk I perceive to be there? I
[09:53] happen to think that there's very low
[09:54] risk to the USDC's and USDTs of the
[09:56] world. Uh some other people may think
[09:58] that there's more and and you know
[09:59] they'll kind of act accordingly.
[10:02] All right, Anthony, you said the
[10:03] dollar's been strong. It depends on
[10:06] really where you other people think it's
[10:08] been the worst start to a year. Well,
[10:10] this year is different than, you know,
[10:12] last 5 to 10 last 5 to 10 years it's
[10:14] been dollars and Bitcoin, right?
[10:15] Exactly. Especially if you own something
[10:17] else in in a country with really high
[10:20] inflation, you know, you work your ass
[10:21] off. You get you got nothing in a year.
[10:24] It's two things that people in the world
[10:25] want. They want dollars and they want
[10:26] Bitcoin. That's for sure. Exactly. All
[10:28] right. Thank
