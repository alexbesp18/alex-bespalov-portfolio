[00:00] What's going on, guys? Today we've got
[00:01] an excellent episode with John Pompiano.
[00:03] We do rapid fire. We go through all
[00:05] things Bitcoin, Bitcoin bonds, what's
[00:07] going on with hash rate, what should we
[00:09] actually expect from legislation about
[00:10] the United States buying Bitcoin, and
[00:12] much, much more. Then we also talk about
[00:14] the stock market and why so many people
[00:16] missed the most recent rally, what it
[00:18] means for your portfolio, and how I
[00:20] personally expect stocks to perform
[00:22] through the end of the year. This
[00:23] conversation's full with insights that I
[00:25] haven't shared anywhere else, so I hope
[00:26] that you enjoy it. Here's my latest
[00:27] conversation with John Pompiano. All
[00:29] right, John, what's the first topic we
[00:30] got going here? Russia's largest bank,
[00:32] Spur Bank, went ahead and launched a
[00:34] Bitcoin bond. What the hell is a Bitcoin
[00:37] bond? Well, it's very good question. Um,
[00:39] the first thing to understand is that
[00:41] Bitcoin is a uh magnet for capital,
[00:43] right? People want to go put their
[00:45] capital and store it inside of Bitcoin.
[00:47] Obviously, it's very asymmetric. Now,
[00:49] there's different types of Bitcoin
[00:51] bonds, right? A Bitcoin bond is just
[00:52] bonds related to Bitcoin. Now if you go
[00:54] and you take a look there are things in
[00:56] the public market obviously strategy and
[00:58] other companies they're issuing all
[01:00] kinds of uh kind of debt related
[01:02] instruments that could be convertible
[01:03] notes some people are trying to do
[01:04] structured notes there's all kinds of
[01:06] stuff the idea there is hey I give you
[01:08] something you give me capital I take
[01:10] that capital and I go and I buy bitcoin
[01:12] you may convert it to equity later I may
[01:13] pay you some sort of interest whatever
[01:15] there's a lot of stuff happening in the
[01:16] public market people trying to raise
[01:17] money to buy bitcoin got it now the
[01:20] second thing that people have been
[01:21] talking about and it's become a more
[01:22] popular idea over the last three or 4
[01:24] months is this idea of a bit bond. The
[01:26] idea of a bit bond is let's say that the
[01:28] US government would go and they would
[01:30] issue a bond and you give a $100. When
[01:33] you give $100 to buy that bond, what
[01:35] they do is they take 90% of it and they
[01:37] say we're going to go waste it by trying
[01:38] to fund the government. Well, they take
[01:40] 100% of the money right now and go waste
[01:41] it to fund the government. So, they only
[01:42] take 90% this time. So, we already got
[01:44] some improvement. The other 10% they
[01:46] would take and they would buy Bitcoin
[01:48] with it. Now, the idea is that they
[01:50] would promise you some sort of interest
[01:52] rate on it. Let's say maybe it's as low
[01:53] as 1% is what the uh proposal that I've
[01:56] seen from the Bitcoin policy institute.
[01:58] When they issue that bond and tell you
[02:00] that they're going to give you 1%.
[02:01] They've bought 10% Bitcoin. 90% goes to
[02:03] fund the government. Obviously, the
[02:05] thought process that Bitcoin will
[02:06] appreciate in value as that Bitcoin
[02:08] appreciates in value. They may say to
[02:09] you, but you know what we're going to
[02:10] do? We're going to give you 100% of the
[02:13] return of the first four uh.5% of the
[02:16] Bitcoin. So now you got a 1% coupon on
[02:19] the bond. Now you get 4.5% from Bitcoin.
[02:21] They got 5.5%. Sounds pretty good,
[02:24] right? But then they say, "But Bitcoin's
[02:25] probably going to go up even more over a
[02:27] long period of time." And so then after
[02:28] the 4.5% of Bitcoin appreciation, we
[02:31] split it 50/50. So if Bitcoin goes up,
[02:33] let's say another 10% past the 4 and a
[02:36] half, now you would get 5% of that and
[02:38] the government would get 5% of that. And
[02:40] so when you do that, you then now have a
[02:43] way for them to pay much higher rates of
[02:45] interest or return on their bonds, but
[02:48] they're contractually only obligated to
[02:50] pay you 1%. So it's all dependent on the
[02:52] Bitcoin price appreciation.
[02:55] Obviously, if the government's able to
[02:56] do this, they still get 90% of the $100
[02:59] to go and fund the government. That 10%
[03:01] makes it more attractive. It's a way to
[03:03] incentivize people to come in and buy
[03:04] the bonds of the United States. uh use
[03:07] Bitcoin to potentially deliver a better
[03:09] return and also the government may
[03:11] recoup some of the 90% that they wasted
[03:14] to fund the government because they get
[03:16] 50% of the Bitcoin return above the 4.5%
[03:19] initial return. So a bit bond's very
[03:22] interesting because if the government
[03:24] could do this there are some rumors
[03:26] analysis proposals out there that
[03:28] actually this could help address the
[03:29] national debt. Whether it could or not I
[03:31] don't know. So we got the structured
[03:33] stuff and the public market stuff. Then
[03:35] we got the bit bonds and then we have
[03:37] what we saw yesterday which is uh this
[03:39] bank in Russia they decided they were
[03:41] going to issue a bond that is related to
[03:43] Bitcoin. Now what it does is and we're
[03:45] still waiting for a lot of the details
[03:46] but so far what we know is there's
[03:48] basically two different ways that this
[03:50] bond can become more valuable in the
[03:52] future. The first is appreciation of
[03:54] Bitcoin and US dollars. The second is
[03:56] that there is a strengthening of the US
[03:59] dollar against the ruble. And so what
[04:02] you are seeing is essentially the bond
[04:04] market which is a very large liquid deep
[04:07] market of capital is saying to
[04:09] themselves Bitcoin and bonds are going
[04:12] to marry each other and people are going
[04:14] to find all kinds of interesting ways to
[04:16] do it. Uh maybe bit bonds is the thing
[04:18] that's gotten the most attention and
[04:19] then obviously the public company stuff
[04:20] because of these Bitcoin treasury
[04:21] companies but I think that we are going
[04:23] to see people do all kinds of things
[04:26] moving forward. Um, and you already see
[04:28] some of this like Black Rockck has a
[04:29] fixed income fund that they went and
[04:31] they changed the documents so that they
[04:32] could put I think it's up to uh 10 or
[04:34] 15% of that fund into Bitcoin. I don't
[04:37] know if they've actually done that yet
[04:38] or not, but you can see people are
[04:39] saying, "Wait a second. If I take
[04:41] Bitcoin and I add it to a bond or if I
[04:43] add it to a portfolio, the portfolio
[04:45] case, the sharp ratio goes up. If I add
[04:47] it to a bond, maybe the bond will
[04:48] perform better, which means that I can
[04:49] actually raise more capital." That's the
[04:51] future of where a lot of this stuff is
[04:53] going. And I think that is why people
[04:54] are so interested in kind of
[04:56] understanding the intersection of
[04:57] Bitcoin and the bond market. Who's going
[04:59] to buy those bonds? Is it more
[05:01] countries? Is it institutions? Is it,
[05:03] you know, high net worth individuals?
[05:05] Like who who is actually going to
[05:06] benefit from owning these bonds? And
[05:07] like where's the market basically? I
[05:10] think it's all of the above, right?
[05:11] Different people want different things.
[05:12] So some people may be really attracted
[05:14] to buying uh public company issued uh
[05:17] you know kind of debt that is related to
[05:18] Bitcoin. Um they may want to buy the
[05:20] convertible notes. They may say, "Hey,
[05:21] look, I want to lend money and have some
[05:23] downside protection, but then I want to
[05:24] be able to convert into equity at some
[05:26] sort of premium or something, right?"
[05:27] Um, you could see institutions doing
[05:28] that. You could see nation states. You
[05:30] could see sovereign wealth funds. That's
[05:31] similar to the Bitcoin treasury stuff.
[05:33] Yeah. So, like uh take uh strategy as an
[05:35] example. Like a a convertible bond is uh
[05:38] essentially a way for people to say,
[05:39] "Hey, I'm going to give you this IOU,
[05:42] right? You're going to give me uh
[05:44] money." And a lot of these convertible
[05:46] bonds have been done at 0% interest. I
[05:48] don't owe you any interest, but when you
[05:50] give this to me, I am going to give you
[05:52] some downside protection. You get paid
[05:53] first, right? You're at top of the
[05:55] capital stack. There's all these kind of
[05:56] downside protections. Uh, and in
[05:58] exchange for those downside protections,
[05:59] you're not going to be able to convert
[06:00] that bond into um the equity at the
[06:04] current price. You may have to do it at
[06:06] 30, 40, 50% higher, right? And so,
[06:09] there's this trade-off of like how much
[06:11] risk do I want to mitigate versus how
[06:12] much return do I want to try to capture.
[06:14] And so, this is how the bond market
[06:15] works in general. Um, but I think that
[06:17] you're going to see the bond market,
[06:19] which currently services all those
[06:21] groups that you mentioned, they're now
[06:23] just going to start to infuse Bitcoin.
[06:24] And it's less likely that like, oh,
[06:26] individuals will be attracted,
[06:27] institutions won't. What's more likely
[06:29] to happen is 10% of every group, so 10%
[06:31] of institutions, 10% of sovereign wealth
[06:33] funds, 10% of individuals, they'll be
[06:35] attracted to this first, and then over
[06:36] time, that number will become bigger and
[06:38] bigger and bigger. And I think that's
[06:39] really how you bring a lot of capital
[06:40] into the Bitcoin ecosystem. All right.
[06:42] The Bitcoin conference was last week. Uh
[06:44] David Bailey and his team seem to do a
[06:46] fantastic job. Um Pakistan announced
[06:48] that they're going to do a strategic
[06:50] Bitcoin reserve. Are other countries
[06:53] coming? They're all going to do it, of
[06:55] course. Right. It's like saying uh is
[06:57] every country going to have a gold
[06:58] reserve? Of course. Uh they need a way
[07:00] to store value. Now in the United
[07:02] States, and we've talked about this, we
[07:03] have a strategic petroleum reserve. We
[07:05] have a strategic gold reserve. We have a
[07:06] strategic cheese reserve. Right? We got
[07:09] all kinds of crazy stuff. Um, and so if
[07:11] you think about Bitcoin, Bitcoin is just
[07:13] another asset the government is going to
[07:15] hoard in case ABCD different things.
[07:19] Now, why is the United States doing it
[07:21] versus maybe another country? Uh, that's
[07:22] up for debate, right? There are plenty
[07:24] of countries that are going to start
[07:25] buying Bitcoin and creating a strategic
[07:26] reserve because they're worried about US
[07:28] sanctions in the future. There's other
[07:30] countries who say, you know what, I'm a
[07:31] friend of the United States, but just in
[07:32] case, I'm going to buy a little bit of
[07:33] Bitcoin. There's other countries that'll
[07:35] say, you know what, I'm going to put in
[07:36] my sovereign wealth fund. Right? We've
[07:37] seen that start to happen with the
[07:38] exposure to the ETFs. And I think that's
[07:40] going to appreciate in price. So whether
[07:42] you're buying it as a store of value,
[07:43] whether you're buying it for the
[07:44] censorship resistance, whether you're
[07:46] buying it for price appreciation or a
[07:48] multitude of other reasons, it kind of
[07:50] doesn't matter. It's just the fact that
[07:52] you have an asset that millions and
[07:55] millions of people around the world have
[07:56] all decided for different reasons, I
[07:58] want that asset in my personal balance
[08:01] sheet. Well, if it's good enough for
[08:02] individuals, then it's good enough for
[08:04] companies. If it's good enough for
[08:05] individuals and companies, it's going to
[08:06] be good enough for countries. And I
[08:07] think that is the progression that we're
[08:09] seeing here. And as I've talked about
[08:10] for years, the beauty of this is that it
[08:12] started with the individuals.
[08:14] Historically, technology goes from the
[08:16] militaries and the countries to the
[08:17] companies and then the people. We were
[08:19] the last ones, individuals, the last
[08:21] ones to get cell phones. We were the
[08:22] last ones to get laptop computers,
[08:24] right? We're the last ones to use
[08:25] technology because you got to get the
[08:26] cost down enough where an individual can
[08:28] buy it. Bitcoin has completely flipped
[08:30] that. It was actually individuals who
[08:32] adopted it first and we're going back up
[08:34] the stack. And so it was individuals,
[08:36] then it was companies and financial
[08:37] institutions, and now we're getting to
[08:38] sovereign wealth uh funds and nation
[08:40] states, which is pretty cool. That is
[08:41] cool. Um let's talk about Cynthia Lumis
[08:44] a little bit. Uh she said that Trump
[08:46] recently she floated the idea that Trump
[08:48] is supporting the 1 million Bitcoin
[08:50] purchase for the United States. How do
[08:52] we get there? We buy it. But how do we
[08:55] how do we convince, you know, how do how
[08:57] do we get over the edge so they actually
[08:58] buy a million Bitcoin? I don't actually
[09:00] think that we need the congressional uh
[09:03] approvals and stuff. I know that that's
[09:04] the path that we're going to go. But I
[09:06] actually do think that we could just do
[09:07] it um through the executive orders and
[09:10] stuff like that, but if we're going to
[09:12] go this path, great. Um I believe that
[09:15] there are a multitude of ways to get
[09:16] there. Uh one, which I said at one
[09:18] point, I said, "Look, we should have
[09:20] just issued $250 billion worth of debt
[09:22] and just go buy Bitcoin, right? Like a
[09:24] printing money, what like we're going to
[09:25] print the money anyways, guys, right? So
[09:27] like at least let's go use good good use
[09:29] for it." I don't like the idea of
[09:30] printing money, but when I said it, we
[09:32] can go back and check. The price was a
[09:33] lot lower, right? So, we would have
[09:35] already maybe uh wiped off uh some
[09:38] portion of the national debt. Um so,
[09:40] that's one is we can just print the
[09:41] money. The second is that we could stop
[09:43] spending money on dumb things and start
[09:44] spending it on smart things, right? And
[09:46] I'm not somebody who thinks that the
[09:47] government should go put 100% of their
[09:48] assets in Bitcoin, right? Just like I
[09:49] don't think an individual should do that
[09:51] either. Um but I do think that it's
[09:53] probably a higher percentage than most
[09:54] people think. Um, and I think that most
[09:56] Bitcoiners, if you go and you ask them,
[09:57] if you own Bitcoin, very few of them
[09:59] have only 1% of their assets in it.
[10:01] Right? Again, each person's different. I
[10:03] know people who have three to 5%. I know
[10:05] people who have 10%. I know people who
[10:06] have 99%. Right? But the idea that
[10:09] you're only going to put 1% with an idea
[10:11] like Bitcoin is probably not realistic.
[10:13] And so, the US government likely is
[10:14] going to buy more. So, you could stop
[10:16] spending money on things, change the
[10:17] budget up, and just redirect some of
[10:19] those funds to something else. And the
[10:21] third thing is we can uh earn or acquire
[10:24] Bitcoin through other means. Now what do
[10:26] I mean by that? Well, should we have the
[10:28] United States using some of our energy
[10:30] resources to mine Bitcoin? Should we be
[10:33] uh asking other countries to pay us in
[10:36] Bitcoin? Um should we figure out ways to
[10:39] acquire Bitcoin that doesn't require us
[10:42] to take dollars and issue them? Maybe
[10:45] bit bonds, right? Part of the bit bond
[10:47] idea is 50% of that performance over the
[10:49] first four and a half percent goes to
[10:51] the US government. Well, in the proposal
[10:53] from the Bitcoin policy institute, that
[10:55] 50% that goes to the government would go
[10:57] into the strategic Bitcoin reserve. So,
[10:58] you could actually issue debt and
[11:00] somehow end up with more Bitcoin, right?
[11:01] And so, there's all these different ways
[11:03] to do it. Um, but I think that a million
[11:05] coins sounds like a great idea, right?
[11:07] Let's see uh let's see uh if uh the US
[11:09] government can get there. Um what I hope
[11:11] does not happen, it's my big warning. I
[11:14] don't want to see companies
[11:15] nationalized. I don't want to see ETFs
[11:17] nationalized. I don't want to see uh the
[11:20] use of violence or uh the state coming
[11:23] in and uh coercing or taking people's
[11:26] assets. Um so I think that we have to do
[11:28] it, you know, in in the proper way, but
[11:30] the United States should definitely rush
[11:31] and try to get to a million. So I think
[11:32] one thing that's been on a lot of
[11:33] people's mind recently is we've seen all
[11:36] these companies buying Bitcoin, right?
[11:38] GameStop was probably one of the most
[11:39] recent companies to announce, you know,
[11:40] a multi-billion dollar purchase of
[11:42] Bitcoin. Why isn't the price going up? I
[11:45] think that's a big concern. Yeah, I
[11:46] think that's a big concern for retail is
[11:48] look like everyone's buying, buying,
[11:49] buying, buying, buying, but my stack's
[11:51] still the same size. Yeah, this a little
[11:53] bit of alpha for folks. Um, today's

[12:40] Go check them out. Today you are seeing
[12:42] people buy uh what they are essentially
[12:44] doing is they are going and they are
[12:46] putting money into these companies. But
[12:48] a lot of the people who are putting
[12:49] money into these companies, they are
[12:51] more so arbing the difference between
[12:55] the price of Bitcoin and the premium
[12:58] that the public companies are trading
[12:59] at. So, for example, if uh I have a
[13:02] company that um I want to invest in, and
[13:05] that company says to me, "If you give me
[13:07] uh a hundred,000 $105,000, I'm going to
[13:10] go buy one Bitcoin." Great. Well, they
[13:12] issue me that at their current share
[13:14] price, right? So, I give them $15,000. I
[13:17] now have one share of, let's say, their
[13:19] company, and there's one Bitcoin backing
[13:21] it. I then, because I am long their
[13:23] stock, go and I short Bitcoin for
[13:27] $105,000. Now, you say, "Well, if you're
[13:29] long 105,000 and you're short 105,000,
[13:32] what's the difference?" Well, the third
[13:34] piece of that equation is that these
[13:36] companies are not trading at NAV.
[13:38] They're trading at a premium. So, if the
[13:39] company now is trading at 150%, right?
[13:42] Kind of a 0.5% uh or.5x uh premium. I
[13:46] now have neutral exposure to the market.
[13:50] I'm not long or short Bitcoin because
[13:51] I'm long the stock. I'm short Bitcoin.
[13:54] But what I'm essentially doing is uh in
[13:56] a very generalized manner, I'm locking
[13:58] in that premium. So I basically got you
[14:01] know again generalized 50% return
[14:05] because without taking risk to the
[14:07] market of Bitcoin going up or down. So
[14:08] when you see the dollars coming into the
[14:10] market, what you're seeing is oh look at
[14:13] all billions of dollars is coming in to
[14:14] buy Bitcoin. What you're not seeing in
[14:17] the announcements is a lot not all but a
[14:19] lot of that capital is going and hedging
[14:22] elsewhere. And so they're essentially
[14:24] just balancing themselves out. So for
[14:27] every dollar long, there's a dollar
[14:28] short. Now again, that's not 100% of
[14:30] people, right? We have seen Bitcoin's
[14:32] price appreciate over the last, you
[14:34] know, whatever couple of months. Um but
[14:36] I do think I think it was at 70,000 uh
[14:39] on November 1st or $69,000. Uh and so,
[14:42] you know, in less than a year, we're
[14:43] already up from 70 to 105. Like, hey,
[14:47] let's not be greedy here. We're up 50%.
[14:49] Right? Um, but I do think that as people
[14:52] are seeing so much buying coming into
[14:53] the market, a huge part of this is that
[14:56] there are long dollars that are being
[14:58] hedged on the short side. And so the
[14:59] question becomes, you know, do those
[15:01] some of those shorts get blown out at
[15:02] some point? Um, is there a short
[15:05] squeeze? Uh, do those people take that
[15:07] stuff off? They sell the shares and then
[15:09] they take off the short at the same
[15:11] time. A lot of unknowns in the market
[15:13] and it's hard to really understand what
[15:15] are the exact numbers, right? you know,
[15:16] how much capital is long, how much
[15:18] capital short, what other hedges are
[15:20] they using in derivatives or spot, like
[15:22] it's just very very difficult. People
[15:23] smarter than me can try to figure it
[15:24] out. Um, but that is one of the main
[15:26] reasons why you're not seeing Bitcoin's
[15:28] price just explode is because there's
[15:30] actually kind of a a neutralizing effect
[15:33] of uh the capital that's going into
[15:34] these companies. Staying on the topic of
[15:36] market participants, Bitcoin hash rate
[15:38] reached an all-time high. Uh, what's
[15:40] going on with the market? more are there
[15:42] more miners online and you know it's
[15:44] just pushing the hash rate up or what is
[15:45] the correlation between price hash rate
[15:47] and market participants? Well, I think
[15:49] that there's just a long-term trend
[15:51] about uh the Bitcoin hardware for mining
[15:54] gets more and more efficient over time.
[15:55] You know, if you go back and you look at
[15:56] even like the S9 which you know I don't
[15:58] know about a decade ago or so uh was the
[16:01] uh equipment to today like the equipment
[16:04] is way way better. Also, not only is it
[16:06] just like pure hardware improvements,
[16:08] but what we do with the hardware. So,
[16:10] things like immersive cooling, right, is
[16:13] a completely different way to think
[16:15] about setting up these facilities than
[16:17] air cooled facilities and and where you
[16:19] can do them and how you do them and all
[16:20] this kind of stuff. So, I think that's
[16:22] kind of one big thing is you would
[16:23] expect that as these companies get
[16:25] bigger, they get more access to capital,
[16:26] they're buying more efficient machines,
[16:28] there's kind of a persistent tailwind
[16:29] that that happens there. The second
[16:31] thing is that people want Bitcoin. And
[16:33] so just like people are buying Bitcoin
[16:34] in the spot market, that means people
[16:35] are incentivized to mine Bitcoin as
[16:37] well. Uh mining is a hard game though,
[16:39] right? And so you're not only seeing
[16:40] very large players do it, you're trying
[16:42] you're seeing people very small try as
[16:44] well. Um but it's a very difficult
[16:46] capital intensive game to get it right
[16:47] and especially be able to weather kind
[16:49] of these cycles, but people want to do
[16:50] it. Um and I think the third thing is
[16:52] that you're just generally across the
[16:54] world seeing more computing power come
[16:55] online. as you see more computing power
[16:57] come online, people are choosing should
[16:59] I do it with artificial intelligence um
[17:01] and and some of the computational needs
[17:02] there. Should I do things with Bitcoin
[17:04] or or something in between? Um but I
[17:06] think you're just seeing in general us
[17:08] move from kind of an industrial
[17:10] manufacturing physical world uh you know
[17:12] type economy to something that is much
[17:14] more about uh electrical robotics
[17:17] computation power you know all that
[17:19] stuff. And so naturally, if that is a
[17:21] big generational shift that we're living
[17:22] through, you're going to see more and
[17:23] more computing power come online for all
[17:25] kinds of use cases. And obviously,
[17:26] Bitcoin will be a big winner there, too.
[17:28] Okay. Uh JD Vance recently got
[17:30] interviewed and seemed to be pretty
[17:31] bullish on Bitcoin uh and looking
[17:32] forward to the future. How much of this
[17:35] is sent uh sentiment versus, you know,
[17:37] hey, we're actually going to do
[17:38] something and we're kind of sitting,
[17:39] we're waiting, we're learning. Um and
[17:41] then, you know, in 2, three months,
[17:43] maybe they announce something or maybe
[17:44] they they get into the market a little
[17:45] bit deeper. I don't know. Um, but what I
[17:48] do know is, uh, I don't want to be short
[17:50] the US government, right, in uh, in
[17:53] things like this. There's plenty of
[17:55] things that you could short the US
[17:56] government on in terms of, you know, uh,
[17:58] their treasuries or, you know, all kinds
[18:00] of stuff that that they're involved in.
[18:01] But when you have something where there
[18:03] is an asymmetric information uh aspect
[18:06] to it where at any moment in time the
[18:10] government can go and buy Bitcoin
[18:12] announce it and it probably will have a
[18:14] positive impact on price and the people
[18:16] who are responsible for the
[18:18] administration and those potential
[18:20] decisions. They're talking bullish. I
[18:23] you don't want to get caught off sides,
[18:24] right? And so I think that it goes back
[18:26] to we could sit and then analyze, you
[18:28] know, what are the words JD Vance used?
[18:30] to see, you know, tipping something off.
[18:31] Do people think, you know, this date or
[18:33] that date or this amount or or whatever?
[18:35] But I always go come back and kind of
[18:36] zoom out for a second. I say, look,
[18:38] Bitcoin is an asset that has sound money
[18:41] principles that's decentralized, that
[18:43] continues to appreciate at a very
[18:45] attractive rate compared to other assets
[18:46] in the market. In a way, Bitcoin has
[18:48] become the hurdle rate for an entire new
[18:50] generation, myself included. If you
[18:52] can't beat it, you got to buy it. Okay?
[18:56] Then it almost doesn't matter what the
[18:57] administration does. It doesn't matter
[18:59] what people are saying. It doesn't
[19:00] matter about bit bonds and this and bam
[19:02] bam whatever, right? Instead, the best
[19:05] strategy for people over the last 15
[19:07] years was to simply just continue to
[19:09] dollar cost average into Bitcoin and
[19:11] don't worry about it. It's kind of like
[19:12] the S&P like is the S&P going to go up,
[19:13] down, sideways, backwards, whatever.
[19:15] Like, I don't know. I just know that the
[19:17] S&P goes up and to the right at a 45
[19:18] degree angle because they've not stopped
[19:20] to print money. Okay. Well, you should
[19:21] just keep dollar cost averaging into the
[19:23] S&P, right? Bitcoin very much is
[19:25] becoming that thing for an entire new
[19:27] generation. And so um it's
[19:28] intellectually stimulating to talk about
[19:30] and learn about and you know try to
[19:32] predict what's going to happen in the
[19:33] future. But at the end of the day really
[19:34] what we're seeing here is just people
[19:36] are going to keep putting capital into
[19:37] the Bitcoin network and that likely is
[19:40] going to continue to give them a return
[19:41] that they are excited about so that they
[19:43] keep putting more and more capital into
[19:45] which then has a reinforcing effect to
[19:47] it which drives the price higher and
[19:48] higher over time. I'm glad you mentioned
[19:50] the S&P. Let's talk about stocks for a
[19:52] second. Uh there's a comment saying
[19:54] doomers make headlines, optimists make
[19:56] money. In May, it was the best month for
[19:59] stocks in 30 best May for stocks in 35
[20:02] years. Why? Well, it's a classic example
[20:06] of uh surprise, everyone was off sides,
[20:10] right? Um if you go back to uh February,
[20:14] today's episode is brought to you by
[20:16] Core, you can earn yield on your Bitcoin
[20:18] by just holding your Bitcoin. It's
[20:20] simple. Core, the leading Bitcoin
[20:22] scaling solution, will reward you for
[20:24] not selling your Bitcoin. It's not
[20:25] magic. Here's how it works. Core is a
[20:28] protocol secured by elected validators.
[20:30] You can help elect validators and secure
[20:32] the network by simply locking up your
[20:33] Bitcoin on the Bitcoin blockchain. No
[20:35] bridging, no lending, and just holding.
[20:38] When your validator secures core, it
[20:40] earns rewards fueled by network activity
[20:42] and passes them back to you as yield.
[20:44] With a minimum lock up of just one day,
[20:46] when the time lock ends, you get your
[20:48] Bitcoin back untouched. Steal your keys,
[20:50] steal your coins, now your yield. For
[20:53] even higher rates, stake core alongside
[20:55] your Bitcoin and multiply your yield.
[20:57] And if you want to see what your Bitcoin
[20:58] is securing, join millions of others in
[21:00] exploring the largest Bitcoin DeFi
[21:02] ecosystem. There are over a 100 live
[21:04] apps in the network and the deepest
[21:06] liquidity in all of Bitcoin DeFi. Get
[21:08] off zero and start earning yield on even
[21:10] just 1% of your Bitcoin by going to

[21:22] Today's episode is brought to you by
[21:24] Polka Dot. Polka Dot offers secure,
[21:26] scalable, and decentralized blockchain
[21:27] technology that perfectly aligns with
[21:29] the needs of innovative projects. It was
[21:31] developed by Gavin Wood, one of the
[21:33] co-founders of Ethereum and the creator
[21:34] of Solidity. Polka Dot aims to build an
[21:37] internet where users have full control
[21:38] over their data and their applications.
[21:41] Polka Dot offers tons of unique
[21:43] features, a shared security model along
[21:45] with a new auction model and significant
[21:47] implementations like ASIC banking. Given
[21:49] these characteristics, it's easy to
[21:51] understand why Polka Dot is gaining more
[21:52] and more traction in the cryptocurrency
[21:54] world. Some people even are talking
[21:56] about it as the AWS of web 3. Now,
[22:00] companies such as Mythical Games, Astro
[22:02] Network, and over 50 other independent
[22:04] blockchains with hundreds of
[22:05] applications already leverage Polka
[22:07] Dot's technology to power their
[22:08] platforms. If you're looking for a
[22:10] reliable, scalable, and cutting edge
[22:12] solution, Polka Dot seems to be the top
[22:14] choice for industry players. Go check
[22:16] them out today at polka dot.com. It's a
[22:19] classic example of uh surprise, everyone
[22:23] was off sides, right? Um if you go back
[22:26] to uh February, I think that there was a
[22:30] lot of folks when they first started
[22:31] talking about the tariffs were like,
[22:32] "Ah, this negotiating posture. They're
[22:34] not really going to put tariffs on our
[22:36] two, you know, two of our three largest
[22:38] trading partners. They're not really
[22:39] going to tariff Mexico and Canada." And
[22:41] then bam, bam, it was like I think in
[22:43] like one week or maybe in the same day
[22:45] or whatever, right? and they just
[22:46] knocked both of them and all of a sudden
[22:47] people were like, "Uhoh, like didn't
[22:50] expect that." And so that was the first
[22:52] surprise was people thought it was a
[22:54] posturing thing and it turned out to be
[22:56] a reality thing, right? I don't even
[22:58] remember if I had an opinion as to
[22:59] whether they were really going to do it
[23:00] or not do it. I think it was just kind
[23:01] of like, hey, they're talking about
[23:02] this. Maybe they do it, maybe they
[23:03] don't. I I don't really remember um at
[23:05] that po uh moment.
[23:08] Fast forward through February, March, we
[23:10] got some announcements. This is whatever
[23:11] gets to Liberation Day. Everyone
[23:13] remembers they brought out the the
[23:15] poster boards like they were doing a
[23:16] seventh grade science fair, right? You
[23:18] know, Howard Lutnick there. He had his
[23:19] little thing. Bam, bam, this what we're
[23:21] doing. And people were like, "Yo, these
[23:24] guys ain't playing around, right?" And
[23:27] you had a choice. It was a It was a a
[23:29] fork in the road. You either believed
[23:31] what they were saying or you didn't
[23:33] believe what they were saying. And I
[23:36] chose to simply listen. I said, "There
[23:39] are people who are making these
[23:41] decisions with more information than I
[23:42] have." and they also have the benefit of
[23:44] understanding what their ultimate
[23:45] strategy is and their goal, etc. If they
[23:47] tell me that they're trying to get the
[23:49] 10-year yield down, I'm going to believe
[23:51] them. If they tell me that they are
[23:53] going to put the tariffs in place, I'm
[23:56] going to believe them. If they tell me
[23:58] that inflation is not going to come,
[24:00] then I'm going to believe them. Right?
[24:02] And there's a lot of people, and I took
[24:03] a lot of heat. I mean, how many times
[24:05] have you and I talked privately where I
[24:07] would tweet things or talk about this
[24:09] stuff? I got attacked mercilessly.
[24:12] Still, I'm still getting people who just
[24:15] will not stop. And what they essentially
[24:18] said, if I had to characterize all of
[24:20] the attacks, was the following. You're
[24:23] dumb. You're some MAGA mouthpiece, and
[24:26] you don't know what you're talking
[24:27] about. We all have reached consensus
[24:29] that tariffs equal bad. Tariff equal
[24:31] inflation. That's basically their their
[24:34] entire talk. And as I've talked about on
[24:36] this podcast many, many times, I knew
[24:37] they were all wrong when disscent was
[24:41] outlawed. The second that they all said
[24:43] you can't have a different opinion, I
[24:45] said the different opinion is right. And
[24:46] so I said, "Okay, well, let me go and
[24:48] let me do the work. These guys are
[24:50] saying that there's not going to be
[24:50] inflation. These guys are saying all
[24:52] this stuff." I get that it's political
[24:53] posturing and talking and all this
[24:55] nonsense, but what if they're right?
[24:57] Right. And one of the experiences that
[25:00] I've had in my life that actually drove
[25:02] me, and I haven't shared this yet, is um
[25:04] I went down to uh to Texas a couple
[25:08] years ago and I had the pleasure of
[25:10] going to lunch with Kyle Bass. Kyle
[25:13] Bass, a famous investor. He shorted the
[25:15] housing market, everything. And
[25:16] afterwards, uh Kyle was kind enough, we
[25:18] went back to his house and uh we sat
[25:20] there and and we record a podcast
[25:22] episode. Um, it's one of my favorite
[25:24] episodes because Kyle said something to
[25:25] me in there that uh was one of those
[25:28] like uh small off-hand comments that I
[25:31] extrapolated out and I use all the time
[25:32] in my life. And what Kyle said to me was
[25:35] uh the reason he knew to short the
[25:37] housing market is because he was looking
[25:39] into housing and he kept asking people
[25:43] uh that were analysts, okay, oh you have
[25:45] this model that housing prices this and
[25:47] mortgages whatever. um all of your
[25:50] models
[25:51] go up. They all say that housing keeps
[25:54] going up. What if housing doesn't go up
[25:57] for a year or 2 years? And they were
[25:59] like, "Well, no. Housing always goes up.
[26:01] Like that never happens." And he was
[26:03] like, "But what if it does?" Right? And
[26:05] so that gave him the intellectual
[26:07] curiosity to go and investigate more and
[26:10] say, "Well, what are the odds that it
[26:12] goes down? What happens in that?" And he
[26:14] uncovered what was probably one of the
[26:15] greatest trades of our lifetime. Um, to
[26:19] me the tariff situation, understanding
[26:21] that Kyle Bass story drove me to say,
[26:24] well, what if the tariffs actually don't
[26:26] lead to inflation? What are the odds of
[26:28] that? Right? And that's what I I went
[26:29] and I looked. So, if you bring that to
[26:31] stocks, there's a bunch of people who
[26:34] listened to the mainstream media, the
[26:36] conversation in social media, listened
[26:37] to their economic professor at college
[26:39] and said tariffs equal bad, bad equals
[26:42] inflation, inflation equals stocks go
[26:44] down. And here's the thing is that
[26:47] stocks did go down. They went down 15 to
[26:49] 20% depending on the different index
[26:51] etc. Um but let's say 20%.
[26:54] Because famous Buffett quote
[26:57] the stock market is a voting machine in
[26:59] the short term. It's a weighing machine
[27:00] in the long term. And so guess what?
[27:02] When it was down 20% I came on here I
[27:05] said alltime high before the end of the
[27:06] year. That don't look so crazy now. When
[27:08] we're down 20% it looks insane. And I
[27:10] knew that and I took the heat for it.
[27:12] But I think I'm going to end up being
[27:13] right. And I'm more convicted than ever.
[27:14] we're going to hit an all-time high
[27:15] before the end of the year. Now, we may
[27:16] not, but I think we will. And so, if you
[27:19] go and you fast forward to, okay, well,
[27:20] let's look at the month of May, and
[27:22] there's this guy, Ryan Dietrich. He is
[27:23] the chief market strategist at the
[27:25] Carson Group. It's like a $40 billion
[27:27] RAIA. Uh, I recently did a podcast
[27:30] interview with him, uh, on our new show,
[27:32] From the Desk of Anthony Pompiano, which
[27:33] you can watch on YouTube and also on X.
[27:36] Um, and in that conversation, Ryan
[27:38] walked through the fact that the S&P 500
[27:40] returned 6% in the month of May. Now,
[27:43] why is that important? That has only
[27:45] happened six times in history. And all
[27:47] six times within 12 months, 100% of the
[27:49] time, the stock market is higher.
[27:51] Average return 20%. So, if you go and
[27:54] you look at this, you say, "Wait a
[27:55] second. The month of May, he says, is
[27:57] the single best predictor of performance
[27:59] for the next year. Out of all the
[28:01] different months, month of May is really
[28:02] important." And if the month of May the
[28:04] S&P appreciates more than 5%, 84% of the
[28:08] time we rocking and rolling through the
[28:11] short term, 100% of the time or long
[28:12] run. And so if it went up 6% in May,
[28:16] listen, maybe maybe history doesn't
[28:18] repeat, but it sure does rhyme a lot.
[28:20] And so my guess is that we're going to
[28:21] see a very very good performance in the
[28:24] stock market. Um, and I think that's
[28:27] okay. Like this is like the most hated
[28:29] rally of all time. People are like, "Ah,
[28:32] it shouldn't be going up." Well, like
[28:35] you could take that perspective or you
[28:38] could take the perspective that the
[28:39] market's the referee and the market is
[28:41] telling you that maybe your world view,
[28:43] your framework was incorrect. So, you
[28:45] can fight it and be like, "Ah, the
[28:48] market is wrong." Or you can say to
[28:51] yourself, "Maybe I missed something.
[28:53] Maybe I don't understand some component
[28:55] of this." And go do the work to try to
[28:56] figure that out. Um, and we're going to
[28:58] have both people, right? That's how
[29:00] markets get made. That's why some people
[29:01] are still selling. That's why
[29:02] institutions are sitting on the
[29:03] sidelines. The institutions are too
[29:05] smart. They look at all these data
[29:07] points, doing all the calculations,
[29:09] whatever, right? It's like, you ever
[29:10] seen the the memes? It's like, you know,
[29:11] this is my quant and they got, you know,
[29:13] some some whatever. Guess what retail
[29:15] did? Retail simply just said, I'm
[29:18] buying. I don't care how far it falls.
[29:20] It's going to come back. I'm buying.
[29:21] Discount. Buy buy. Hand over fist. Buy
[29:25] as much as you can. I saw another uh
[29:27] data point. It maybe came from Ryan,
[29:29] maybe from somebody else. Uh, US retail
[29:31] investors have bought $50 billion of
[29:34] stocks since I think April or March.
[29:36] Huge number. But here's what's most
[29:38] interesting. On down days, dips, retail
[29:42] heavily bought. The performance of the
[29:44] next day after a down day has been.36%.
[29:49] Which doesn't like 36%. What?
[29:53] Historically, the performance of the
[29:55] stock market the day after a down day is
[29:57] 0.02. 02%.
[29:59] So call it 15x plus higher performance
[30:05] the day after a down day. What is that?
[30:06] That's retail buying the dip. And so if
[30:08] you see that play out, you say to
[30:10] yourself, we got two different players
[30:12] in the market. Now institutions are
[30:14] still larger. I think that the numbers
[30:15] like retail investors have about 36 or
[30:17] 38% of uh uh stock um you know
[30:21] allocations. Um but that used to be a
[30:23] lot lower. At some point they're going
[30:25] to flip. retail will be bigger than the
[30:26] institutions, I believe. Oh, you think
[30:28] so? Well, that's the trend, right? I
[30:31] don't know. Maybe it takes 20 years, but
[30:32] like if we're at 36, 38, whatever the
[30:34] number is, like if you just increase by
[30:38] 50%.
[30:40] You're knocking on the door now, right?
[30:42] 50. Well, do you think it's going to
[30:44] grow more than 50% their share of the
[30:46] market, right? Over the next 10 years,
[30:49] 20 years. Of course, we're shifting from
[30:53] a world that used to be all about
[30:55] institutions and financial adviserss and
[30:56] stock brokers and all that stuff to a
[30:58] world where all that's being compressed,
[31:00] the fees are being compressed, that's
[31:01] becoming harder for the people to run
[31:02] those businesses. Uh the idea of
[31:04] quotequote advice, what you think AI is
[31:06] not going to start to play a role, give
[31:08] people the ability to allocate directly
[31:09] to the market. Like the trend is we are
[31:11] going to have a rise of self-directed
[31:13] investors.
[31:14] Okay. Well, individuals, self-directed,
[31:17] independent, retail, whatever you want
[31:18] to call them, they're going to have a
[31:20] larger and larger share of the stock
[31:21] market moving forward. Hot take. I
[31:23] actually think most people should be
[31:24] self-directed and not use an adviser. It
[31:27] it depends what you're trying to
[31:28] accomplish, right? I know some advisers
[31:29] that are amazing. I know a lot of
[31:31] adviserss who are idiots, right? And
[31:33] everything in between. But guess what? I
[31:34] know some doctors that are really good.
[31:36] I know a lot of doctors that are idiots,
[31:38] right? I know some investors that are
[31:39] really good. I know a lot of investors
[31:41] that are idiots. And so it just goes
[31:43] back to like anything the top 1% or the
[31:46] top 10% of a profession are really
[31:48] really good and then the below average
[31:52] people are below average right so I
[31:54] think it's just um if if you need
[31:57] certain types of advice if you need
[31:58] certain types of services if you need
[32:00] certain types of products go find the
[32:02] best at it and I think that financial
[32:04] advice is an area where you probably
[32:05] don't want to skimp out on oh this
[32:08] person's not as good as the other person
[32:09] but you know they're going to charge me
[32:10] a little less in fees fees like it's
[32:12] kind of to me right in my opinion uh
[32:15] that's a place where you probably want
[32:16] to pay you know you want to get what you
[32:18] pay for and so uh finding the right type
[32:20] of financial I'm not in the financial
[32:22] advising game right I don't I don't do
[32:23] that um but if it was me that is the the
[32:27] thing that I would look at is just like
[32:28] hey who's the person who can give me the
[32:29] best advice not who's the person who's
[32:31] going to charge me the least so you
[32:32] talked about S&P hitting an all-time
[32:34] high this year you and Tom Lee seem to
[32:36] be kind of on board with that he was on
[32:38] CNBC yesterday talking about a $6600 $00
[32:41] uh S&P. Um what are the important
[32:44] metrics to watch as we go throughout the
[32:46] year, right? Um is it, hey, look, let's
[32:49] look at the futures market. Is it, hey,
[32:50] look, let's just look at broader
[32:52] sentiment um or sentiment in the market.
[32:55] Uh what are what are you looking at to
[32:56] hit that new all-time high? I think that
[32:59] you we've got a couple data points. The
[33:00] first is are they going to print money?
[33:02] And it looks like they are, right? Looks
[33:04] like they're going to blow out the
[33:05] freaking deficit. So, um I don't like
[33:08] it. It's good for asset prices.
[33:09] dichotomy. Not good for my country,
[33:11] great for my portfolio. Um, I think
[33:13] there's a lot of people who they're
[33:15] sitting there saying, I'd actually give
[33:17] up a little bit on my financial returns
[33:19] if it was better for my country. I
[33:21] definitely would do that. I am not the
[33:23] decision maker. So, not good for my
[33:25] country. It's going to be great for my
[33:26] portfolio. I think that's one big thing.
[33:27] Uh, the second thing is that um you need
[33:30] to watch uh GDP growth. Q2
[33:35] we're going to be booming.
[33:38] Booming. Is that based off tariff
[33:39] revenue? Booming. No, it's the fact that
[33:43] everyone was contracting.
[33:45] Oh no. Tariffs, economic downturn,
[33:48] doomsday, recession. Remember,
[33:50] recession, depression, Black Friday, all
[33:52] the crazy things people were predicting.
[33:54] The second that they were like, ah,
[33:58] tariffs are lower. Let's get rocking and
[33:59] rolling. Boom. Here we go. We're booming
[34:02] again. And I think that there's going to
[34:04] be a big time GDP jump. by the way,
[34:10] no recession. If we boom in Q2, there
[34:12] ain't no recession, like I told you. Uh,
[34:14] and I think that that's not priced in
[34:17] yet. So, that can drive asset prices
[34:19] higher. Um, I also think job growth has
[34:23] stayed very steady for the most part.
[34:25] People still getting jobs. Jordi Visser,
[34:27] who we talk with every Saturday, amazing
[34:29] episode. Many of you like it. Uh, he has
[34:32] said all along, you can't have a
[34:33] recession if you don't have job loss,
[34:35] right? And then I think that there is
[34:38] going to be a bunch of deregulation and
[34:40] tax breaks and stuff. Again, just
[34:41] pushing capital pushing innovation into
[34:44] the economy. And so I think we are going
[34:46] to have the golden age. We're going to
[34:48] have the economic boom, all the things
[34:49] that were promised. I think that we took
[34:51] a very winding, you know, route with no
[34:53] straight line. Um there are things that
[34:56] the administration was talking about
[34:57] that I really like and excited about
[34:59] them doing. There's things that they're
[35:01] doing that I think, you know, hey, I
[35:02] probably wouldn't do that if I was them,
[35:04] right? Um, but I think there is some
[35:06] sobering going on of uh people across
[35:09] both sides of the aisle. The people who
[35:12] are big- time critics are like, "All
[35:12] right, maybe this isn't going to be as
[35:13] bad as I thought it was going to be."
[35:15] The people who were supporters, they're
[35:17] saying, "Hey, you know what? Not
[35:18] everything is, you know, uh, flowers and
[35:20] roses and and uh, sunshine." And then
[35:23] there's people like me who are in the
[35:24] middle who say, "Look, I'm an
[35:25] independent. There's some things I like.
[35:26] There's some things I don't like.
[35:27] There's some things that the Democrats
[35:28] do I like, some things they don't do.
[35:30] That's fine. Whatever. I'm I'm a
[35:31] rational person, right? Not no one I
[35:33] know is 100% bad or 100% good. Right?
[35:36] You can go and you can look and there
[35:37] are people like the the dichotomy of
[35:39] life or the paradox of life is the fact
[35:41] that you can have somebody who's a
[35:42] murderer who still does something
[35:44] positive.
[35:46] Murder's bad. You should go to jail,
[35:48] right? You should be in trouble.
[35:49] Obviously, this is common sense. But how
[35:53] do you explain that? Right? And so the
[35:56] same thing happens when it comes to
[35:57] politics or whatever is they can do
[35:59] something that is absolutely asinine.
[36:00] They're like, "What are you doing?" But
[36:03] then you can say something else in their
[36:06] activities or or legislation or
[36:07] whatever, and you're like, "That's a
[36:08] good idea." That's what we've lost, I
[36:10] think, in this country is the ability to
[36:12] say, "Let me look at topic by topic.
[36:15] What do I agree with? What do I not
[36:17] agree with? Everything is just blue or
[36:18] red, right?" And I I think that's a bad
[36:20] way to look at it. And if you really ask
[36:22] me why I think a lot of people miss this
[36:24] entire economic situation is because
[36:26] they were blue or red. Now, the red
[36:29] people seem to have done better because
[36:32] they believed, right? But I don't see
[36:35] blue or red. I'm like, uh, what is it?
[36:36] Blue and red mix. They you get green, I
[36:38] think. Right. I'm a green person. And,
[36:41] uh, it's just like, look, I I think that
[36:43] there's both sides, whatever. In this
[36:44] specific case around terrorists, I I I
[36:47] believed what they said, right? And it
[36:49] seems like that's working out. There's
[36:51] other things I don't believe, right? And
[36:53] that's fine. But I think that is really
[36:55] how you're going to see this play out.
[36:56] So if you look at the economic data
[36:58] points, it's growth, it's jobs, it's
[37:00] printing of money. It's all the normal
[37:01] stuff. It's right there in front of your
[37:03] face. Global liquidity is telling you
[37:05] where asset prices are going. All you
[37:06] have to do is open your eyes and look at
[37:09] the chart. Guess what? Up. Here we go. I
[37:14] appreciate you being uh on the fence
[37:17] because I know you get called a MAGA
[37:18] mouthpiece. You also get called a
[37:19] Democratic mouthpiece on the same video.
[37:21] Uh that that literally happened.
[37:23] Literally, people in the comments will
[37:24] be like, "You're a magma mouthpiece."
[37:25] And then there'll be somebody else and
[37:26] they'll be like, "Look at this Democrat
[37:28] left-leaning shill." Like, can't win.
[37:30] Well, well, that is winning. To me, that
[37:33] is winning. That people are so confused
[37:36] that I could somehow be accused of being
[37:38] both,
[37:40] right? That's that that says more about
[37:42] them than it says about me. 100%. All
[37:44] right. I think that's it for today. All
[37:46] right. Thanks for doing it. Yep.
