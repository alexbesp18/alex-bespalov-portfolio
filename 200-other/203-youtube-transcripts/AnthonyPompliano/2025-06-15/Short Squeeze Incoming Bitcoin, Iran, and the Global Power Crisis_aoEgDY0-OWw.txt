[00:00] But do you still see the possibility for
[00:02] some sort of uh short squeeze to to
[00:04] drive the price higher? I I think it's
[00:06] going to happen and I think there'll be
[00:07] a month that it goes on and I think it's
[00:09] going to be a painful I think it's going
[00:11] to be a painful move for a lot of
[00:12] people. Uh the FOMO crowd is going to is
[00:15] going to feel the pain. Uh but because
[00:17] if people don't want to buy it at
[00:18] 100,000, they're certainly not going to
[00:20] want to buy it at 200,000. But then
[00:21] there's another angle.
[00:24] What's going on guys? Today we've got an
[00:25] excellent episode with Jordy Visser. He
[00:27] is in studio and I am traveling. But
[00:29] just cuz I'm traveling, we're not going
[00:31] to leave you hanging. So I'm excited
[00:32] about today's conversation. We talk
[00:34] about Israel and Iran and what it means
[00:36] for the stock market, Bitcoin, oil,
[00:38] gold, and much more. We also talk about
[00:40] what's going on with US and China, the
[00:42] AI stories of the week, how the
[00:44] inflation data came in weaker and what
[00:45] that means for your portfolio. And then
[00:47] we talked to Jordy both about what he's
[00:49] excited about and where he sees risks in
[00:51] the market now. And we finish up talking
[00:52] about Bitcoin and a potential short
[00:54] squeeze happening this year. I always
[00:56] enjoy these conversations and this one
[00:58] is no different. So here's my latest
[00:59] conversation with Jordi Visser. All
[01:00] right, Jordy, I thought a great place to
[01:02] start this conversation is uh this week
[01:04] we saw Israel launch a attack on Iran.
[01:07] There's tons of people who say, "Oh,
[01:09] nothing ever happens. They're in
[01:10] shambles." Obviously, this is a very big
[01:13] geopolitical kind of movement. Uh people
[01:15] think this is kind of a regime change
[01:17] and the treatment of some of these
[01:18] countries. How do you think this affects
[01:20] the actual investment portfolios? We saw
[01:23] gold up, we saw oil up, we saw Bitcoin
[01:25] down right after the attack. How do you
[01:27] see this playing out over the next
[01:28] couple of weeks? Well, let's break it
[01:31] down into two parts. The first one is um
[01:34] every single time in history that any
[01:37] country uh or any war breaks out in any
[01:40] side. So, anytime missiles are are
[01:42] fired, anytime there's an invasion, the
[01:45] immediate reaction is what we've seen so
[01:47] far. uh particularly when it involves
[01:49] countries in either the Middle East or
[01:51] Russia, you get the immediate reaction
[01:54] um for those who think Bitcoin should
[01:55] rally on this. Bitcoin at the end of the
[01:57] day is always going to be related to the
[01:59] economy and especially the digital
[02:00] economy. So, it's going to have part
[02:03] being stocks and part being get away
[02:06] from the governments. So, I don't I
[02:08] never see it as a geopolitical hedge and
[02:10] I I just leave it at that for for
[02:12] Bitcoin. I've been involved with markets
[02:14] from a trading perspective and reacting
[02:17] to events like this for 30 years now.
[02:20] That's how long that I had a trading
[02:21] portfolio. That's how long I literally
[02:23] had to make a decision. And I understand
[02:26] younger people who look at this and
[02:28] their brain immediately goes to some
[02:30] dark place. But the reality is these
[02:33] conflicts usually end up being a major
[02:37] event for day one, day two. A week later
[02:40] they become lessened. as long as it's
[02:42] not escalating in a big way. And I'll
[02:44] just use a couple examples.
[02:46] Iran fired missiles into Israel back in
[02:50] December, I believe, of last year.
[02:53] I don't know if people remember that,
[02:55] but they sent two 300 missiles at Israel
[03:00] after Israel assassinated someone inside
[03:03] the country. And so you end up with a
[03:05] situation that people think this is
[03:07] going to be a bigger issue. when Israel
[03:09] in uh in went into Gaza, we ended up in
[03:13] a situation where everyone said if they
[03:16] go if something starts with Hezbollah,
[03:18] then this is going to be a major thing.
[03:20] So I don't want to minimize the fact
[03:22] that we have a Iran who's threatened
[03:25] nukes before and we don't know exactly
[03:27] what they have. But the reality is these
[03:29] things usually kind of flame out. Russia
[03:33] Ukraine has not had an impact on the
[03:34] markets that people believed. Then I'll
[03:36] just mention that in the last 15 years,
[03:37] the highest price in oil was 1 week
[03:40] after Russia invaded Ukraine. So these
[03:44] things normally don't have a longlasting
[03:46] impact. If oil stays at 100 plus for 3
[03:49] months, it'll start to have an impact.
[03:50] But if it just goes up and it stays here
[03:52] for a week and then it falls back down
[03:54] to where it was beforehand, it will have
[03:55] no impact on the global economy
[03:57] whatsoever.
[03:58] I saw somebody say something online
[04:00] yesterday which I'd never heard before
[04:02] and uh I apologize to viewers and
[04:04] listeners because it is somewhat
[04:05] grotesque but I think it is an important
[04:07] uh point. They said that one of the
[04:09] rules on Wall Street is to sell the
[04:11] bombs but buy the body count. And their
[04:15] point was when things are happening it
[04:18] is all about actually people are selling
[04:21] and then all of a sudden once the kind
[04:23] of initial attack is over and people
[04:25] start talking about what is the damage
[04:27] kind of the the retroactive analysis
[04:29] that's when there's then the rally is
[04:31] that generally it sounds like that's
[04:32] similar to what um you've seen kind of
[04:35] throughout your career across these
[04:36] asset classes. Yeah, it's really hard in
[04:39] the moment. And I think again, take it
[04:41] back to what I said in the moment. The
[04:44] day it happens, everyone's freaking out
[04:46] because the anxiety kicks in as to what
[04:48] could happen.
[04:51] For stocks to be impacted, you need to
[04:54] impact the economy or earnings. Plain
[04:55] and simple. You can have a sentiment
[04:57] shift where people worry more about the
[04:59] future, but then as time goes on, we're
[05:01] still going to measure this based on the
[05:03] economy and earnings. And so in the same
[05:06] way that we're worried about the tariffs
[05:08] and I mean it's it's another example of
[05:10] just oh my gosh this is going to crater
[05:13] the economy. We're going to have serious
[05:14] inflation and what you see is the
[05:17] forecasts have been dead wrong on every
[05:18] level of the tariffs and extrapolating
[05:21] this scenario into what it'll mean 3
[05:23] months from now. No one knows. So it's
[05:25] not worth just jumping off a building
[05:26] and going through. Shortterm you're
[05:28] going to see it uh impact the ability
[05:30] for risk takingaking but stock buybacks
[05:33] will not stop. they will continue and if
[05:35] anything they will be there to buy on
[05:36] the dip. Now obviously people will look
[05:40] across the stock market and with Bitcoin
[05:41] and they will say oh are there certain
[05:43] stocks I should be buying? You know I
[05:45] joked last night that uh Palunteer is
[05:47] going to be worth a gazillion dollars.
[05:49] Um there are private companies like
[05:50] Anderil and others that I think people
[05:52] are starting to look at this. But
[05:53] there's a lot of defense stocks uh as
[05:54] well. And now again this is Israel and
[05:56] Iran. The United States is claiming that
[05:58] they were not actually involved. But I
[06:00] do think that people see kind of a a
[06:02] drafting of uh these defense companies.
[06:04] So how do you think about the defense
[06:05] sector in terms of an investment
[06:07] opportunity? And then also maybe as an
[06:08] overlay like Bitcoin you mentioned
[06:10] earlier as like a geopolitical hedge
[06:12] maybe you don't see as much. Um so talk
[06:14] just like what are the actual impacts on
[06:16] individual asset kind of verticals uh
[06:18] when something like this plays out.
[06:20] Again the knee-jerk and defense stocks
[06:21] will be to go higher. Uh I I'm going to
[06:24] go a different angle on this and what I
[06:26] like to do and we talked about this
[06:29] briefly about
[06:31] something like Brazil. The reason I like
[06:33] Brazil is the ven diagram of they
[06:34] benefit from AI through the mineral side
[06:38] meaning rare earth minerals. They have a
[06:39] lot of supply. They benefit from the
[06:41] China US trade uh divorce where Brazil
[06:45] kind of fits in between. It's a big
[06:47] partner of both of them. Uh, I
[06:50] personally think it's about power.
[06:53] Meaning, even if energy doesn't stay up
[06:57] at the levels it is now, it's way off of
[06:59] the lows. So, we've already rallied from
[07:01] say $55 in WTI up to above 73 this
[07:05] morning. Even if it settles in the high
[07:07] 60s, we're at a point at right now where
[07:10] I think the the dominant theme, the vend
[07:13] diagram of investment ideas that people
[07:15] need to have is they need to be focused
[07:17] on power and energy going forward this
[07:20] year. So, we have a potential of a
[07:22] supply shock in the Middle East at the
[07:25] same time as we're going to have a
[07:27] continued demand shock on the AI power
[07:29] needs. And the market has not built this
[07:32] in yet. I'm actually working on a uh a
[07:34] trade idea for next week for 22V that is
[07:37] specifically built around some of the
[07:40] stuff I saw this week from Oracle uh in
[07:43] their earnings announcement. So I think
[07:45] instead of looking of I'm going to get
[07:47] out of stocks because there's a war
[07:49] going on or I'm going to go buy oil
[07:51] because there's something going on. I
[07:53] think the right thing is to look at the
[07:54] ven diagram. What's structurally going
[07:56] to happen no matter what? We're going to
[07:58] run out of power for AI. I want to find
[08:00] energy names that to be long and now
[08:02] you've got this extra thing where I
[08:04] think there'll be a premium on oil going
[08:06] forward. You got two places to go invest
[08:08] in. Talk a little bit about this AI
[08:11] Oracle thing. Larry Ellison talking
[08:13] about this idea of uh insatiable demand.
[08:16] Uh it seems like what was your takeaway?
[08:19] The the Oracle um commentary was
[08:22] incredible. The numbers were were a
[08:24] blowout number and this is not a small
[08:26] company. So you're dealing with a
[08:27] company that is large. It's been large
[08:30] for a long time, but it's been growing
[08:31] and it's, you know, a half a trillion
[08:33] dollars and you get a day where the
[08:36] stock is up 14% on the back of their
[08:38] earnings announcements. Well, Larry
[08:40] Ellison said on the earnings call was
[08:43] that the demand is insatiable and
[08:45] astronomical. And he specifically
[08:47] mentioned that one client asked for all
[08:51] of their capacity anywhere in the world.
[08:55] not and and he basically said it was one
[08:57] customer that just highlights the demand
[09:01] that's happening in AI. You and I have
[09:02] talked about this that I think at the
[09:04] beginning of the year the deepseek fears
[09:07] the cowan reports on Microsoft data
[09:11] centers and all this stuff.
[09:13] What Oracle confirmed is that for the
[09:16] foreseeable future there is demand. They
[09:19] announced their capex numbers would be
[09:21] at least $25 billion next year. So this
[09:23] is not one of the hyperscalers. Remember
[09:25] Oracle is directly involved with
[09:27] Stargate. So you have this kind of thing
[09:30] that anyone who is doubting this side is
[09:34] missing it. And something I didn't
[09:36] mention last week cuz I didn't see this
[09:37] but I listened to an interview with Lex
[09:39] Fridman with Sundar Pchai from Google
[09:42] and he made the comment that the token
[09:45] demand that they had at this point was
[09:49] 50 times higher than a year ago. So
[09:51] tokens are basically the think of it as
[09:53] the power
[09:55] the output or the power that's being
[09:57] used for the demand for AI.
[10:00] And when you go through the chart and
[10:01] you look at it and you can go into X and
[10:04] see he posted the chart. I mean it's a
[10:06] parabolic
[10:08] growth rate. This was before V3. So now
[10:11] that V3 has been released and I've
[10:13] talked about how insatiable this demand
[10:15] will be. This is where it gets into the
[10:17] power situation. you're dealing with
[10:19] tokens which effectively are the AI
[10:21] power demand. They equate to power. Uh I
[10:24] did the calculation. I went into chat
[10:26] GBT and I asked how to equate the
[10:28] numbers they were talking about which I
[10:29] believe was 480 trillion
[10:33] uh tokens and you on an annualized
[10:35] basis. And if you go in and ask what
[10:37] that is, it came out to about a quarter
[10:41] of a percent of all the electricity
[10:43] demand in the United States. So the way
[10:46] that I look at the Oracle thing is
[10:47] anyone who's doubting the demand side of
[10:50] AI is missing it. We have a supply
[10:52] problem. That's going to keep growth
[10:54] going in the US. The race for AI is
[10:57] going to continue to happen. And I just
[10:58] think that people need to start focusing
[11:00] on the power side because that's one of
[11:01] the bottlenecks that's going to start to
[11:03] show up very very soon. When we look at
[11:06] other big stories this week, China and
[11:08] the US trade deal. Um I'll kind of put
[11:10] it in air quotes a little bit because it
[11:12] seems like we agreed to something but
[11:14] haven't yet signed it. It is uh uh
[11:16] contingent on the approval of both
[11:18] President Xi and of uh of Trump. But
[11:21] talk a little bit about you know it's
[11:23] this weird dynamic. We have the AI story
[11:25] going on and it's so clear like how much
[11:27] demand and how quickly this is all
[11:29] going. We have the geopolitical conflict
[11:31] which has so much uncertainty and then
[11:33] you have these things that kind of sit
[11:34] in the middle, right? Where it seems
[11:35] like the USChina relationship is better
[11:37] today than it was two or three weeks
[11:38] ago, but we still do have a degree of
[11:40] uncertainty in like what exactly is
[11:42] going to be that final deal even though
[11:44] details have been released. Today's
[11:46] episode is sponsored by Figure, the
[11:48] largest non-bank home equity lender in
[11:50] the United States with over $15 billion
[11:52] unlocked on their lending platform. They

[12:08] LTVs. Whether you're funding a major
[12:10] purchase like a down payment on a home,
[12:12] investing in new opportunities, or even
[12:14] buying more Bitcoin, Figure makes it
[12:16] straightforward and transparent. You can

[12:27] this product. So, go visit figure.com/p
[12:30] to better understand exactly what
[12:32] they're doing and how these rates work.
[12:34] You can go to figure.com/p
[12:37] today.
[12:39] Yeah, I I mean I've used this analogy
[12:41] before, but we are in the separation
[12:44] period before the divorce of the two
[12:46] countries. uh and the divorce is going
[12:48] to be that neither one of us wants to be
[12:51] dependent on the other's supply chain.
[12:54] So in the case of the US,
[12:57] we're holding off exporting high-end
[13:00] chips to them, which is necessary for
[13:01] AI. On their side, they were holding off
[13:04] rare earth minerals, which is critical
[13:06] for both AI in the US because it's
[13:10] critical for semiconductors,
[13:12] but it's also critical for the military.
[13:14] So, you need these for fighter jets. You
[13:17] need these for drones. You need these
[13:18] for everything. In fact, if you go
[13:20] through a fighter jet and like you can
[13:22] go look it up and see how many different
[13:24] parts of the fighter jet need rare earth
[13:26] minerals. So, that's why I said last
[13:28] week the trade war is over. As far as
[13:30] I'm concerned, uh this is a separation
[13:32] where they have to get along. They're
[13:33] going to mediation. That's what this is.
[13:36] I'm going to keep using the divorce
[13:37] thing. They are literally in the middle
[13:38] of mediation and they're like, "Well,
[13:40] you give me rare earth for 6 months uh
[13:43] and I'll give you chips." Now, that's
[13:44] the one thing that hasn't been announced
[13:46] yet, but behind the scenes, most people
[13:48] believe that there's some kind of an
[13:50] agreement from the US to give them some
[13:53] sort of chips. Uh I believe there is
[13:56] because basically
[13:58] it looks similar to Geneva but it's very
[14:02] clear that we call them we went through
[14:05] this and then we sat down and we're
[14:07] trying to end up in a situation where
[14:08] there's no more fighting and we'll go
[14:10] focus on the other trade deals. But I
[14:11] think the China US thing has come to a
[14:13] stalemate and we're just going to have
[14:15] to agree to export things or maybe
[14:17] little flare-ups along the way. But I
[14:18] don't think this is going to have the
[14:19] impact that people thought it would say
[14:21] 2 weeks ago.
[14:23] And when we get clarity in that, whether
[14:26] it is separation or divorce, um is it
[14:29] just a game where both countries are so
[14:31] dependent on each other that they need
[14:32] to buy time in order to kind of build up
[14:36] the resilience to then be separate? I
[14:38] kind of think of it like, you know, a
[14:39] married couple who says, "Hey, we both
[14:41] got to pat our bank accounts before we
[14:42] actually go through the divorce so that
[14:43] we got enough to, you know, to to eat
[14:45] and get our own places and kind of do
[14:47] all that." Yeah. And I and I think, you
[14:50] know, I'll do this on my weekly video,
[14:52] but what has what has come out in a
[14:55] couple ways this week, Scott Bessant
[14:58] said, "China, we've agreed that we need
[15:01] to focus on the manufacturing side in
[15:04] the US and China needs to focus more on
[15:06] the consumption side." And that is kind
[15:09] of the let's say the top-down system
[15:11] thinkers way of saying that's how we're
[15:14] going to balance this thing out is we
[15:15] can't be too dependent on each other to
[15:18] where we can't just take a pause and
[15:21] then go do other things. So if we're
[15:23] saying and we did say okay we love
[15:26] having Chinese students in the
[15:27] universities here and it was two weeks
[15:29] ago that we were going to ban them. All
[15:31] of these things all lead to the same
[15:32] thing which is China has announced some
[15:35] more things to support the property
[15:36] market. the property market is the key
[15:38] to their consumption story because it's
[15:41] the major part and I think China is
[15:43] going to continue to attempt to help the
[15:44] consumption. On the US side, we're going
[15:46] to continue to focus on building up the
[15:48] manufacturing stuff and getting most of
[15:50] the supply. Rare Earth is a perfect
[15:52] example. Let's get that supply chain
[15:54] working in the US. Let's make the
[15:55] investments that are necessary. So if
[15:57] you ask me for the next 5 years that
[15:59] situation is much better than it was
[16:01] before the tariffs because China is
[16:04] actually trying to they they they need
[16:06] to create stimulus. So there's two
[16:09] aspects of kind of the trade situation.
[16:11] If it's friction, it leads to more
[16:14] nationalist spending and I think in the
[16:16] end that ends up being very good overall
[16:18] for the global economy to make it less
[16:20] dependent on these little shock waves. I
[16:23] I definitely agree with that. In terms
[16:24] of uh some data that we got this week,
[16:26] uh we got the inflation data and I
[16:29] thought it was pretty interesting in
[16:30] that uh the CPI numbers came in lower
[16:32] than expectations. Uh it seemed pretty
[16:34] weak. Um which I think got a lot of
[16:36] people excited. Uh but there still are
[16:38] calls. There was an article in the Wall
[16:40] Street Journal just yesterday that said,
[16:41] "Hey, it's time to, you know, cut
[16:43] rates." The the case for cutting rates
[16:45] is getting uh stronger and stronger. How
[16:47] did you look at the data and how that
[16:49] may impact whether it's rate cuts or
[16:50] other decisions that uh kind of
[16:52] leadership needs to make?
[16:54] Yeah, I I think this month was the one
[16:58] that everyone who's been looking for
[17:00] inflation to go higher, which at the
[17:02] beginning of the year, I did think we'd
[17:04] see inflation go higher, I I think this
[17:06] is the one that people have to start
[17:09] thinking that something different is
[17:11] going on right now. And I and I'll I'll
[17:13] say why this wasn't just first of all,
[17:15] it wasn't one data point. The PPI was
[17:18] lower than expected. And then when you
[17:19] go back the last two months, you've been
[17:21] seeing this happen. This is all while
[17:23] expectations were that tariffs were
[17:25] going to flow through, they did flow
[17:27] through. So if you go through
[17:29] appliances, you go through the household
[17:31] furnishings, the good side, we did see a
[17:34] pickup there. The problem is the core
[17:37] services and everything x shelter it it
[17:40] was weak. 73 economists uh put in their
[17:44] estimates for Bloomberg. This was lower
[17:46] than all 73. When you start getting this
[17:49] type of scenario, that means there's
[17:51] something else going on because that's a
[17:53] lot of economists putting in their
[17:55] forecast and this coming in below. And
[17:57] again, this isn't one. So, I've talked
[17:59] about on here something that I think is
[18:01] is absolutely happening. I think for the
[18:03] bottom 50% in the country, this is
[18:07] becoming
[18:08] a recession
[18:10] in a fear thing. So, we looked at this
[18:13] soft data on the surveys.
[18:16] I think people are really starting to
[18:18] worry about what's happening with
[18:19] artificial intelligence and they're
[18:21] starting to worry that with rates
[18:22] sitting up at these levels that we're
[18:24] going to continue to see pressure on
[18:25] smaller businesses. I do think the Fed
[18:27] is now at a point where the surprise
[18:29] could be we have 65% chance of a rate
[18:32] cut in for in for September. Now the
[18:36] Iran situation if oil sits at higher
[18:38] levels and we see a pass through to
[18:39] gasoline you'll see higher inflation
[18:41] numbers. They'll view it as transitory
[18:43] because they're going to look at the job
[18:44] market and they're going to look at the
[18:45] inflation number. But if their dual
[18:47] mandate is protect against inflation and
[18:51] look at the labor market and claims went
[18:54] higher again this week on the initial
[18:56] jobless claims, it's not a big spike.
[18:58] It's not at a level that's worrisome,
[19:00] but continuing claims continues to go
[19:02] higher. And I've talked repeatedly about
[19:04] all the indications that the labor
[19:05] market is just soft. And in last week's
[19:08] video, I went through and showed that if
[19:10] it wasn't for
[19:13] leisure and hospitality and healthcare,
[19:17] two areas that are basically supported
[19:19] by Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid,
[19:21] government spending, government jobs are
[19:24] now zero over the last 5 months or four
[19:26] months. Uh, no, since yeah, the last 5
[19:29] months. And the rest of it is pretty
[19:32] close to zero. I think the 5-month
[19:33] average is 33,000x those two. So, the
[19:37] job market's weak, inflation's weak. I
[19:39] think the surprise here could be,
[19:40] especially with all of the pressure
[19:42] coming from the White House, JD Vance,
[19:44] Lutnik, Trump, they've all basically
[19:46] publicly come out, chastise pal. Um, I
[19:50] think he's running out of rope at this
[19:51] point, especially if next month we don't
[19:54] get any more, we don't get a jump. I
[19:56] think that'll be the month. So, I do
[19:58] think at this point there'd have to be a
[19:59] bump up in inflation or some big jobs
[20:02] print to stop them cutting in September.
[20:05] So, from that standpoint, does that
[20:08] pretty much freewalk us to all-time high
[20:10] of stocks or do you still have some
[20:12] reservations in terms of uh what that
[20:15] could look like? I I think we're heading
[20:17] to alltime highs unless unless Israel
[20:19] and Iran turns into something that moves
[20:21] oil up to significant levels. uh what
[20:25] Oracle talked about, what I'm starting
[20:28] to see flow through on semiconductors,
[20:31] the demand that I expect to have happen
[20:33] from the buildout. I think people are
[20:36] still way off base on what's going to
[20:38] happen with earnings. I think the profit
[20:39] margins are going to remain at the
[20:42] higher levels. I saw some strategists
[20:44] who I won't call out that were talking
[20:45] that after the PPI number, they're
[20:48] looking at how the the this is showing
[20:50] signs that we're in a recession. The
[20:52] problem for everyone is going to be that
[20:53] artificial intelligence is going to
[20:55] disrupt all of the historical
[20:58] correlations between the economy and
[21:00] profit margins that they've seen. The
[21:02] economy is still absolutely fine. It's
[21:05] just that AI is driving everything good
[21:07] that's going on. It's also forcing
[21:10] stocks higher which helps the wealth
[21:11] effect. But for the bottom 50% who again
[21:14] don't own many assets and are at at risk
[21:18] for jobs both from small businesses that
[21:20] can't compete in this environment and
[21:22] also from you know entry- level jobs for
[21:25] for against artificial intelligence. I
[21:28] think we're in a perma trend here. I do
[21:30] not think this is going to be something
[21:31] that goes away quickly. Uh so I think
[21:33] people have to get used to this dynamic
[21:35] that's a very unique situation in the
[21:37] history of the country. Is there any
[21:39] other data points that you're really
[21:40] paying attention to? You know, one of
[21:42] the things that um I I starting to see
[21:44] now is more and more people are looking
[21:46] at alternative metrics and trying to
[21:48] kind of back into, hey, what's going on?
[21:50] Um, we did see over the week, uh, right
[21:53] before the Iran, uh, Israel situation,
[21:56] there was this Twitter account that
[21:58] tracks the orders to pizza restaurants
[22:01] that are around the Pentagon and they
[22:03] swapped and they tweeted something like,
[22:07] uh, you know, hey, uh, immediate surge
[22:09] in activity. 2 hours, 3 hours later,
[22:12] there was the attack. And so, again, is
[22:14] it a one-off? Is it actually something
[22:16] that you can tell? Who knows? But I just
[22:18] find it fascinating like this obsession
[22:20] with the alternative data that can tell
[22:22] you things. Is there anything else that
[22:23] you pay attention to? Not really. I I
[22:26] honestly um like what you're talking
[22:28] about those things are more interesting
[22:30] to talk about than to actually go
[22:33] through. I I will say this um
[22:37] so I use every LLM
[22:40] for different reasons at this point. So
[22:42] what's happened to me is I don't have a
[22:44] favorite one. I can remember when we
[22:45] were we were talking in Miami. Uh at
[22:48] that point I was kind of migrating
[22:50] towards Perplexity. I'd used chat GPT
[22:53] and now what's happened is I use
[22:55] Perplexity for everything related to
[22:57] finance. It has for the most part taken
[23:00] away now 60% of my Bloomberg usage which
[23:02] is amazing to me. I never thought as
[23:04] someone who's been using a Bloomberg for
[23:05] 30 years that that would happen. Uh but
[23:07] for everyone who's in the finance
[23:08] industry, everyone who's watching this
[23:10] as a hedge fund person, uh perplexity is
[23:12] a phenomenal tool to get real-time
[23:15] information. And so the comments that I
[23:17] made with Larry Ellison, which are into
[23:19] my head, I read that commentary and I do
[23:21] it with all I did it with a Vaga with um
[23:24] uh with Broadcom when uh when they
[23:26] released earnings. Uh I'll do it with
[23:28] Micron coming up. I go in there and I
[23:30] get all of the commentary. I use YouTube
[23:33] to get all of the transcripts on
[23:35] everything that goes through. So instead
[23:36] of picking alternative data, I think
[23:38] what's become easy for all of us that is
[23:41] where I'm spending my time is less on
[23:44] let's say alternative data but it's
[23:46] turning text into data for me and into
[23:50] real-time information where I can
[23:52] consume an enormous amount of detail. So
[23:54] Bloomberg used to be my alternative data
[23:56] source. I'm not using that as much and
[23:59] I'm going directly into Perplexity and
[24:00] I've built so many chat GPT projects. I
[24:03] think I mentioned this last week. I did
[24:05] my first demo for a hedge fund on how to
[24:08] use it real time and how to go through
[24:10] it. And to be fair, you know, they're
[24:13] not allowed, they weren't allowed to use
[24:15] it. And I think that's where alternative
[24:17] data should migrate to. I think people
[24:19] should be turning text into data and
[24:21] doing that. You just need to use your
[24:22] LLM and pick the ones you want to use.
[24:25] It makes so much sense. Um, this may be
[24:28] blasphemous for us to talk about with uh
[24:30] with Bitcoin, but I think it does give
[24:32] us some market data. Ethereum had a uh a
[24:36] quick development this week. Um and I
[24:38] look at it as you know historically in
[24:40] these market cycles uh Bitcoin has run
[24:42] and then at some point there's kind of
[24:44] quoteunquote alt season and people then
[24:46] kind of rotate from Bitcoin further out
[24:48] on the risk curve and then you kind of
[24:50] see the the altcoins run. Um I don't
[24:52] know if that will still persist. It does
[24:55] seem like Bitcoin has kind of sucked the
[24:56] air out of the room and it has become uh
[24:58] the consensus that this is the thing
[25:00] that Wall Street wants. But Ethereum now
[25:02] did break above that 200 day moving
[25:04] average. And so, how do you see the
[25:06] relationship of kind of moves in the
[25:08] Ethereum ecosystem to something like
[25:10] Bitcoin? Today's episode is brought to
[25:12] you by Bitisenship. If you're a
[25:14] Bitcoiner thinking about global mobility
[25:16] and securing a true plan B, listen up.
[25:19] Portugal is one of the most attractive
[25:21] golden visa programs in the world. And
[25:23] Bitisenship has built the ideal pathway
[25:25] to get you there. They're behind the
[25:27] first Bitcoin ecosystem golden visa
[25:29] fund. It's a private equity fund that
[25:31] purchases Bitcoin via a local company
[25:34] that gives you exposure to Bitcoin while
[25:36] qualifying you for the Golden Visa and
[25:38] citizenship in just 5 years. Plus,
[25:41] here's what makes this a no-brainer.
[25:43] Citizenship has the lowest fee structure
[25:45] of any Golden Visa fund in Portugal. And

[26:52] Go check them out today. But Ethereum
[26:54] now did break above that 200 day moving
[26:57] average. And so how do you see the
[26:59] relationship of kind of moves in the
[27:01] Ethereum ecosystem to something like
[27:03] Bitcoin?
[27:04] So I'm going to equate it I I I
[27:06] mentioned this last week that I I really
[27:08] don't think Bitcoin can have the the
[27:11] spike move that I think is going to
[27:13] happen this year. a significantly, you
[27:16] know, higher move in a month than people
[27:18] thought possible. For that to happen,
[27:20] you need Ethereum and Salana to be going
[27:22] higher. For that to be happening, in my
[27:24] opinion, we need to work through all of
[27:27] what appears to be the supply that's out
[27:29] there. I I mentioned and I'll continue
[27:31] to mention this feels a lot to me like
[27:33] the post.com bubble period uh in 200
[27:38] really 2002, 2003, 2004, 2005. And for
[27:42] people that are too young for that, like
[27:44] you, uh, it's a big issue. Meaning,
[27:47] there was an overhang of people that had
[27:49] these companies that had been valued at
[27:52] a billion dollars. And Bill Gurley had
[27:54] an excellent uh, podcast this week on
[27:58] Invest Like the Best with Patrick
[28:00] Shaughnessy. And he went through what he
[28:04] called
[28:05] uh, I think he called it VC unicorn
[28:08] zombies.
[28:10] This equates directly into the crypto
[28:12] space and I think theoretically I think
[28:15] right now Salana and Ethereum are
[28:17] basically unicorn zombies for now. His
[28:20] argument was that these companies have
[28:22] been disrupted. There's been major
[28:24] things. You they were they were in a zer
[28:26] period. Now they're postzer. They've got
[28:28] rates at higher levels. They raised an
[28:30] enormous amount of capital. They haven't
[28:32] taken their marks down. Now you've got
[28:33] the private equity guys that are
[28:35] selling. I think all of this overhang in
[28:37] the zombie unicorns is having an impact
[28:41] on the investment side of crypto in a
[28:43] very similar way. I think the breaking
[28:45] point and I've said this all year and
[28:47] now I think it's going to be like that
[28:48] Sundar Pchai thing. I think we're going
[28:51] to enter a period very quickly of stable
[28:53] coin explosive growth. Not just linear
[28:56] growth. I mean explosive volume growth.
[28:58] They've been growing and you you monitor
[29:00] this. You feel it. This is the point
[29:02] where I think the amount of stories
[29:04] coming out. I have trouble in my videos
[29:07] keeping my my my crypto part as small as
[29:09] I try to keep it, which is about a
[29:11] third. I keep try to keep Tradfy at
[29:13] about a half. Uh AI and Bitcoin at the
[29:15] other half. It's getting harder for the
[29:17] crypto side. And it's really getting
[29:18] harder because the stable coins because
[29:20] even this week, Amazon, Walmart, they're
[29:23] all talking about having their own
[29:24] stable coins. This is becoming a bigger
[29:26] thing. And once the volume start to
[29:28] explode and the traffic's going on, I
[29:31] think people are going to go back to the
[29:32] Ethereums, the Salanas, the Swiss, all
[29:34] the guardrail parts, all of the
[29:36] infrastructure parts once they break
[29:38] out, which I think will happen. That's
[29:40] when I think Bitcoin will go and you'll
[29:41] get to see a turn. But we have to break
[29:42] away in my opinion from the zombie
[29:44] unicorns
[29:46] that um that makes sense. What is the
[29:48] thing that you're most worried about
[29:50] right now in terms of uh kind of the
[29:52] downside? I think that when everyone was
[29:54] bearish, you and I both were pretty
[29:55] bullish. It seems like that played out
[29:56] to our uh in our favor. Uh now I feel
[29:59] like optimism is creeping back in. And
[30:02] so it makes me think, well, maybe there
[30:04] are some things we should be looking at
[30:05] or pointing out where risk could exist
[30:07] that people are kind of blind to. What
[30:08] What are those areas that uh that that
[30:11] you see where that could happen? Well,
[30:13] first of all, the the biggest risk is
[30:15] that we're no longer uh alone in being
[30:18] bullish. So, I learned a long time ago
[30:20] that when everyone's kind of throwing
[30:22] their hands up and going through it, uh
[30:25] that that's where the risk is. Uh I will
[30:27] say I'm going to keep going back to the
[30:28] same thing. I think the power situation
[30:31] for AI is not understood. I really do
[30:34] believe that we'll be talking about
[30:35] electricity prices. We'll be talking
[30:37] about blackouts. We'll be talking about
[30:39] a lot of things that the demand side is
[30:41] just it's really going to be hard when
[30:43] you wake up every day and there's a new
[30:46] story about one of the hyperscalers
[30:47] securing
[30:49] something at constellation energy
[30:51] something at talent energy and the
[30:53] reason I'm doing a trade piece the
[30:55] energy market's not priced properly so
[30:57] even companies like Exxon Chevron people
[31:00] think of them as oil companies they're
[31:02] not oil companies anymore yes they have
[31:03] oil they also have gas they make gas
[31:06] fired plants we need an enormous amount
[31:08] of gas fired plants. So, I don't think
[31:11] investors have fully come to terms with
[31:14] the production side. We need this and I
[31:17] don't think we're going to have enough
[31:18] power. So, I think that's one element of
[31:20] it is that that could cause inflation.
[31:23] It could cause a slowdown in AI. It
[31:25] could be the thing that kind of becomes
[31:26] an issue that shows up. But, I think the
[31:28] sentiment is the bigger thing. And then
[31:30] the two pieces that will eventually be a
[31:33] story, uh, we haven't fixed the fiscal
[31:36] deficit. we still have debt to GDP at
[31:38] the level that we do. Uh I think we're
[31:40] going to have a period where either the
[31:43] dollar andor rates will become a story
[31:45] again in the second half of the year and
[31:47] people start to worry. Other than that
[31:49] uh it's the sentiment and the fact that
[31:50] nobody's worried about anything which is
[31:52] probably the biggest worry that um that
[31:54] makes sense. And in terms of Bitcoin,
[31:56] you previously in past weeks have
[31:58] mentioned this uh short squeeze and it
[32:00] feels like um Bitcoin now is traded uh I
[32:03] think it's over $100,000 for at least 30
[32:06] days be closer than 40 days. Um and so
[32:09] there's kind of this like renewed, you
[32:10] know, enthusiasm there, but do you still
[32:12] see the possibility for some sort of uh
[32:15] short squeeze to to drive the price
[32:16] higher? I I think it's going to happen
[32:18] and I think there'll be a month that it
[32:20] goes on and I think it's going to be a
[32:21] painful I think it's going to be a
[32:23] painful move for a lot of people. Uh the
[32:25] FOMO crowd is going to is going to feel
[32:27] the pain. Uh but because if people don't
[32:30] want to buy it at 100,000, they're
[32:31] certainly not going to want to buy it at
[32:32] 200,000. But then there's another angle.
[32:34] I really do believe in watching this
[32:36] market and seeing how much the
[32:38] volatility has come down. It doesn't get
[32:40] talked about often enough, but 30-day
[32:43] volatility on Bitcoin has dropped way
[32:45] below 40. I heard Paul Tudtor Jones on
[32:48] on Bloomberg this week.
[32:51] He said, you know, you want to be long
[32:52] Bitcoin, you want to be long gold, you
[32:54] want to be long stocks. And I happen to
[32:56] agree with him again. And the reason was
[32:57] he's like, they have to run inflation
[33:00] above interest rates. And he
[33:01] specifically mentioned what Japan is
[33:03] doing. Japan has an inflation problem
[33:04] right now, meaning it's way above
[33:06] interest rates. He's saying that's what
[33:08] the US has made the decision to do,
[33:09] which is run inflation hot. He made this
[33:12] comment though, and I love Paul, but
[33:14] he's wrong.
[33:16] He said V adjusted and he said Bitcoin
[33:19] is five times the V of gold. That's not
[33:22] true anymore. Bitcoin V has migrated
[33:24] down even on every measure it's down to
[33:27] about 40 some odd. Best case scenario
[33:30] with gold you could say three times.
[33:31] Right now gold V is more like 20.
[33:33] Bitcoin V is like 40. So we're at two
[33:35] times. I think this is what's happening
[33:38] is Bitcoin keeps running into these
[33:41] 105,000 it goes sideways. 110,000 it
[33:43] goes sideways. This all says to me that
[33:45] there's a short V position out there
[33:48] that is creating a long gamma position
[33:50] for traders and it gets it pinned at
[33:53] these strikes. I can see the options on
[33:55] Darabit and and think so I think as an
[33:57] old derivatives trader who grew up in
[33:59] this stuff when you have an instrument
[34:00] that trades at a 40 V and it's pinned
[34:02] there and Michael Sailor has been out
[34:04] there and he's selling V, everyone's
[34:06] selling V at some point when you start
[34:08] to get up into these areas and it starts
[34:10] to run away. I just think you're gonna
[34:12] have a squeeze. So, I think we're going
[34:13] to have it this year. And rather than
[34:15] get, you know, people get impatient
[34:16] because they want Bitcoin already be
[34:18] 150,000. Just be patient. When the V
[34:20] squeeze happens, you're going to feel
[34:22] it. I love it. I love it. Um, where can
[34:25] we send people to find you on the
[34:26] internet? My YouTube channel. If you
[34:29] just go in Jordy Viser or Visser Labs,
[34:32] you'll find me there. My Substack, uh,
[34:34] for people that are interested, I did
[34:35] write a Substack this week on trying to
[34:38] help people with AI. um and basically
[34:41] highlighting that the biggest risk for
[34:42] you and your children is that you're not
[34:44] using it every day. And I go through
[34:46] kind of a simple technique on how you
[34:48] can start to get more comfortable with
[34:50] it. You can follow me on X and then for
[34:52] the people on the institutional uh but
[34:54] also we're getting more people that are
[34:56] high net worth individuals in trading. I
[34:58] am putting out trade ideas weekly
[35:00] usually if not every two weeks at uh 22V
[35:03] securities 22V research. You can find me
[35:06] there. Amazing. Well, thank you so much
[35:08] for doing this and we'll do it again in
[35:11] the next week. Thanks, bud.
