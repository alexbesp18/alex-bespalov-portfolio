[00:00] What's going on guys? Today we've got a
[00:01] great conversation with Pina Pompiano.
[00:03] In this conversation we talk about the
[00:05] Circle IPO. What's going on with
[00:06] Bitcoin? Are crypto companies the
[00:08] hottest thing on Wall Street? What it
[00:10] means for your portfolio? And then we
[00:11] talk about what's going on with the LA
[00:13] riots. Why actually it is more related
[00:16] to the economics and monetary debasement
[00:18] than you may think. And then what are
[00:19] the potential solutions? Let's stop
[00:21] complaining about what's going on and
[00:22] talk about how we could actually solve
[00:23] some of this stuff. And lastly, we
[00:25] finish up with Invest America. The idea
[00:27] to give $1,000 to every kid in America
[00:29] to help them participate in the stock
[00:31] market and in capitalism. I love it.
[00:33] Let's get it done as a country. Here's
[00:35] my latest conversation with Paulina
[00:37] Pompiano. All right, P. What's our first
[00:38] topic? The people want to get paid. I
[00:42] think stable coin issuer Circle launched
[00:45] its IPO a few days ago and it has been
[00:47] one of the most successful IPOs in
[00:49] recent history with shares 25x overs
[00:52] subscribed and the company raising $1
[00:53] billion $1 billion which is more than
[00:57] double expectations. What do we think
[00:59] about this? I don't think that the overs
[01:00] subscription in the IPO is really the uh
[01:03] the big focus. I think it's the
[01:04] performance of the stock after it got
[01:05] public. It's gone up uh significantly
[01:08] like I think 400% or something like
[01:10] that. Um, what I will say is, uh,
[01:13] there's a couple things here that people
[01:14] don't want to talk about, but let's talk
[01:15] about it. First is the investment
[01:17] bankers pricing the stock real low so
[01:20] that their clients get a big pop. Bill
[01:22] Gurley, many other people have been
[01:23] talking for a long time. There's a very
[01:25] weird incentives. The company obviously
[01:26] wants to raise as much money as possible
[01:28] at the lowest dilution possible. So,
[01:29] they want a high valuation, but the
[01:32] bankers and the clients, they lowest
[01:34] valuation. So, there is some uh kind of
[01:36] thing there. That's not new. It's not
[01:38] the banker's fault. It's not the
[01:39] investor's fault. It's not the company's
[01:40] fault. It's just that is something that
[01:41] we all know about. Second thing is uh
[01:44] everyone sees the circle IPO performance
[01:46] and they're like, "Oh my god, crypto's
[01:48] hot again." Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa,
[01:49] whoa. Slow down there, fella. Because I
[01:53] actually think that this is more about
[01:54] stable coins being hot, not broader
[01:56] crypto. And if you think about there's a
[01:58] lot of crypto businesses that would like
[01:59] to be public, if they came public, I
[02:01] don't think that you would get the same
[02:02] reaction that you're getting for Circle.
[02:04] So part of this is stable coins are hot.
[02:06] Not all of broader crypto. Will there be
[02:08] other sectors? of course, but I think
[02:10] stable coins are the big one. On top of
[02:12] that, you have more eyes now looking at,
[02:15] okay, well, how is Circle performing?
[02:17] Man, Tether, which is the other large
[02:19] stable coin uh issuer, they must be
[02:22] worth a gazillion dollars cuz they're
[02:23] even bigger. They did $13 billion in
[02:25] profit. So, I think we're starting to
[02:26] get some marks from the public market
[02:28] about uh this industry. Uh it's very
[02:30] good, but I just worry, do not
[02:33] extrapolate out. Circle was good. Here
[02:35] comes the next crypto IPO. It's going to
[02:36] be amazing. Um and then I think the last
[02:38] thing is uh when you look at these
[02:40] businesses, one of the things that is
[02:42] happening which I keep saying over and
[02:44] over again is everything is converging
[02:45] into finance. So you have exchanges like
[02:48] Robin Hood, fast growing segment is
[02:50] crypto. You have Kraken, private crypto
[02:51] exchange that's now going to offer US
[02:53] public equities. That is a convergence
[02:55] of crypto and traditional finance all
[02:57] coming together. You now have circle
[02:59] which is using US dollars in this new
[03:02] format of tokenization. You put those
[03:04] together, bam, you've got a successful
[03:06] IPO. And so I just think that everyone
[03:08] is so focused on the traditional world
[03:09] and the crypto world. It's all going to
[03:11] be one big thing. You're not even going
[03:12] to worry about which rails is it on. I
[03:14] just want to know does it solve a
[03:16] problem? Is it a product or service that
[03:17] people want? If the answer is yes and it
[03:19] makes money, then people are going to
[03:20] want it from an investor base. Yes. And
[03:22] Gemini has also filed for an IPO. Go
[03:25] Gemini. And uh why go Gemini? I I just
[03:29] think that uh obviously Coinbase has
[03:31] done a fantastic job as kind of the
[03:33] premier brand in the United States. Uh
[03:35] they have onboarded I think over 100
[03:37] million people as users. Uh they were
[03:39] there in 2012. Did a fantastic job of
[03:41] really getting a lot of people into
[03:42] Bitcoin early on. Um but Cameron and
[03:45] Tyler Winklevoss and Gemini I think are
[03:46] kind of like unsung heroes as part of
[03:48] the story as well. Uh they have
[03:50] consistently said you know there needs
[03:52] to be regulation, there needs to be
[03:53] rules. They really spent a lot of time
[03:55] doing that. Um and I think that Cameron
[03:56] and Tyler in a very unique way uh they
[03:59] drove a lot of interest in Bitcoin uh
[04:02] kind of indirectly. You know, people
[04:03] forget that like outside of the crypto
[04:05] world, Cameron and Tyler are very well
[04:07] known. Uh the social network movie,
[04:09] right? Kind of that whole story. And so
[04:11] their early bet on Bitcoin, they bought
[04:13] 11 million of Bitcoin at a very low uh
[04:15] cost. It's worth billions of dollars
[04:17] today. Probably one of the best
[04:18] investments that people have had in a
[04:20] long time. But I do think that they were
[04:22] able to pull a lot of like people who
[04:23] wouldn't have been interested in
[04:24] Bitcoin. Hey, why are these guys
[04:26] interested in this thing? What what's
[04:27] going on here? Then obviously they have
[04:28] Gemini and they're now launching things
[04:29] like the Gemini credit card and stuff
[04:31] like that. So, I just think that uh
[04:33] Gemini usually is uh not included in the
[04:37] conversation with the Coinbases, the
[04:38] Binances, whatever. Uh but I think
[04:40] they're a very important part of the
[04:41] ecosystem. I think they've been a great
[04:43] player. Uh we've worked with them for a
[04:45] long time uh across a variety of
[04:46] different things, events we've done or
[04:48] or you know, podcasts, stuff like that.
[04:50] Uh but I do think that it's kind of like
[04:52] um these people genuinely believe in the
[04:54] industry. They believe in the assets. Uh
[04:55] they're trying to figure out what are
[04:56] the products and services that users
[04:58] want. Um, and so I want to see anyone in
[05:00] the industry who does those things be
[05:02] successful. Uh, and so far it seems like
[05:04] Gemini, you know, they're going to do
[05:05] this IPO. Uh, I'd love to see them have,
[05:07] you know, the same result as Circle. Is
[05:09] it fair to say that Wall Street now
[05:11] loves Bitcoin? Like that's the hot new
[05:14] thing. Well, a couple months ago, I
[05:16] think we talked about the fact that Wall
[05:17] Street doesn't have any love for
[05:20] anything unless it can make money. So
[05:22] like, Wall Street is loyal to money. And
[05:25] so what Bitcoin and the broader crypto
[05:27] industry represents is the ability for
[05:29] them to get new clients, new assets
[05:31] under management, and new revenue. And
[05:33] if you can do those three things for
[05:34] Wall Street, they'll love you until they
[05:37] find, you know, a new mistress to go and
[05:38] find and hang out with. And so I think
[05:40] that's really what you're seeing right
[05:41] now is just like Bitcoin and crypto is
[05:43] this new shiny thing that showed up.
[05:45] They saw the launch of the Bitcoin ETFs.
[05:47] That was really the first big Wall
[05:48] Street product. grand slam for the Black
[05:51] Rocks, the Fidelities, and you know, uh,
[05:53] Vanax, etc., the incumbents. Uh, and now
[05:55] you're starting to see it trickle down.
[05:57] The bankers, they're making a killing.
[05:59] They're raising money for the Bitcoin
[06:00] treasury companies. They're raising
[06:01] money for Circle. They're taking
[06:03] companies public. They're doing M&A.
[06:04] Like, they love this stuff. And so,
[06:06] anytime you have a new industry with
[06:08] lots of activity, activity is how Wall
[06:10] Street makes money. If there's a lot of
[06:12] turnover in trading, if there's a lot of
[06:13] turnover in fundraising, if there's a
[06:15] lot of turnover in M&A, like that is how
[06:17] Wall Street makes money. They need
[06:18] volume. they need uh volatility and
[06:21] there's nothing that has more volume and
[06:23] volatility than Bitcoin and crypto uh
[06:24] and kind of the surrounding businesses.
[06:26] And so I think that's why yeah sure Wall
[06:27] Street loves them love them till they
[06:29] don't but right now this industry is
[06:32] providing a lot of paychecks to a lot of
[06:34] people across Wall Street. And so until
[06:36] that stops you're going to see you know
[06:38] every single Wall Street executive they
[06:40] go yeah I love Bitcoin I love crypto I
[06:42] love this. I love that. Uh but guess
[06:43] what? They also love AI. They also love
[06:45] you know all these other industries that
[06:46] are providing this as well. It just
[06:48] happens to be that maybe we're the best
[06:49] at marketing what's going on because of
[06:51] the online kind of engagement of people
[06:53] in the Bitcoin and crypto industry. And
[06:55] speaking of Bitcoin, uh the price is
[06:58] currently tracking with the global M2
[06:59] money supply. And you wrote in your
[07:01] newsletter, there will be more money
[07:03] printing, a larger national debt, and
[07:05] liquid assets are going to be much
[07:07] higher. Stocks will appreciate in price,
[07:09] gold will appreciate in price, and
[07:11] Bitcoin will likely be the biggest
[07:12] winner out of every asset. Are we going
[07:15] to continue to see markets go higher in
[07:18] the coming months? Book it. Book it.
[07:22] Take a ticket to the moon. That's where
[07:23] that's where all this is going, right?
[07:25] Because if you think about what's
[07:27] happening here is uh we just went
[07:29] through the single greatest like true
[07:33] faith effort to cut government spending
[07:35] we will see in our lifetime. We took the
[07:37] world's greatest entrepreneur who is
[07:40] famous for slashing costs, creating
[07:42] efficiencies, you know, uh going in and
[07:44] right sizing shitty businesses, just
[07:47] call them what they are.
[07:49] And he was within 120 days, 130 days,
[07:53] I'm out of here.
[07:55] That's crazy. Crazy. Now, it's not his
[07:58] fault. If you go and you look like I I
[08:00] have a lot of friends who went and
[08:01] worked these organizations and stuff.
[08:02] There's a lot of crazy stuff that was
[08:04] going on that will be stories told later
[08:06] on, but one example is they would go in
[08:09] and they'd be like, "Okay, let's just
[08:10] say there's a department. It has 2,000
[08:13] people and they're like, I think this
[08:14] department can run with 50 people."
[08:16] We're not talking about like 2,000 to,
[08:17] you know, 1,900, like 2,000 to 50.
[08:21] They can't fire anybody. So, if you
[08:23] can't fire people, then obviously you
[08:26] don't have the best people, right?
[08:27] Because what ends up happening is people
[08:28] just they whatever they can do to get
[08:29] the job, then they can't leave. It's
[08:31] kind of like people don't really talk
[08:32] about it. You ever watched uh I think
[08:34] it's uh called Super Superman or
[08:36] something like that. It's the uh
[08:37] documentary about the New York City
[08:39] teachers. Oh yeah. Yeah. And the rubber
[08:41] rooms. Superman. I have no You can't
[08:43] fire a teacher in some of these uh
[08:46] jurisdictions. And so again, if you
[08:49] can't get rid of the people who are not
[08:51] good at their job and bring in people
[08:52] who are good at their job, what do you
[08:54] get? You naturally you have a reversion
[08:56] to the mean. That's not good. That's not
[08:58] what we need. And so I think that that
[09:00] that is a big part of the story as well
[09:02] is like there were a lot of things that
[09:03] they should have done and they wanted to
[09:05] do but they weren't allowed to do it.
[09:07] Now for some reason there there's laws
[09:08] in place that didn't let them do it. Uh
[09:10] and maybe some of those laws are there
[09:12] for good reason, some of them aren't.
[09:13] But I think that's really the the going
[09:15] to be the story there. So going to
[09:17] finance, they're going to print money
[09:18] and they going to print as much money as
[09:20] they possibly need. It is a guarantee
[09:23] now. We took our best shot. I was
[09:25] excited. I thought we had a shot. We
[09:26] ain't got no shot. It's over. Lyn Alden
[09:28] says it best. No stopping this train.
[09:30] They're going to continue to print
[09:31] money. National debt's going up, which
[09:33] means asset prices are going up, dollars
[09:34] are going down. So this, you know,
[09:37] cutting spending, balancing the budget,
[09:40] it's kind of a fever dream. Neither the
[09:42] Republicans nor the Democrats can do it.
[09:46] They can't do it. Even if they want to
[09:47] do it, they can't do it. It's over. Game
[09:49] over. Wave the white flag. The national
[09:51] debt won. The national debt's going to
[09:52] the sky, which means get out of cash cuz
[09:56] that's going to get debased. and get
[09:58] into some sort of investment. I don't
[10:00] even care what investment, but you got
[10:01] to get out of cash. Are you Are you
[10:03] disappointed personally? Because I know
[10:04] you were big on balancing that budget.
[10:07] Well, I Yes, of course. I I think that
[10:09] the uh budget should be balanced. Of
[10:11] course, I'm disappointed, right? Like
[10:12] that was the best faith effort that we
[10:14] had to go and do it. And the fact that
[10:15] it's not going to happen, it's
[10:16] incredibly disappointing. It's
[10:18] depressing. It is uh sad. We got kids. I
[10:22] got friends that got kids. Guess who's
[10:24] going to bear the burden of all this
[10:25] stuff? them
[10:28] 30 years from now. Hopefully, I'm still
[10:30] here, but they're not going to be gone
[10:34] in 30 years or 40 years. This is a
[10:36] one-way train now. And so, how many
[10:39] countries used to be
[10:42] living large, in charge, greatest
[10:44] economy, strongest currency, etc. And
[10:46] they ain't anymore. You've been to
[10:48] Europe. You're from Europe. That place
[10:51] is a museum compared to America. We got
[10:54] innovation. We got flying cars,
[10:56] literally. We now have air taxis. We got
[10:58] rockets. We got DNA sequencing. We got
[11:01] self-driving cars. We got guns. They all
[11:04] need our I mean, they're begging us to
[11:05] give them our weapons, right? All this
[11:07] stuff that we got going on here. We're
[11:09] the kings of the world.
[11:12] But you know how kingdoms fall
[11:16] that currency. And guess what we're
[11:18] doing? We're just a bunch of humans on
[11:21] this planet who didn't learn from
[11:23] thousands of years of humans before us.
[11:25] We're going and we're debasing our
[11:27] currency which ultimately erodess away
[11:30] both the purchasing power of a large
[11:32] portion of the population. It is now 62%
[11:34] of Americans have uh stocks 62%. Great
[11:39] 38% don't. On top of that, if you go and
[11:42] you look, guess who owns the stocks?
[11:44] wealthy people, well-educated people,
[11:47] and disproportionately white people over
[11:49] anyone else. I don't care about all the
[11:51] race stuff. I'm just telling you what
[11:52] the data says. When you look at that,
[11:54] you say to yourself, "Okay, well then
[11:56] how do we go and we get other people to
[11:59] have exposure to the American stock
[12:00] market?" Because if they don't, 38% of
[12:04] Americans got no investments. They're
[12:06] getting their butts kicked financially
[12:08] because we're debasing the currency. And
[12:09] it's not at 2%, which is what they want
[12:11] to tell us. That's not the real number.
[12:13] truly over 5% closer to 8%. So if you
[12:16] say to yourself, hold on a second here.
[12:19] This only ends one way, which is unrest.
[12:23] You think that there's no connection
[12:25] between the LA riots that are going on
[12:27] right now and what's going on in terms
[12:30] of uh the economy? Stop it. Stop it.
[12:34] This is how you get volatility in a
[12:37] society. It's happening across the
[12:38] world. It's not a US-centric thing. It's
[12:40] happening all around the world. But what
[12:42] you are doing is you are creating a
[12:44] bifurcated society. How is it possible
[12:46] that some people right now are like,
[12:49] "I'm killing it. I'm getting richer than
[12:51] I ever thought." And at the same time,
[12:53] you got other people in the same
[12:54] country, sometimes in the same city,
[12:56] maybe on the same block, saying, "I
[12:59] can't get ahead. I'm only falling
[13:00] further and further behind." It's true.
[13:02] That's crazy. And it all comes back to
[13:05] it's a financial education thing. One
[13:07] group understands own financial assets.
[13:09] The other group was told save and get to
[13:11] some sort of economic freedom. Well,
[13:13] guess what? Only one of those groups is
[13:14] right. And so, if you continue to debase
[13:16] the currency, you should expect to
[13:18] continue to see unrest
[13:20] and all this pent up anger and uh u
[13:24] frustration. I'm not condoning it. You
[13:27] want to drive around a uh a burning car
[13:30] on a motorcycle with a Mexican flag?
[13:32] Hey, man, this is America. I know
[13:34] exactly what's going to happen, right?
[13:35] You ain't going to be doing that very
[13:36] long. But what I also understand is you
[13:40] can be empathetic to people's plight,
[13:42] but also you can be critical of the way
[13:44] that they express it. And that's the
[13:47] difficulty of a lot of this stuff. It's
[13:48] super complex. Yeah. But I think when
[13:51] there's a lot of pentup anger, it kind
[13:54] of like boils over. It's 100%. But by
[13:56] the way, I look, this sounds crazy,
[13:59] right? But again, how many people online
[14:03] are able to balance two ideas in their
[14:05] head to say, "I understand why these
[14:09] people in their position, given the
[14:11] situation that they're in, why they feel
[14:13] the way they feel." Right? Think about
[14:17] is there any right way to go about it? I
[14:18] I one thing that Anthony always says um
[14:21] like at home when we're talking about
[14:24] the news is you often say about someone
[14:28] that I'm surprised you agree with.
[14:31] You'll say they're right about what
[14:33] they're saying about the message, but
[14:36] they're going about communicating it
[14:39] wrong. T take take what's going on in LA
[14:42] right now. Here, let me let me paint a
[14:43] picture for you. Today's episode is
[14:45] brought to you by Maple, the go-to place
[14:47] for onchain asset management. There
[14:49] aren't many teams in crypto who manage
[14:50] real money the right way, but Maple
[14:52] does. Maple now manages over a billion
[14:54] dollars, combining serious finance
[14:56] experience with DeFi innovation. I use
[14:58] Maple because they make it simple to
[15:00] earn real yield. Whether that's
[15:01] allocating stable coins for overcalized

[15:19] Go check them out today. Take take
[15:21] what's going on in LA right now. Hey,
[15:23] let me let me paint a picture for you.
[15:25] You're a child. You were born here in
[15:28] the United States. Or maybe you weren't
[15:30] born in the United States. So, all kinds
[15:31] of complexity, right? But just use a
[15:32] simple example. Let's just say that uh
[15:34] you were not born in the United States,
[15:35] but you were brought here when you were
[15:36] very young. Your parents entered the
[15:38] country illegally. You never became a
[15:40] citizen. You have lived here for maybe
[15:43] you're 20 years old. You've lived here
[15:45] for 15 years of your life. You all you
[15:47] know is growing up in America. You
[15:50] probably feel some sort of tension
[15:53] between whether you came from let's say
[15:56] Mexico and I'm Mexican. I'm proud of my
[15:59] Mexican heritage. That's where I was
[16:00] born. That's where my family's from,
[16:02] etc. But also I enjoy the benefits of
[16:05] America. But you don't have a piece of
[16:07] paper that says you're an American
[16:08] citizen.
[16:10] There is a large group of people in this
[16:11] country who say you are here illegally.
[16:13] And they're right. You are here
[16:14] illegally. Your parents broke the law
[16:16] and they came here. The person who grew
[16:19] up here though, even if they weren't
[16:21] born here, what do they know? All they
[16:22] know is the American experience, right?
[16:24] They feel like this is home. And so you
[16:27] have to be able to understand both sides
[16:29] of that and say they're both right. So
[16:32] rather than go into the streets, right,
[16:35] and attack police officers, and I mean
[16:38] some of the videos are insane, but this
[16:41] happened in 2020. We've seen it happen.
[16:43] Listen, we can see it happen over and
[16:45] over again. Every single time I see it,
[16:46] it's insane. I don't know if you saw the
[16:48] video of all the police cars underneath
[16:49] the bridge and they were all stopped and
[16:50] had been abandoned by the police because
[16:52] they were having rocks thrown at them.
[16:55] That's crazy town stuff, right? But
[16:57] here's the thing is the actual solution
[17:01] to the problem is that America needs to
[17:04] figure out how do we get a more
[17:06] streamlined uh legal immigration process
[17:11] cuz there's a lot of people who they
[17:12] would like to come here and go through
[17:14] the vetting and do it legally and all
[17:15] this kind of stuff but if they're told
[17:16] hey you can't come for seven years right
[17:20] well guess what there's a lot of guys
[17:21] who say I ain't waiting seven years I'm
[17:23] just going to go walk across the border
[17:26] and So it comes back to this whole thing
[17:27] of like by the way that's illegal.
[17:29] That's breaking the law. You're taking a
[17:31] risk in doing that. So if you go and you
[17:33] balance this out, you say to yourself,
[17:35] uh both things can be true, but the
[17:38] solution is not what the people who are
[17:42] going through the plight, they're not
[17:44] going to accomplish the solution they
[17:45] want by taking the methods that they
[17:47] are. And so look at the response.
[17:49] There's a lot of people across the
[17:50] country who are saying if you are
[17:52] burning cars, if you are attacking
[17:54] police officer, if you're doing all this
[17:56] stuff, you now went from somebody who is
[17:58] trying to be a productive uh part of
[18:00] American society to now you are doing
[18:02] the things that American citizens don't
[18:04] want in their cities. And so it's this
[18:06] very very difficult situation, but I
[18:08] attribute it back to you have a
[18:11] bureaucratic government that has not
[18:13] been focused on one securing the border
[18:15] nor creating legal immigration pass. Let
[18:17] me just tell you, even if you're legally
[18:20] here through the immigration process,
[18:21] the bureaucracy is insane and it takes
[18:23] forever and it is difficult and painful
[18:26] for the person trying to do the right
[18:28] thing. 100%. I can understand
[18:31] how it's it's kind of like you know it's
[18:34] this weird thing where um there there's
[18:36] all these uh like uh studies or game
[18:39] theories or or you know type things that
[18:41] happen and I forget one of them I read a
[18:42] long time ago and I thought it was this
[18:44] fascinating thing of uh there's like a
[18:45] plane it crashes in the jungle uh at
[18:47] what point do you start eating the other
[18:49] humans go right but the whole idea was
[18:52] like uh there's a bunch of decisions
[18:55] right at some point you say like hey we
[18:56] don't have access to food then it
[18:58] there's like a uh moral, ethical, and
[19:01] like a you know reality like who do you
[19:03] eat first? It all plays into it,
[19:05] especially, right? And everyone's like,
[19:06] "Oh my god, I could never do that." And
[19:08] then you're like, "Dude, if you haven't
[19:09] eaten in 40 days and you're gonna die,
[19:13] right?" I mean, it gets kind of crazy.
[19:14] And so, like, I also think that another
[19:16] thing that we're watching play out here
[19:18] is um people are performing for social
[19:20] media and it's actually one of the most
[19:22] dangerous parts of society. And not just
[19:23] that, like I was having a conversation
[19:25] earlier with someone who was like, I
[19:27] can't believe that some of these people
[19:28] are doing this knowing that they're
[19:30] sharing where they work. They're showing
[19:32] their faces. They're on camera. And and
[19:34] it's very important. I mean, if you've
[19:35] taken one sociology class or read one
[19:38] sociology book, you know that like mob
[19:40] mentality, it dehumanizes you and you
[19:42] kind of become part of this whole thing.
[19:44] You're not thinking about I am an
[19:46] individual with a job with whatever. you
[19:50] you're thinking, I'm part of this big
[19:52] movement and I'm gonna do whatever it
[19:54] takes and I don't care. You think about
[19:56] the consequences later, which is why I
[19:58] think I'm scared of mobs in general. But
[20:01] um but it it does and you also kind of
[20:03] it dehumanizes the other party which is
[20:06] why you're seeing such violence with
[20:07] such little remorse or I don't know if
[20:11] you saw uh there's a YouTuber who walked
[20:13] up on the uh Las Vegas strip and he shot
[20:17] another YouTuber that he'd been beefing
[20:19] with online. And by the way, when I say
[20:21] YouTuber, I'm talking about I saw a
[20:23] video clip online. The dude had 1500
[20:25] views. Hey, I'm not judging. But you
[20:28] killed somebody over 1500 view videos,
[20:30] right? And what happened was like the
[20:33] YouTuber who got killed was like I'm in
[20:35] Las Vegas or something and the guy was
[20:36] like looking for him like recording like
[20:38] I'm looking for you. You come to my town
[20:39] blah blah whatever. But what does that
[20:40] have to do with any because he's
[20:42] performing for social media, right? Like
[20:44] the whole thing was he they were like
[20:46] concocting this like uh uh beef with
[20:49] each other and it was all this
[20:51] performative thing. Guy's getting
[20:52] thousand views on the video. Imagine
[20:54] killing somebody over that. Go to jail
[20:55] for the rest of your life. So you then
[20:56] extrapolate that out. Say if people are
[20:57] willing to do that, of course they're
[20:59] willing to throw rocks. Of course
[21:00] they're willing to do this crazy stuff,
[21:01] get the cool photo holding the flag,
[21:03] stand on top of the burning way or
[21:05] whatever, right? Of course, the whole
[21:06] generation that's growing up with that
[21:08] is part of it. But I do think that there
[21:10] is a solution.
[21:12] You have to have the iron fist of
[21:15] enforcing the laws with the empathy of
[21:18] providing solutions. And it is an
[21:20] incredibly difficult line to thread, but
[21:23] you have to be able to do both. Do we
[21:25] think we have leadership that can do
[21:27] that? I I don't think that any of the
[21:30] leaders involved in this stuff is trying
[21:33] to do both. I think that you have the
[21:37] left-leaning California leadership that
[21:40] literally would watch the city burn as
[21:43] long as they didn't offend anyone and
[21:44] they say we are going to be as
[21:46] empathetic as possible cuz that's how
[21:48] you get that in society. Can you imagine
[21:50] in New York City people doing that? Why
[21:53] doesn't it happen in New York? Oh, I
[21:55] guess it did. Well, in 2020, in 2020,
[21:57] there's two specific incidents that I
[21:59] remember. There was uh a Molotov
[22:02] cocktail thrown into a police car,
[22:05] right? And they were lawyers. They were
[22:06] literally professionals mentality. I'm
[22:08] telling you, they ended up getting
[22:09] arrested. They got in a lot of trouble.
[22:10] The second one is I think I remember
[22:11] showing you there was a video uh I'll
[22:14] never ever ever forget this in Union
[22:17] Square on Park Avenue right at the
[22:20] intersection on the northeast corner. Oh
[22:22] my god. I'll never forget this. And we
[22:25] had protesters
[22:28] squared up with the police officers. He
[22:31] showed me and I remember saying to
[22:32] myself, you know what? I got respect for
[22:34] those police officers. They could have
[22:35] shot those people. They could have beat
[22:37] them with their baton. They could have
[22:39] done a bunch of stuff. By the way, I
[22:40] wouldn't necessarily agree with it, but
[22:41] I'm just saying that within their
[22:42] training, if you're getting beat and you
[22:45] think that you're actually in danger,
[22:46] you got a lot of things that you can do
[22:48] and be covered with the letter of law.
[22:50] These cops didn't do that. They kept
[22:51] their gun in their holster. They kept a
[22:53] baton right there and they squared up,
[22:54] too, and they said, "We're going to
[22:55] scrap right here on Park Avenue." So, it
[22:58] happens. But I remember one or two weeks
[23:01] later there was this huge march from
[23:04] Brooklyn and they went over the Brooklyn
[23:06] Bridge and they were trying to get to
[23:07] Manhattan and the cops met them at the
[23:10] base of the Brooklyn Bridge and they
[23:12] said you ain't coming into Manhattan and
[23:14] they stopped them there and they
[23:15] wouldn't let anyone get into Manhattan.
[23:17] And so that goes back to it things can
[23:20] happen on a one-off basis. There was
[23:22] looting. There was all kinds of crazy
[23:23] stuff in New York. But very quickly that
[23:25] stuff got shut down because it went to
[23:27] hey we got to have an iron fist on the
[23:29] crime and then I don't know if there was
[23:32] ever empathy frankly right I think what
[23:34] you're saying I think there was I think
[23:35] I think there was a lot of like protests
[23:38] and marches that kept going on I don't
[23:40] think those were shut down no no but
[23:42] that's not but that people aren't
[23:44] they're not burning stuff they're not
[23:45] but I'm saying the empathy was there
[23:47] like there's not you know I I meant more
[23:49] so like what are the changes that the
[23:50] the people wanted right I don't know if
[23:52] that stuff ever happened but the the The
[23:53] reason I explain it this way is um again
[23:56] it goes back to economics which people
[23:59] they don't want to say this but if
[24:02] people feel economic pain and they lose
[24:04] hope they are much more likely to go
[24:06] into the streets and into the streets
[24:07] can mean different things in different
[24:08] geographies but what we are watching
[24:10] right now happen in LA has way more to
[24:13] do with economics than anyone wants to
[24:15] uh admit and so you have a bunch of
[24:17] people who feel like hey I'm just here
[24:19] trying to work I'm just here trying to
[24:21] make a living for my family Right. I
[24:23] don't want to be involved in some
[24:25] geopolitical thing. I don't want to be
[24:26] involved in some political thing. I'm
[24:27] just trying to go to do my job.
[24:30] But you have a
[24:32] government that is saying you broke the
[24:34] law. Both things can be true. And so I
[24:36] just think that again goes back to the
[24:37] point of when I see a lot of these
[24:38] stories, I try to say to myself, if I
[24:40] was in this person or this person or
[24:43] this person's spot,
[24:45] how do I understand what they think? How
[24:47] do I understand their perspective? If
[24:48] you can do that going around a topic,
[24:51] usually you can actually say to
[24:53] yourself, most of the people involved
[24:55] here, there's a degree of truth in what
[24:58] they're saying. It's just that they're
[24:59] coming at it from different angles. And
[25:02] so what I don't like is we basically
[25:05] have like a a pissing contest between
[25:07] Nome and Trump, but which is which
[25:11] happens every time. Well, but again, it
[25:14] goes back to I think Nome is just
[25:16] performing. He's out here tweeting all
[25:18] kinds of crazy stuff, whatever. He's
[25:19] just looking for retweets. Guy wants to
[25:21] be the president. That's fine. Go be the
[25:22] president. Uh we'll see if you can uh
[25:24] win. Um but
[25:27] I don't see a lot of him talking about
[25:30] stop looting, stop attacking law
[25:32] enforcement officers, all that kind of
[25:34] stuff. So it goes back to this thing of
[25:36] leadership matters and what you condone
[25:40] implicitly or explicitly is ultimately
[25:42] what the people are going to do. So,
[25:45] what do you think is the solution here
[25:46] to say, "Hey, we're going to uphold the
[25:49] law, but here are some of the changes
[25:52] that we will make or what how do you
[25:55] Well, the first thing is uh you just
[25:58] have to have a zero tolerance policy. If
[26:00] you attack a police officer, you are
[26:02] going to be punished to the full extent
[26:04] of the law. Period. Today's episode is

[27:25] today. If you attack a police officer,
[27:28] you are going to be punished to the full
[27:29] extent of the law. Period. Like there's
[27:33] no ifs, ands, buts, may this, that, like
[27:37] done. Then if you destroy other people's
[27:41] property, whether it's the government,
[27:43] other citizens, private businesses, any
[27:45] of that stuff, we will punish you to the
[27:47] full extent of the law. Done. No ifands,
[27:50] buts, anything. By the way, if you want
[27:53] to come out into the street and protest
[27:55] something, that's as American as it
[27:56] comes. You should be allowed to do that,
[27:58] and you should make your voice heard.
[28:00] But there's a fine line between your
[28:03] protesting and free speech and
[28:05] exhibiting distaste or uh frustration
[28:07] with something and burning cars or
[28:10] breaking into people's private business
[28:12] or assaulting police officers. And so I
[28:14] think that's one big thing is again iron
[28:17] fist on enforcing the rules but having
[28:18] empathy for humans. The second thing is
[28:21] that you need to go and look at this
[28:24] from a root cause standpoint. We need
[28:26] leg legal immigration that is efficient,
[28:28] that can successfully vet people to make
[28:30] sure they're not a threat, that can
[28:32] actually understand are these people
[28:34] going to be productive in our society or
[28:36] not. And most importantly,
[28:38] are they going to assimilate to becoming
[28:41] American? That is one of the best parts
[28:44] about America is that every other
[28:45] country in the world does not have the
[28:48] ability to make someone assimilate. But
[28:49] that is what made America work. That is
[28:51] why we have so many different cultures.
[28:52] If you if you move to Bulgaria, you
[28:54] could never be Bulgarian, Anthony. Oh,
[28:56] hell no. And they don't ask you to be
[28:57] Bulgarian. Best thing, they don't ask
[28:59] you to be Bulgarian. What we ask of
[29:01] people is that we say this is a melting
[29:03] pot of different cultures that all come
[29:04] here. The one thing that we ask you
[29:06] above everything else is for you to
[29:07] become an American. And if you become an
[29:10] American, it means that you believe in
[29:12] core core values of America. I just
[29:15] think like what you said earlier,
[29:16] society has been has bifurcated so much
[29:19] that I I cannot see a world in which
[29:22] something truly brings us back together
[29:25] and makes us all feel proud to be
[29:27] American together. It's just so many
[29:30] people are now, you know, unfortunately
[29:32] so far gone. The thing that does is
[29:34] usually some sort of horrific tragedy.
[29:37] Wait, we thought CO would do that. If
[29:39] you think about uh 9/11, I know, but
[29:41] that patriotism skyrocketed, but that
[29:43] was 2000. Like I just Well, we don't
[29:46] want to have horrific, you know, tragic,
[29:48] but I'm saying like we've gone so far. I
[29:50] I don't know if society even before
[29:52] 9/11. I think people are still very
[29:54] proud to be American. I don't think it
[29:56] was that uh of course, of course,
[29:59] there's polarization. There's social
[30:00] media, there's the media, there there's
[30:01] all these things, but I'm just saying
[30:02] like that that is when patriotism
[30:04] skyrockets is like it it's kind of like
[30:06] we can fight with each other, but if
[30:07] somebody attacks us from outside like,
[30:08] hey, we're we're Americans. I and I do I
[30:11] do think that on a microcosm of a scale,
[30:14] New York City is like the place where
[30:16] that happens. Like I've seen such acts
[30:18] of kindness to random humans like on the
[30:21] street here that I don't think I would
[30:23] necessarily if I was walking alone in
[30:25] Atlanta uh and somebody saw me
[30:27] struggling with something. I don't think
[30:28] they'd help. Look, there's kind people
[30:31] everywhere. There's everywhere,
[30:32] right? New York has uh a magnifying
[30:35] glass on both because there's just 9
[30:38] million people living in a city, right?
[30:39] So I I think that it is uh yes, we would
[30:42] like to think cuz we live here that it's
[30:43] you know there's nicer people or
[30:45] whatever. I think that you're going to
[30:46] get the same amount of people pretty
[30:47] much everywhere. Um, but with that said,
[30:50] I think another core component of this
[30:51] is um, when you become a citizen of the
[30:54] United States, which you did, uh, they
[30:56] ask you I went to a little flag
[30:58] ceremony. What do they ask you? They ask
[31:00] you to pledge allegiance to America to
[31:03] the flag and to denounce allegiance to
[31:07] any other country to renounce. But um,
[31:10] yes, but you don't have to do it in any
[31:12] sort of obviously official way. It's
[31:14] just more of like a I promise. It's a
[31:16] gentleman's agreement. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[31:18] People are breaking the gentleman's
[31:19] agreement. Of course, they have more
[31:21] allegiance to another country than
[31:23] America. Which means ultimately which
[31:26] means but like also this country has not
[31:27] allowed them to become American is the
[31:29] point. But here's but here's the whole
[31:31] thing is again it goes back to we have
[31:33] to create an efficient legal way for
[31:35] people to become uh immigrants. Now I
[31:38] know people who uh you know online were
[31:41] talking about this saying oh look uh
[31:43] people who escaped a country are waving
[31:45] that country's flag blah blah blah
[31:46] whatever there's some of that going on
[31:48] for sure but one of the parts of this
[31:51] whole thing
[31:53] what is the professional planning what
[31:56] is the professional coordination what is
[31:58] the professional logistics that are
[31:59] going into that erupted way too fast
[32:03] there is no way that you get a bunch of
[32:05] strangers who can go out in such a
[32:08] coordinated effort in so many different
[32:10] locations and somehow they all got rocks
[32:12] in their pockets. They all got masks.
[32:14] They all got where they get all the
[32:16] flags from, right? All that stuff.
[32:18] Again, I don't know how that works, but
[32:21] I just think that there's always layers
[32:23] to this stuff that we don't see on the
[32:24] surface. And so what you have to say to
[32:26] yourself is the only thing I know is
[32:27] that you can go and you can think from
[32:29] first principles. There's a lot of
[32:30] people want to come to the United States
[32:31] of America. It's the greatest country in
[32:32] the world. And there's a line out the
[32:33] door. Let's make it good, easy, cheap,
[32:37] and fast for the good people to get in.
[32:39] What's good? Somebody smarter than me
[32:41] will figure out. Are you a productive
[32:42] part of the citizens? Uh are you not
[32:44] going to be a threat to your fellow
[32:46] citizens? Are whatever criteria,
[32:48] somebody else will figure that out. But
[32:49] the ones that we want here, let's go get
[32:51] them. the people who are a threat. I
[32:53] don't know if you've been paying
[32:54] attention to this FBI. They've been
[32:55] arresting arresting a number of Chinese
[32:59] citizens who have either shipped or
[33:02] brought pathogens with them into the
[33:05] United States. Interesting. So, this
[33:07] stuff's going on every single day. And I
[33:09] think that if we can figure out a way to
[33:11] get the people we want here, great.
[33:13] People we don't want, keep them out.
[33:15] Have a border. Iron fist on the rules.
[33:16] Empathy for humans. Super complex. I'm
[33:19] glad I'm not the person who's got to
[33:20] figure it all out. Let's end with this.
[33:22] Um Trump is supposed to announce a Trump
[33:25] savings account, which is a program that
[33:27] would deposit $1,000 in investment
[33:29] accounts for newborn Americans. Dell
[33:31] Technologies pledged Monday to provide
[33:33] the same amount for so-called Trump
[33:35] Accounts for new children of its
[33:37] employees. The provision to create the
[33:39] accounts passed the House last month as
[33:41] part of the major tax cut bill that
[33:42] Trump is pushing Republicans to send to
[33:45] his desk before the 4th of July. What do
[33:48] you think about that? I love this. So,
[33:49] what it's it's $1,000 in stock. So, Brad
[33:53] Gersonner, who will never get enough
[33:55] credit for this, but Brad Gersonner is
[33:57] the founder of Invest America, and the
[33:58] whole idea is uh there's a lot of people
[34:00] who don't participate in the capitalist
[34:02] system. So, if the government can seed
[34:04] $1,000 in an account, and I think it
[34:07] goes and buys the S&P 500, and it just
[34:09] holds that, I can't remember if it's
[34:10] until you're 18 or 22 years old. uh if
[34:12] you let that compound for 20 years. And
[34:14] it allows for additional private
[34:16] contributions of up to $5,000 per year.
[34:18] Yeah. So somebody can keep putting more
[34:20] money in this thing, but you get to have
[34:23] that compound over time. And so when you
[34:25] become 18, 20, 22, whatever the age is,
[34:27] uh you have benefited from the American
[34:30] economy, the American stock market. One,
[34:32] you probably don't hate America. Two,
[34:35] you probably don't hate capitalism. But
[34:37] more importantly, even if you hate
[34:38] America and you hate capitalism, at
[34:39] least you've got a bucket of cash now
[34:42] and economic value that you can go and
[34:43] get a head start in life. That's the
[34:46] whole idea. It's a fantastic idea. Now,
[34:50] do I like the fact that we need the
[34:52] government to do this because the
[34:53] system's broken. They're debasing the
[34:55] currency. People are No, of course not.
[34:57] Do I want them to print money to do
[34:59] this? No, of course not. But it's better
[35:02] a solution than not having it at all.
[35:04] And so, I think that Brad Gers's done a
[35:05] fantastic job. I think that there's a
[35:07] number of other people who are all
[35:08] involved in this. Vlad Tennvivv, fellow
[35:10] Bulgarian who runs Robin Hood. Uh he is
[35:14] uh I think going to be one of the
[35:17] platforms where people can hold the
[35:18] accounts. See, I like I like in this
[35:21] public private, you know, partnership
[35:24] thing where yes, okay, $1,000 the
[35:27] government puts in, but then companies
[35:29] can use it as perks for their employees
[35:31] to say, "Hey, we'll keep investing in
[35:34] this for you and your kids." And I like
[35:36] that. Yeah, it's great. Well, because
[35:38] Michael Dell's smart and he understands
[35:40] that that's a great perk for his
[35:41] employees. There's a lot of people who
[35:42] aren't gonna see that as uh being super
[35:45] smart, but whatever. Let's see what
[35:46] happens. Well, but I love the idea. Hope
[35:48] that it gets passed. Uh
[35:51] I It's no secret. I would love for every
[35:54] single kid in America to have exposure
[35:55] to the US stock market. I I remember,
[35:57] you know what I remember being in high
[35:58] school and like my parents weren't
[36:00] investing anything for me at that time.
[36:02] But um there were a lot of kids who like
[36:06] for their 15th birthday, 16th birthday,
[36:08] whatever, would get like a stock
[36:10] certificate that their grandparents
[36:12] bought them Apple stock. And I was like,
[36:14] that's kind of cool. That's a cool gift.
[36:16] physical one, I guess. I don't know. I
[36:18] mean, like they bought stock in Apple
[36:20] for the Yeah, but but like that's that's
[36:22] awesome. That that kid in 2003 owns
[36:26] Apple stock, you know? Pretty good.
[36:29] Anyway, well, hopefully they hold.
[36:31] Hopefully. I mean, it's gone up a lot.
[36:34] But now Tim Cook is there. You know what
[36:35] I saw someone said? I don't know if you
[36:37] saw the recent updates, people very
[36:39] controversial. They're saying Steve Jobs
[36:41] rolling over in his in his grave. Why?
[36:43] And design don't look as hot. You know,
[36:46] this thing got the the cool factor. We
[36:47] don't know what somebody So, somebody
[36:49] said uh Tim ain't cooking.
[36:53] On that note, that's it for today, guys.
[36:55] We'll see you guys next week.
