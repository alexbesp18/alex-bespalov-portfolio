[00:00] The single biggest intelligence test of
[00:02] our generation is are they going to keep
[00:04] printing money? And if yes, buy, right?
[00:08] Like like that kind of seems where we're
[00:10] ending up that people almost don't even
[00:13] really pay attention over time. What
[00:15] happened with Alon Musk yesterday is
[00:16] very symbolic of that whole thing, which
[00:18] is regardless of what happens, there
[00:20] will be more printing this year in some
[00:22] form, some shape or fashion. either the
[00:24] deficit stays at this level or they
[00:26] figure out some way again to help the
[00:28] people they're trying to help. And I
[00:30] think Trump has made it crystal clear.
[00:32] So if rates go higher.
[00:35] What's going on guys? Today we've got an
[00:36] excellent episode with Jordy Visser.
[00:38] He's got 30 years on Wall Street and
[00:39] he's here to explain to us what's going
[00:41] on with Elon Musk and Donald Trump
[00:43] feuding on the internet. How's it going
[00:45] to impact your investment portfolio? We
[00:47] of course talk about things like
[00:48] Bitcoin, stable coins, the circle IPO
[00:50] and why so much capital is flowing into
[00:53] all corners of the investment portfolios
[00:56] that both institutions and retail have.
[00:58] And of course, we're going to talk about
[00:59] all the things geopolitics, economic
[01:01] policy, and why money printing and the
[01:04] national debt are the two things you got
[01:06] to continue to pay attention to. Here's
[01:07] my latest conversation with Jordy
[01:09] Visser. All right, Jordy, I thought a
[01:10] great place to start the conversation is
[01:11] we have Elon Musk, Donald Trump, the
[01:13] world's richest man versus the world's
[01:15] most powerful man. I mean, this is
[01:18] entertaining as hell, but also probably
[01:20] not good for the country. What's your
[01:21] take on these two guys going at it in
[01:23] public? All right. Well, first of all,
[01:26] it's all on social media. Everyone can
[01:27] enjoy it. So, it was fun. I'm actually
[01:31] taking a different take on this. Um,
[01:35] so to get to this point, and you have to
[01:37] remember all of the videos of him
[01:41] at the inauguration, the childlike looks
[01:44] he was giving, how happy he was, the
[01:46] double thumbs up, and I mean Alon Musk
[01:48] starting Doge, talking about trillions
[01:50] of dollars that he was going to find.
[01:52] And in a span of 4 months, the world's
[01:57] richest man and arguably the smartest
[01:59] who's created more billion dollar
[02:01] businesses than anyone alive.
[02:04] He's broken by the debt and deficit.
[02:07] Like literally, it came down to the fact
[02:09] that he's complaining that they couldn't
[02:12] do anything in this bill. So the fight
[02:14] at the end, Elon Musk got to the point
[02:16] where he's literally attacking
[02:20] saying, "Throw them all out. get rid of
[02:22] them. If that isn't a statement that we
[02:26] tried everything we could with
[02:27] austerity, we tried everything we could
[02:30] to get out of this. Uh the fight
[02:32] yesterday was just the culmination point
[02:34] of you can't stop the fiscal problems
[02:38] that we have no matter how you try. And
[02:40] it was only a week ago that he said, I
[02:42] guess I got to go off and try to be, you
[02:44] know, productivity is going to h get us
[02:46] out of this. but he couldn't resist the
[02:49] fact that they were going to put this
[02:50] bill in and it wasn't going to do
[02:52] anything to fix it. I think people
[02:54] should just lean back and just realize
[02:55] if they had any doubts coming into this
[02:57] year about how we were going to handle
[03:00] the economy, that was that was the
[03:03] fireworks show to say there's no way
[03:05] because if there was anything possible
[03:07] that could have happened, the smartest
[03:08] man would have. It felt like um it was
[03:10] the and I before I say this, I love Elon
[03:13] Musk. I obviously think that he's an
[03:14] incredible entrepreneur. things that
[03:15] he's done not only in terms of actual
[03:17] productivity and and building products
[03:19] and services, but I think that he has
[03:20] really inspired a generation of people
[03:22] to think bigger and try to build things
[03:24] etc. But it was kind of the temper
[03:25] tantrum at the end, right? It's like,
[03:27] you know, we got the the kid, they get
[03:28] frustrated, they don't know what else to
[03:30] do, so they just, you know, scream. And
[03:32] that kind of felt like there was the
[03:33] explosion of that. Um, but what I do
[03:36] think is fascinating is I uh interviewed
[03:39] yesterday uh Russ VA who is the director
[03:41] of the office of management and budget.
[03:44] And Russ um when I asked him about the
[03:47] blowing out of the deficit and the
[03:49] increasing of uh of the debt etc. he
[03:51] said to me well it depends on how you're
[03:54] analyzing it which you know okay tell me
[03:56] more and what he explained to me was the
[03:58] CBO uh is using this like baseline uh
[04:02] kind of projection and then they see
[04:04] each bill does it increase or decrease
[04:06] it. I'm not an expert on the national
[04:08] debt or on on these bills, but what I
[04:10] did find interesting was he claims that
[04:12] the bill that they're putting forward
[04:13] will reduce the deficit by $1.4 trillion
[04:16] over 10 years. Again, I don't know if
[04:17] that's true or if it's not, but what I
[04:19] started to unpack from that conversation
[04:21] was a bunch of the forward projections
[04:24] of the impact of these bills really
[04:26] comes down to like are we using your
[04:28] algorithm or mine? Are we using your
[04:29] spreadsheet or my spreadsheet? Like
[04:31] whose model, whose baseline, whose
[04:32] assumptions, right? And so it actually
[04:34] makes me wonder how much of the entire
[04:36] debate is just like don't even engage in
[04:38] it. And it's more so I think what Elon
[04:40] is saying now like you just can only
[04:42] control one side of this equation which
[04:43] is productivity. All of us should stop
[04:45] trying to get the government to do
[04:46] anything and let's all just go try to
[04:47] build companies you know and increase
[04:48] GDP. Yeah. I find so I don't think I've
[04:52] ever I we've ever done this here and I
[04:54] may have mentioned it once but I want to
[04:57] simplify the the US economy and it'll
[05:00] bring it into kind of the way it
[05:02] eventually brought me to Bitcoin but
[05:03] especially this artificial intelligence
[05:05] side right now. Think of the economy as
[05:07] now being three pieces. It's the
[05:10] industrial economy which is filled with
[05:12] debt and is growing very very slowly.
[05:14] We've been weaning off manufacturing
[05:15] jobs. We've exported or we we've
[05:18] imported everything. we don't make
[05:19] anything. And that part has a lot of the
[05:22] people that support Trump in it. You've
[05:24] got the digital economy, not as many
[05:25] workers, no debt. That one's growing
[05:28] rapidly. And then you have this other
[05:30] economy that was created to balance out
[05:32] the decline in the industrial economy,
[05:34] which is the government economy. The
[05:36] government economy is massive. Anyone
[05:38] who wants to sit here and nitpick about
[05:40] whether this is possibly going to debt
[05:42] to GDP in this country has been going
[05:44] higher consistently since the computer
[05:46] came in and the digital economy started
[05:47] to go. The reason Bitcoin is so
[05:50] important in this conversation and
[05:51] bridges the two is because that
[05:53] government economy cannot shrink. And
[05:55] the reason it cannot shrink, healthc
[05:57] care expenditures are growing right now
[05:59] at 8 to 10% a year because of Medicare,
[06:02] Medicaid, because of the health of the
[06:03] country. There's no way to reverse it.
[06:05] And almost two million people over the
[06:07] last year have started collecting social
[06:10] security benefits. Some of that is
[06:12] demographics. Some of that is just the
[06:13] fear now over the economy. Regardless of
[06:16] any way you want to go through it, what
[06:18] we found out is we tried to do something
[06:20] to balance the deficit. The debt to GDP
[06:22] is not going not going away. So the only
[06:25] parts about this that people should
[06:26] think about, are we going to grow? Yes,
[06:28] I believe this is a growth package. Will
[06:30] it be able to grow more than interest
[06:32] rates? Well, that depends on what
[06:34] happens to long-term rates. I just think
[06:36] at this point we're going to have a
[06:38] normalization of rates, the pressure is
[06:40] going to be on long-term rates to move
[06:42] higher, not lower. And even if they stay
[06:44] right around the same area, which is
[06:46] pretty much a good thing for equities,
[06:48] it's not a good thing for fixing the
[06:49] deficit in the budgets. They can play
[06:50] around with all the numbers. The reality
[06:51] is this has been going on for a long
[06:53] time and the government cannot be shrunk
[06:56] because the voters don't want the
[06:58] government to shrink. And that's what we
[06:59] found out with this bill. So Q1 we had
[07:02] uh negative GDP. Uh Q2 we're in boom
[07:06] times. The uh Atlanta Fed's GDP now is
[07:10] like up over 4%. Um it feels like all
[07:13] the people who are predicting the
[07:15] recessions, depressions, and Black
[07:16] Fridays, they don't want to talk about
[07:18] the fact that uh if you don't get two
[07:20] straight quarters of negative GDP
[07:22] growth, you can't have a recession. I
[07:23] think you previously had said a number
[07:25] of times, you can't have a recession if
[07:26] people aren't losing their jobs. Um, how
[07:29] are you looking at this economic data
[07:30] right now? Because it sure looks like
[07:31] this was a V-shaped recovery.
[07:33] Reflexivity is real and the economic
[07:36] growth is coming roaring right back.
[07:38] Yeah, first quarter was obviously
[07:40] distorted because of um
[07:44] the import numbers which went violently
[07:46] ahead of the tariffs. So by having a ton
[07:50] of imports, no exports, the trade data
[07:52] subtracted a significant amount from
[07:53] GDP. So if you just use domestic final
[07:57] sales, the growth was close to 3%. Um
[08:00] the second quarter I'm going to guess is
[08:02] actually going to be less than that. So
[08:04] I wouldn't take in what's happened. The
[08:06] main point is we're not in a recession.
[08:08] Um as I said, and this is an important
[08:10] part, healthc care is about 18% of
[08:14] nominal GDP and that's growing as I said
[08:17] at 8 to 10%. So if you just take that
[08:20] part, forget the AI part that we took,
[08:22] there's just no way to have recessions
[08:25] and there's no way for the economy to
[08:27] fall off the map unless we do agree, you
[08:30] know, we fire tons of people from the
[08:31] government and we have tariffs go up to
[08:33] whatever. None of that's happening. So
[08:35] the economy is fine and that's the other
[08:37] pressure point for rates. It's the
[08:38] reason why it's going to be difficult
[08:39] for the Fed to cut. I will say all of
[08:42] the data on the jobs situation
[08:46] is starting to become a little bit more
[08:48] problematic and I think in the second
[08:50] half of the year the realization is
[08:51] going to set in that AI is not
[08:54] destroying jobs
[08:57] but it's hurting the ability for
[09:00] companies to hire and I don't think
[09:02] we're going to be able to have like a
[09:04] significant growth period. Housing
[09:06] market is very very soft. It's not
[09:08] collapsing. So anyone who sits there and
[09:10] starts seeing charts of there's so many
[09:12] sellers in this, it's just soft.
[09:14] Commercial real estate soft. We've
[09:16] talked about long duration assets. I
[09:18] think the economy is kind of in this
[09:19] state where the second half of the year
[09:21] people should expect
[09:23] 2% GDP in terms of real growth. Maybe if
[09:26] inflation stays lower, we can get closer
[09:28] to three. But from an equity verse bond
[09:30] perspective, bonds are not the
[09:33] investment. It is stocks, stocks,
[09:34] stocks. And I think we're getting
[09:36] closer. One important thing on the stock
[09:37] market for people this week. So far this
[09:40] rally has really been driven um again by
[09:42] tech as we've come out of this. So uh
[09:44] you and I have talked and I believe that
[09:46] semiconductors and some of the names
[09:48] that I've mentioned here like Micron
[09:49] broke out this week. We're starting to
[09:51] see the realization I'm hearing it more
[09:54] and more like hey this buildout of both
[09:56] nuclear and the data centers this
[09:59] compute thing is real. So they're
[10:01] finally getting back on board that and
[10:03] semiconductors are unchanged from a year
[10:05] ago. So, I think there are some
[10:06] investment themes that will get people
[10:07] excited, but the thing that they should
[10:08] all watch is we need to see some kind of
[10:11] inclusion from small cap, particularly
[10:13] with this audience that cares a lot
[10:14] about the utility side of of crypto. You
[10:17] need to have small cap start to come up
[10:19] a little bit here. And I'll I'll talk
[10:20] about that later. Yeah, we'll explain
[10:22] why that's so important. So, uh, at this
[10:25] point, it's been a very concentrated
[10:26] market. And uh as I've gotten more,
[10:30] let's say, in the community from the
[10:32] crypto side, I've started to realize the
[10:35] importance of and I'll just give three
[10:37] that I I I monitor every single day.
[10:39] Ethereum, Salana, and Sweet. And I'm
[10:41] just watching. And the reason this is
[10:44] important is there's two sides of the of
[10:46] the crypto market. The one is the
[10:48] institutional movement towards Bitcoin,
[10:50] which is happening. You and I both hear
[10:51] it. We see it. It's there. There's a bid
[10:53] underneath. that acts like a raging
[10:56] thing that'll eventually break out to
[10:57] the upside. And I still believe that
[10:58] we're going to have a short squeeze this
[11:00] year. What has contained it though is we
[11:02] don't have the enthusiasm and the
[11:05] trading and the the oomph that's
[11:07] necessary for the innovation side. It's
[11:10] clearly happening on the stable coin
[11:11] side. People see it. I mean, you saw the
[11:13] way circle traded. You saw the
[11:14] excitement. You've you've seen what's
[11:16] happened on every deal that's come to
[11:18] the market. Crypto has it has an energy
[11:21] there, but it doesn't have the
[11:23] speculation right now. It doesn't have
[11:24] the memecoin side. It doesn't have any
[11:26] of them. If you do charts of any of
[11:27] those names I mentioned relative to
[11:29] Bitcoin, it's straight low. It looks
[11:31] like QQQ to IWM or for people not
[11:35] following those ETFs, innovation versus
[11:38] small cap stocks at some point, Beta
[11:41] needs to do well. And I think that's
[11:44] what we're getting close to. I've kind
[11:45] of said once Ethereum gets above 2650 to
[11:48] 2700 and you actually get a break above
[11:51] there, I think that is going to be the
[11:53] the point where you start to see more
[11:55] speculation and belief that the
[11:56] innovation side of crypto is there on
[11:59] top of the institutional adoption side.
[12:01] When you start looking at um Bitcoin in
[12:03] particular, it feels like uh Bitcoin
[12:06] trading down while Elon and uh Trump
[12:08] were arguing. Um I had a lot of people
[12:10] calling me. I think you had people
[12:12] reaching out to you saying, "Hey, is
[12:14] Bitcoin going down because these guys
[12:16] are arguing or does it just happen to be
[12:17] a coincidence?" How do you evaluate uh
[12:20] kind of a decentralized liquid asset
[12:22] that trades 24/7 um when the two, you
[12:25] know, most powerful rich people in the
[12:27] world are uh are over here debating.

[13:26] The great thing about watching retail
[13:28] traders, um, they're all momentum based
[13:31] and they're just going with what's
[13:32] working. If you do an overlay of a chart
[13:36] this year and actually into the
[13:38] election,
[13:39] let's think about it. Elon Musk was
[13:41] connected to Trump, Bitcoin was
[13:43] connected to Trump. The overlay of those
[13:46] two, Bitcoin and Tesla, has been very I
[13:48] mean, it's almost one for one. There was
[13:50] like a brief period where they broke
[13:52] away for a little bit, but it's pretty
[13:54] much the same thing.
[13:56] there shouldn't be that way. And so I
[13:58] understood why people to some degree
[14:00] were like, "Oh my god, it's not going."
[14:01] And it was because it was falling. But
[14:03] the reality is what Tesla and Musk
[14:05] represent to me was the only thing
[14:08] working in the market for the
[14:09] speculation side. Palanteer's gone back
[14:11] up to highs. But again, it has been a
[14:13] very difficult time for traders. Uh you
[14:16] and I saw each other in Miami back in in
[14:19] January. Uh you know, we were wearing
[14:21] bananas around our neck. It was a
[14:23] little, you know, the banana zone was
[14:24] was what everyone was talking about.
[14:26] Well, you know, the inauguration kind of
[14:28] destroyed that enthusiasm with the
[14:30] memecoin coming out. Then you had the
[14:32] Malay situation and everyone kind of
[14:34] lost it and then everything broke down.
[14:36] I think we've been building up the
[14:38] trading side right now and Tesla falling
[14:40] to me will break the correlation between
[14:42] Bitcoin and Tesla and now I think again
[14:44] it's going to for us to get to 200 in a
[14:47] short amount of time in Bitcoin.
[14:49] Ethereum, Salana, and Sweet have to be
[14:51] part of that move. And I think we're
[14:53] getting closer to that move now. And the
[14:56] participation of kind of the altcoin
[14:57] market, is that net new dollars coming
[14:59] into the market, you think, or is that
[15:01] kind of a redistribution of people
[15:03] saying, "Hey, Bitcoin's gone up a lot
[15:04] since uh maybe I bought during this last
[15:06] cycle, and now I'm just going to kind of
[15:07] push out further on the risk curve to
[15:09] try to capture more upside as we
[15:11] continue in the bull market."
[15:13] I I think um to use a phrase that I hear
[15:18] a lot uh pencils are down with a lot of
[15:20] people right now. I don't know if you're
[15:21] getting approached. I've had more people
[15:23] ask me about Bit Tenzer in the last
[15:26] month and these are from people that
[15:28] have never bought crypto. So the one
[15:30] thing I like is that family office like
[15:32] everyone's now realizing um you know I
[15:34] have to have an allocation here. They're
[15:36] not doing it because it's at all-time
[15:37] highs. They're looking at these things
[15:39] because they believe in AI and so be
[15:41] tender. They literally send me
[15:43] something. They send me the deck. Hey,
[15:44] I'm getting presented this. What do you
[15:45] think? I go, which part? Well, you're an
[15:48] AI guy and a crypto guy. This should be
[15:49] right up your alley. And I'm like,
[15:50] here's the here's the deal. If I'm right
[15:53] about Bitcoin, all of these things are
[15:54] going to do well because to get to those
[15:56] levels, there has to be energy and
[15:58] investment from you guys with inside the
[16:01] beta because the beta forces the strong
[16:03] to go higher. The S&P 500 cannot go up
[16:06] right now without the NASDAQ. It needs
[16:08] the NASDAQ because the MAG 7 are part of
[16:11] it. I've said this before and I know
[16:13] people don't embrace it this way. I view
[16:15] Bitcoin as the ultimate S&P 500 of the
[16:21] world in 15 to 20 years that it will
[16:24] just keep sucking in all of this money.
[16:27] And the beauty of it is that it can't be
[16:29] out innovated. That's the beauty of it
[16:32] is that it can't actually lose its
[16:34] status as an investment where everything
[16:36] in the equity market always does. We
[16:38] brought up Tesla. I just want to make
[16:39] sure people realize this. The market cap
[16:41] of Tesla is $1 trillion. They have
[16:43] almost no debt.
[16:45] Ford and GM combined, you see more of
[16:48] those on the road than you do Tesla's,
[16:50] their cars. If people don't notice,
[16:51] hundred billion of equity, that's their
[16:53] market cap. 100 billion. They have 300
[16:57] billion of debt. That is that industrial
[17:00] economy. What Bitcoin doesn't have is it
[17:03] doesn't have any of that stuff. It just
[17:05] has a store of value that makes it kind
[17:07] of like gold. But really, as more money
[17:09] goes into the ecosystem, and that's why
[17:12] hearing people call about Bitenzer, that
[17:14] means people that have never invested in
[17:15] crypto like, I think I got to get
[17:17] involved in this, but I want to find
[17:18] stuff that can go up 10fold. And I
[17:20] always say the same thing, your problem
[17:22] with investing in any of these
[17:23] innovations. If you invest in 10 of them
[17:26] and you get two of them right, you've
[17:27] done well. The exit strategy on these
[17:30] things is very, very difficult. Well,
[17:32] and I think it's also um even if I look
[17:34] at my own portfolio, right, like Bitcoin
[17:36] is the thing that I will never sell.
[17:37] It's kind of the timeless investing
[17:38] principle. Buy great assets, never sell
[17:39] them. Um, everything else that we've
[17:41] ever held in crypto, uh, whether it's
[17:44] for short periods of time or medium
[17:45] periods of time, we always knew when we
[17:47] bought it, we're going to sell it. And I
[17:48] think that that is a very very
[17:50] different, uh, mentality. And then
[17:52] naturally, uh, everyone is trying to
[17:53] sell before the next person, right? And
[17:55] so, you just kind of short circuit th
[17:57] those uh, things. Um, one of the things
[17:59] that is going very well right now is the
[18:00] Circle IPO happened this week. and uh
[18:02] Circle went out I think at one point the
[18:04] stock was up 2 300% uh on the first day
[18:07] of trading. Um how do you read so much
[18:10] uh excitement and performance coming
[18:12] from something like the Circle IPO?
[18:13] Circle represents something very
[18:15] important so people hear it. Um
[18:18] I remember back in October when I
[18:20] started kind of going around to people
[18:22] that that understand the crypto space
[18:24] extremely well. Um one macro person in
[18:27] particular and I said I think stablecoin
[18:29] is the most important investment theme
[18:30] for next year. And he was like, "How do
[18:32] you make money off stable coins?" And
[18:34] I'm like, "Stable coins are the bridge
[18:37] between the two worlds. It's going to
[18:38] bring confidence in people that this is
[18:41] the place that I have to invest in and
[18:43] it'll lead to stuff in the altcoins.
[18:44] It'll lead to Bitcoin, everything. We
[18:46] need the ecosystem to grow with wealthy
[18:48] people." The only types of people that
[18:51] I've seen I see Trad I'll leave you out
[18:54] of this at this point on one side.
[18:56] You've been in long enough. So the OGs
[18:58] that have been involved from a very
[19:00] early stage and then the Tradfi people
[19:03] that made the bet to get involved, but
[19:05] to get wealthy people that are wealthy
[19:07] from the fiat world at this stage and
[19:09] then have them come in, it's very
[19:11] challenging. It it it's very hard for
[19:13] them to say, I want to be involved and
[19:14] if they get involved, they want to move
[19:16] into the ecosystem. What Circle has done
[19:19] in my opinion, it matches up with the
[19:21] stable coin bill. Like it forces people
[19:23] to understand like why is this so
[19:25] important? Why is JP Morgan? Why Goldman
[19:28] Sachs? Why are all these people now
[19:29] speaking public about what what are
[19:31] stable coins? I think people haven't
[19:33] understood it. And this will force more
[19:35] people to go. And once you get into
[19:36] stable coins and you really dig deep, I
[19:40] think you can easily make the transition
[19:42] over into the other side. And I and
[19:44] we've talked about this, but I just want
[19:46] to make sure people get it. The volumes
[19:48] are going to explode over the next 5
[19:50] years. Not just because the guard rails
[19:53] are going up, not just because of the
[19:54] work of bridge and stripe and all these
[19:56] people that are out there going, it's
[19:57] going to go up because of AI agents.
[19:59] That connection and the amount of
[20:01] volumes that are going to happen where
[20:02] the easiest way to pay is in that way. I
[20:06] I listened to a podcast this week and a
[20:08] guy who doesn't code went on to Replet.
[20:10] He had the one of the he had the replet
[20:12] founder on and he said, "I created a
[20:16] software overnight and I connected it to
[20:20] Stripe and I got a payment in already
[20:21] this morning." That's the kind of world
[20:23] we're living in. And the fact that
[20:25] stable coins are going to be the the
[20:26] chosen transaction, the money system and
[20:29] the bridge between the two is there.
[20:30] Yeah, it's uh it's fascinating to me
[20:32] that um once you start to hook up a lot
[20:35] of these technologies, it it's kind of
[20:36] like Bitcoin is an accelerator, stable
[20:38] coins are an accelerator, AI is an
[20:40] accelerator, humanoid robots are an
[20:42] accelerator, but then when you stack
[20:43] them on top of each other, it's like
[20:45] you're not 1+ 1 plus 1 plus 1, you know,
[20:47] it is like times 5, 10, time 20. And
[20:52] what I think that does do though is it
[20:53] draws a line in uh kind of time. And I
[20:57] don't know where you would place the
[20:59] exact uh bifurcation but there is an old
[21:01] world and there's a new world. I think
[21:03] over the last decade at least we have
[21:04] lived through this explosion from um
[21:07] really what was like the first internet
[21:09] era to now we got the Facebooks and you
[21:11] know the X's and all of those things
[21:13] really kind of hit their stride grew to
[21:15] large scale um and we also started to
[21:17] get the cryptocurrency we started a lot
[21:18] of the AI stuff etc.
[21:20] What I wonder is how much of the legacy
[21:24] financial system is set up to understand
[21:26] this world. So not even invest yet, just
[21:28] understand it. There's a story from this
[21:30] week that um uh you called out that I
[21:32] think is really important where now
[21:34] economists, this is not you and I, this
[21:36] is not zero hedge. This is not, you
[21:38] know, maybe people that we would be
[21:39] sympathetic to on the internet. These
[21:40] are economists who are calling into
[21:43] question the US inflation data and
[21:45] they're saying it may not be accurate
[21:47] partially because they don't have enough
[21:48] people to use their antiquated methods
[21:50] to go and calculate the inflation. And
[21:53] so it it goes back to this thing of uh
[21:56] Secretary Besset was asked by the All-In
[21:58] podcast, do you believe the economic
[22:00] data? And the first word out of his
[22:01] mouth was no. And then he quickly
[22:03] backtracked and you try to make it more
[22:05] kind of a polished answer.
[22:08] What do we take about this idea that the
[22:10] inflation data may be wrong or other
[22:12] economic data points that are used for
[22:14] the traditional financial world to
[22:15] invest capital? Well, we have the
[22:18] payroll number today. Um, the
[22:20] expectations at this point that I've
[22:22] seen are that last year and this year
[22:25] the data will have been overstated by
[22:27] about 50 to 60,000 jobs a month. All the
[22:31] data is bad.
[22:32] It's hard enough um to capture what
[22:35] happens in an economy that's complex,
[22:38] but as we've gone more into the digital
[22:40] economy and things have sped up, as Alon
[22:43] Mus said, we're still using systems from
[22:45] hundreds of years ago. The technology is
[22:48] archaic in terms of being able to count
[22:49] anything. And I found in his case what
[22:52] he said, not just the fraud, but the
[22:54] inability to do things. And when he
[22:56] asked to actually see the Treasury
[22:58] receipts and actually go the way anyone
[23:00] would go through to figure out what the
[23:01] math is, he couldn't believe he couldn't
[23:03] see anything. So, I think people have
[23:05] been able to trade off this cuz there
[23:07] wasn't another world that existed.
[23:11] I listened to an interview with Deis
[23:13] Hassabis uh this week. I've listened to
[23:16] him about three times in the last two
[23:17] weeks. This was a really good one. It
[23:18] was again right after the the Google IO
[23:21] developer conference,
[23:23] but he just talked again about how fast
[23:25] things are speeding up. And so
[23:29] when you revise jobs, a year reverse and
[23:33] what he's saying is that what equates to
[23:35] every year in innovation of AI is about
[23:38] 10 years of the past. You have to really
[23:40] think about what I mean that's just a
[23:42] staggering number. That's how fast
[23:44] everything is changing on the AI side.
[23:46] So there's no way that GDP, a statistic
[23:48] created in the 1930s, can possibly
[23:50] comprehend what happens with the
[23:52] intangible side of the economy. I will
[23:54] say I'm beginning to hear more
[23:56] economists,
[23:57] they tend to be on the younger side, uh,
[24:01] admit this. I've been yelling this since
[24:03] I first went to Silicon Valley and
[24:04] started changing my views, which was in
[24:06] 2013 at Singularity University. I don't
[24:08] think most economists have done this,
[24:10] but they are starting to turn. And I
[24:12] think that puts a much more difficult
[24:14] situation on all of the traditional
[24:16] finance world cuz they are still
[24:17] believing still
[24:20] that we're going to go back and retest
[24:22] the lows. We had the she call this week.
[24:25] Uh rare earth was all over the papers
[24:29] this week. We talked about it I think
[24:31] last week if not the week before about
[24:33] how important this was that China
[24:35] controlled the world's rare earth. That
[24:39] phone call to me followed up by Trump
[24:42] admitting that we're going to go out to
[24:44] China. If there was any doubt about
[24:47] what's going to happen between China and
[24:48] the US, it's the tariff. We do not have
[24:51] the upper hand on the tariff situation.
[24:53] I'm not saying they don't have the same
[24:55] kind of risk. But this is a mutually
[24:57] destructive situation, which means for
[25:00] everyone that's there, I like seeing
[25:01] that small cap stocks are about to break
[25:03] higher. I love that the sentiment's
[25:04] still not there. I love that Ethereum
[25:05] and Salana haven't broken out. I kind of
[25:07] get the feeling this squeeze thing is
[25:09] going to be a summertime thing more and
[25:10] more. Well, with China, it feels like
[25:13] that mutual destruction is like who can
[25:15] withstand more pain, right? We know that
[25:17] both sides are being uh kind of chipped
[25:19] away at and it's just like who calls
[25:20] uncle first and uh the meeting in
[25:23] Switzerland where they decided to reduce
[25:25] the terrorist by 115% was kind of like a
[25:27] hey, we're not really going to destroy
[25:29] each other, right? It's like let's put,
[25:30] you know, let's lower our guns. You
[25:31] don't have to put it down completely,
[25:32] but just like don't point them at each
[25:34] other right now. Um and so that then
[25:36] brings us to uh investment portfolio. We
[25:40] know stocks have done very well off the
[25:42] lows in April. Uh you've called out the
[25:44] small cap stocks being very important. I
[25:47] think also the small cap coins kind of a
[25:48] similar uh uh type idea. Um when you
[25:52] look at all of the stocks that have been
[25:54] performing, it seems like we're watching
[25:57] a rotation occur, right? It it does feel
[26:00] like, okay, Mag 7 isn't what it was a
[26:03] year ago, 2 years ago, but then you see
[26:06] like the circle IPO and so like is this
[26:08] something where we're actually going
[26:09] from uh incumbent to challenger in the
[26:13] stock market? Like does that feel like a
[26:15] theme that people can start to kind of
[26:17] uh pay attention to? Because to me, the
[26:20] Mag 7, we know they're going to spend a
[26:21] lot of money on the AI stuff. We know
[26:22] they're going to benefit from that
[26:23] stuff. Um, but it's actually the core
[26:26] weaves and the circles and like if you
[26:28] think of the the stocks that have done
[26:29] really well so far this year, they do
[26:31] seem to have kind of this challenger
[26:33] positioning and they seem to be
[26:35] outperforming the incumbents in their
[26:36] various sectors. Yeah. Today's episode

[28:00] Go check them out today. So, when you
[28:02] get to a point where you've had this
[28:03] major V, um, what I try to look at at
[28:06] the market is what was working on the
[28:09] way down and is still working on the way
[28:11] back up. So, as an example, gold was
[28:15] working on the way down, and it's still
[28:16] sitting at the all-time high. So, it
[28:18] didn't reverse. The dollar has been
[28:19] weaker,
[28:21] was weakening on the way down. It's
[28:22] barely bounced back with everything
[28:24] going on. Those are structural things,
[28:26] and they're both related to the same
[28:27] thing. And the structural thing is the
[28:30] dollar is not the global reserve
[28:31] currency anymore, and the rest of the
[28:32] world realizes that it's kind of
[28:34] nationalism. And so, the dollar has to
[28:36] be under has it's overweight right now
[28:38] in everyone's portfolio, the same thing
[28:40] as US stocks. And gradually over the
[28:42] next three to five years, as long as the
[28:44] tariffs don't force people to panic out,
[28:46] it'll be a slow bleed over time and you
[28:48] should expect that the dollar is going
[28:50] to be on the weaker side. The other
[28:52] thing, so the AI trades did fall. They
[28:54] fell violently. They've snapped back
[28:56] violently.
[28:58] The AI situation in terms of the news
[29:01] did not change. If anything, Meta jumps
[29:04] into constellation. Meta had already
[29:07] upped their investments on the data
[29:09] center. Everyone who got negative on
[29:11] what's happening with AI in the compute
[29:13] side was dead wrong. That's why we're at
[29:15] the early stage of this. Silver broke
[29:17] out this week. Very important level. And
[29:19] I see silver as being part gold but also
[29:23] part of the electrification side. Copper
[29:26] broke above 500 this this week on the
[29:28] futures. There is a shift that's
[29:30] happening in a rotation. The AI trade is
[29:32] still dominating. The the crypto world
[29:35] is still on this path with government
[29:37] supporting it. Government is supporting
[29:40] nuclear government is supporting AI.
[29:43] Government has to support the health
[29:44] care and things like that. It's still
[29:46] trying to help the bottom end. I think
[29:48] everyone just has to get ready by the
[29:50] end of this year. The number one theme
[29:53] is going to be the embodiment of AI and
[29:55] the people understanding that this whole
[29:57] talk of humanoids and everything is
[29:58] going to be real. It has scary
[30:00] consequences for the job situation in
[30:02] terms of this. I get reached out more on
[30:04] this show from things that I say from
[30:06] people about AI. Uh many people have
[30:10] reached out about, hey, I just lost my
[30:12] job. You seem like you you're using AI
[30:15] that much. What's your advice on how to
[30:17] do that? And I'll for the most part,
[30:19] I'll send them a response. But the thing
[30:21] that's come up more and more now is that
[30:23] they're starting to worry about their
[30:24] kids. So this is a weird world where
[30:27] from an investment side I think people
[30:29] need to have money in Bitcoin because I
[30:31] think this is part of that hedge on that
[30:32] that disruption that's going and then
[30:34] for the stocks I think from an
[30:36] investment standpoint the semiconductors
[30:38] uh I believe the power side still
[30:40] remains a great place to be and then
[30:43] even though we'll see a trade in small
[30:44] caps I think small cap companies have a
[30:46] really hard time competing with the
[30:48] larger cap companies but in particular
[30:50] we're going to move away from software
[30:51] and away from coding and I think we're
[30:53] going to spread more into the physical
[30:55] world again and in that physical world
[30:57] uh there seems to be an intersection of
[30:58] technology and the physical world. So uh
[31:00] we know that uh robotics is a huge part
[31:03] of the American manufacturing. Now we do
[31:05] have the administration coming out
[31:06] saying we don't want to make socks and
[31:07] t-shirts here. We want to make you know
[31:08] kind of higherend stuff um that requires
[31:11] kind of precision manufacturing,
[31:12] advanced manufacturing. Um do we have
[31:15] enough talent you think to actually
[31:18] execute on this stuff? Like do we have
[31:19] enough robotic engineers? Do we have
[31:21] enough uh uh people who can actually
[31:23] operate in these facilities? Like I
[31:25] always go back to this idea of um you
[31:27] know Trump even says it right like he
[31:28] he's uh trying to take money from
[31:30] Harvard to give to trade schools and um
[31:33] it does feel like there's like a goal
[31:37] and then we have to ask ourselves do we
[31:38] have enough of the minerals and
[31:40] resources? Do we have enough capital? Do
[31:42] we have the desire? Do we have the
[31:44] talent? Right? Do they have the skills?
[31:46] Like there's a lot to this that maybe is
[31:49] not so obvious on the surface. And
[31:51] talent being kind of a kind of you know
[31:53] crazy component here. We I mean I hear
[31:56] this repeatedly even from from the
[31:58] housing market um with people that are
[32:00] still building they they just say they
[32:02] have shortages. Um we we don't have
[32:04] enough people in that aspect of the
[32:06] economy cuz we've directed everyone more
[32:09] towards different parts.
[32:11] the service side, we have shortages um
[32:14] everything in social work and healthcare
[32:16] nurses and now that immigration is going
[32:18] to be changed significantly and I don't
[32:21] think people have fully come to uh the
[32:24] reality of what that means. Um the whole
[32:26] thing with student visas and we we don't
[32:30] have enough people right now for the
[32:31] physical side of the economy. I wrote a
[32:34] paper this week for 22V on Brazil and
[32:37] I'm very positive on Brazil. Uh I live
[32:39] there. Uh there's just certain times and
[32:42] it usually comes down to two things. If
[32:43] the dollar's weakening, that usually is
[32:45] really good for Brazil. And if there's a
[32:47] commodity boom, that's usually good for
[32:49] Brazil. And I mentioned last week the
[32:51] rare earth side and Brazil being a large
[32:53] player in that market. The rare earth
[32:55] side, we don't have enough. We're going
[32:56] to have to go get it. Uh it was funny
[32:58] that in, you know, Greenland was brought
[33:02] up by the EU this week on rare earth.
[33:04] Like everyone realized across the globe
[33:06] this week, in case you guys didn't see
[33:07] it, uh China not only stopped rare earth
[33:10] exports to the US, it did globally. Uh
[33:12] and that's because the US was going to
[33:14] try and isolate China, negotiate with
[33:15] everyone, said, "Oh, okay. If you're
[33:16] with the US, you don't get rare earth
[33:18] either." Um no auto production, no
[33:21] military. Like China was putting out
[33:23] this really big trump card and saying,
[33:26] "No, fine. If you guys are going to all
[33:28] gang up on us, then we're going to stop
[33:30] rare earth." So I think when we come out
[33:32] of this, which I expect now the
[33:33] negotiations to go much faster with
[33:35] China. That's what I think this week
[33:36] with the rare earth kind of set off. I
[33:39] think what you're going to have is
[33:40] people start to move around and start to
[33:41] focus again on okay, we have to go as
[33:43] fast as possible with rare earth as fast
[33:45] as possible with finding people to work
[33:47] in here because it becomes an AI race
[33:49] and everyone realizes that supply chains
[33:51] have to be re rebuilt in three to four
[33:52] years. So when we look forward, um you
[33:56] previously said that you thought stocks
[33:58] would go near or hit new all-time highs.
[34:01] Um we have seen this kind of
[34:02] acceleration. Uh do you think that with
[34:05] the Q2 economic boom, the current
[34:07] economic policies, the fact that uh Elon
[34:10] Musk is throwing the temper tantrum and
[34:11] saying, "Hey, there's no way we're going
[34:12] to be able to cut the budget. We got to
[34:13] go focus on productivity, like free walk
[34:17] to all-time highs by the end of the
[34:18] year." Well, and there's no such thing
[34:20] as a free walk. Um, it's all probability
[34:23] adjusted. There's still a chance that,
[34:25] especially with uh with Trump in office,
[34:28] anything could happen uh over the course
[34:31] of the next month. But next 24 hours.
[34:33] Exactly. But since tariffs have been the
[34:36] overhang and people the sentiment has
[34:38] not gone back up to where it was before.
[34:42] Uh and I do think the economy in the
[34:44] second half of the year where people
[34:45] still kind of are talking about
[34:46] recessions and things like that. Uh I
[34:49] think we're probably going to have a
[34:51] squeeze beforehand. So I would be
[34:54] surprised at this point if we don't get
[34:57] to new all-time highs before the end of
[34:59] the summer driven by the fact that the
[35:01] positioning is still way off base. the
[35:03] next time that I think we're probably
[35:05] going to run into some kind of problem
[35:06] and it's possible that you know like as
[35:09] an example that we don't get the bill
[35:11] through by July 4th but if we do and you
[35:14] go through the next month okay if China
[35:16] and the US can come to some agreement
[35:18] and the bill gets through and that's
[35:20] really all that h is needed we we did
[35:22] this whole rally with one deal with the
[35:23] UK nothing else has changed and yet
[35:26] people are still waiting for the next
[35:27] leg lower I believe we're about to see
[35:30] the accelerant the realization by people
[35:32] of just about how much how many benefits
[35:34] are coming from AI. The profit margin is
[35:37] the big deal. And here's the risk. Trump
[35:40] has said like in the case of Walmart, I
[35:42] expect you guys to put no prices
[35:44] through. In the bigger picture, the
[35:46] reason he says that he wants
[35:48] corporations to eat this and that would
[35:52] be a transfer from labor to from
[35:55] companies to labor. That's what he's
[35:57] hoping.
[35:59] The profit margins would be really
[36:01] interesting. Um, I think AI is going to
[36:02] do that. But what he might be squeezing
[36:04] the sausage is you guys can't raise
[36:06] prices. Okay. Well, that means our
[36:07] margins are going to go down a little.
[36:08] That means we're going to have to get
[36:09] rid of a few more people and bring AI in
[36:11] a little bit faster. That's
[36:12] unfortunately the place that we are with
[36:14] a lot of the corporations that make up
[36:16] the S&P 500. There's a race to try and
[36:19] keep your margins up at higher levels
[36:21] and benefit from AI and the fact that
[36:22] agents are coming and humanoids are
[36:24] coming. It's going to be a very
[36:26] difficult game between the work side and
[36:28] this. And that's why the government's
[36:29] just going to keep printing money. And
[36:31] I'll just keep saying it. I believe
[36:33] capital controls will be a story before
[36:36] we get through the summertime. And
[36:38] what's going to happen in that scenario?
[36:40] You think that they will just
[36:41] disincentivize any capital from leaving
[36:42] the market?
[36:44] It'll it'll cost money to people will
[36:47] have to make a decision to take money
[36:49] out. I I just I don't see how he's not
[36:52] going to continue with trying every sort
[36:55] of redistribution. And if in the China
[36:58] situation, we don't do the tariffs,
[37:00] which is kind of the pressure that's
[37:02] going, then it has to be something that,
[37:04] okay, your money's here, that's great,
[37:05] but if you're going to leave, you're
[37:07] going to have to do this. There's a
[37:08] whole bunch of things. I think it'll be
[37:10] over read as something bigger than it
[37:11] is. But I think for Bitcoin,
[37:14] anything with capital controls in the US
[37:15] is unthinkable.
[37:17] But I know most of the things, the
[37:19] people I listen to, most of the people I
[37:21] hear that are talking, they're paying
[37:23] attention to this. Hey, it was in Steven
[37:24] Mirren's paper. Hey, it's in the bill.
[37:27] Like remittances, that one's easy. But
[37:30] for investors and dividends on things,
[37:33] like it's just I think there's other
[37:35] ways to play this other than the
[37:36] tariffs. And I think this would go more
[37:38] towards hurting pension funds and stuff
[37:41] like that, less towards the sovereign
[37:42] wealth funds. And I think that's the
[37:44] route he's going to go. Yeah, it's it's
[37:46] fascinating to think through um the
[37:48] economic policies could still uh throw a
[37:50] wrench in all of this, but I do wonder
[37:53] um the taco trade. Uh has that now
[37:56] resonated? It's kind of like retail
[37:58] investors, right? Like they by by the
[37:59] dip every time there's a dip. I saw uh I
[38:01] forget who put it out. Maybe it was Adam
[38:02] Kobesci or or somebody put out um saying
[38:06] every time that we've had a down day,
[38:08] the next day in the stock market this
[38:10] year was up.36%
[38:13] on average. And uh that compared to
[38:15] historical was like 0.02%. And so what
[38:18] they were basically saying is like every
[38:19] time there's a dip retail is buying and
[38:22] you get the green the next day that is
[38:25] now like a religion right that like we
[38:27] have left any nobody's looking at
[38:28] numbers nobody's looking anything they
[38:29] see I see red I put my money in the
[38:32] market. I do wonder how much of the
[38:36] investor base both retail and
[38:38] institutional
[38:40] I don't care what the economic policies
[38:41] are. I don't care what the what's being
[38:43] announced. The single biggest
[38:46] intelligence test of our generation is
[38:48] are they gonna keep printing money? And
[38:50] if yes, buy, right? Like like that kind
[38:54] of seems where we're ending up that
[38:56] people almost don't even really pay
[38:58] attention over time. I that's why to
[39:01] bring it full circle what happened with
[39:03] Alon Musk yesterday is very symbolic of
[39:05] that whole thing which is regardless of
[39:08] what happens there will be more printing
[39:09] this year in some form some shape or
[39:11] fashion either the deficit stays at this
[39:14] level or they figure out some way again
[39:15] to help the people they're trying to
[39:17] help and I think Trump has made it
[39:19] crystal clear so if rates go higher
[39:22] which again in my opinion
[39:25] I don't think this is a panic moment but
[39:27] the housing market is a Housing
[39:29] affordability is a major problem inside
[39:32] inside the country and he needs to make
[39:35] housing more affordable if they're going
[39:37] to win the next election. Like it's a
[39:38] part of kind of what's going to go on.
[39:40] So you can stimulate growth but if rates
[39:42] go higher then we have to do something.
[39:44] And that's where this whole thing gets
[39:46] back to. You can't run away from 120% of
[39:49] debt to GDP and you can't run away from
[39:51] oh the fiscal deficit is at 7%. We'll
[39:54] get there in four years. That's not the
[39:56] way it's going to work if rates start
[39:57] moving higher. And I think that's what's
[39:59] going to happen. Yeah, I um I tend to
[40:01] agree. Let's see what happens. Um where
[40:02] can we send people to find you on the
[40:04] internet? I'm still on YouTube doing my
[40:06] weekly. I'm still on Substack doing my
[40:09] weekly. Visserlabs is attached to it. Um
[40:11] I'm posting on X. I've been real busy
[40:13] lately, so it's been less. Uh and then
[40:16] for the institutional people, um
[40:18] 22vsecurities.com,
[40:20] you can find me there. and all there I'm
[40:22] doing research papers on AI and doing a
[40:25] lot of consulting work for them for for
[40:27] asset managers for family offices on how
[40:30] do you incorporate AI into their
[40:31] business this has become a bigger thing
[40:33] for me uh
[40:36] I I know you've been involved in this
[40:37] and I'll just say this to to to finish
[40:40] this for people uh I don't think any
[40:42] decision that you make in your life now
[40:46] should be done without consulting AI
[40:49] it's a quick thing you can do it
[40:50] verbally, but it's come to the point now
[40:53] where I incorporate it in every decision
[40:55] like it's a partner of mine in terms of
[40:57] okay, I'm I'm going to go do this. What
[40:59] do you think of this idea? What am I not
[41:00] thinking about? What should I do? It is
[41:03] the more that you do that with to get
[41:05] back to people reaching out, the better
[41:07] your situation will be at work, the
[41:09] better decisions you'll make, but also
[41:11] the more that you use it as an adult,
[41:13] the more you're setting the example for
[41:14] your children. Your children need to be
[41:16] using it every single day. I think that
[41:18] uh it is the single easiest thing to
[41:22] incorporate into your life that has such
[41:24] an asymmetric impact. And uh and it's
[41:26] free. Yeah. And some people aren't going
[41:28] to do it, but that's okay. Chat GP voice
[41:31] mode. Use it. Trust me. Voice mode. Not
[41:33] the little microphone. The voice mode.
[41:36] It's free. Download the app. Have a
[41:38] conversation about any book you want
[41:40] walking down the street. It will be
[41:42] fantastic. I uh I use it for my daughter
[41:45] whenever I tell her something and she
[41:46] says that's not true and then I ask,
[41:48] right? Because I know that I can get get
[41:50] what the answer that I want. And uh it's
[41:52] fascinating how much she immediately
[41:54] defers to, oh, if the AI said it, then
[41:56] then it must be true. So, all right,
[41:58] we'll do this again next week. Thanks
[41:59] for having me.
