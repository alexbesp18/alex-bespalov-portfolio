[00:00] in order to have a stable society,
[00:01] right? The journalist asked me, you know
[00:03] what, how you would define Tether and
[00:05] the journalist told me that um he would
[00:09] define Tether as the stable coin
[00:11] company. I would define it as as as the
[00:14] stable company. So remove coin is the
[00:18] stable company company because the aim
[00:21] is helping stability of society. And so
[00:25] we realized that for for society to be
[00:27] stable, society needs stable money.
[00:31] What's going on guys? Today we have a
[00:32] very very special conversation. It's
[00:34] with Paulo Arduino. He is the CEO of
[00:37] Tether and the CTO of Bitfinex. They're
[00:39] the most profitable company per employee
[00:41] in the entire world. They did 13.7
[00:44] billion in profit last year. And now
[00:46] he's here to tell us what's going on
[00:48] with the stable coin. What exactly is
[00:50] happening with regulation in the United
[00:51] States? What are they going to do with
[00:52] 13 billion dollars of profit? They're
[00:54] investing in AI and brain computer
[00:56] interfaces and they want to see a very
[00:58] specific version of the future come to
[01:00] life. They're going to fund it and build
[01:02] it themselves. Paulo's always a great
[01:04] conversation because he is rational and
[01:06] he really understands how so much of the
[01:08] market is developing both in the
[01:10] emerging market but also in developed
[01:11] markets like the United States. And this
[01:13] conversation gives you tons of insight
[01:14] into how he's thinking about it. And
[01:16] then also he gives us an idea of what he
[01:19] thinks Tether's actually worth in terms
[01:21] of its market value. It's a big big
[01:23] number that surprised me, but I think
[01:24] that they're probably actually
[01:25] undervaluing what they've built so far.
[01:27] So here's my latest conversation with Po
[01:29] Arduino. Paulo, I thought a great place
[01:31] to start the conversation is the US
[01:33] Senate just passed the Genius Act.
[01:36] They're sending it along. Uh this is
[01:37] supposed to create a federal framework
[01:39] for stable coins. You run the biggest
[01:41] stable coin. You you're the king of the
[01:42] mountain right now. uh how do you guys
[01:44] look at the United States kind of
[01:46] leaning in on this and what do you think
[01:47] the ramifications of this bill will be
[01:48] once it is fully passed in the United
[01:50] States? Well um first of all uh thanks
[01:53] MPO for having me. Uh look I think
[01:57] everyone knows that uh US being the most
[02:00] powerful country in the world and the
[02:02] country that um is the biggest economic
[02:06] power in the world. Every other country
[02:08] is looking at the US in this moment. So
[02:11] the US passing a low for stable coins at
[02:15] the federal level is truly important
[02:17] because that will become the template
[02:18] for everyone else. So we are going to
[02:20] see and right now there are just few
[02:22] jurisdictions that are dipping their
[02:24] toes in in stable coins and crypto in
[02:26] general. But with this first the stable
[02:28] coin bill and then the market structure
[02:29] that is the comprehensive crypto bill
[02:31] that the Congress want to pass then it
[02:35] will become the blueprint for for for
[02:36] the war. So that is first of all very
[02:38] exciting. Second, I mean, being Tedar,
[02:41] the company that created the first
[02:42] stablecoin 2014,
[02:44] um 11 years in in the in the making and
[02:47] now after 11 years, we're seeing the the
[02:50] greatest country in the world uh passing
[02:52] a bill on our innovation. So, we are
[02:54] very humbled and we are very excited. Um
[02:57] so I think it's the right um way forward
[03:01] and look very honestly I saw like some
[03:04] speculations uh going around or it's
[03:07] going to be okay for tether and you know
[03:10] look uh I like this um stable coin bill
[03:14] because um it forces a lot of um um
[03:20] requirements to onshore and foreign
[03:22] stable coins and I think it's very
[03:25] egalitarian
[03:27] is creating an even playing field. It
[03:30] pushes and raised the bar very high.
[03:33] Also for a foreign stable coin like
[03:35] USDT, it has strong requirements for
[03:39] AML, strong requirements for compliance,
[03:41] stronger requirements for um reciprocity
[03:45] and comparable regimes where you know
[03:48] foreign stable coins has to be uh
[03:50] regulated and incorporated. And so that
[03:53] in my opinion is the right way to go.
[03:56] And so we are very proud. Um as I said
[03:58] uh multiple times uh Tedar is interested
[04:01] to meet the requirements and will meet
[04:04] the requirements as a foreign issuer as
[04:07] well as is looking to create a
[04:10] grassroots domestic stable coin. We
[04:11] think that we are able to create two
[04:13] different products that will serve two
[04:15] very different use cases. a super high
[04:19] efficient stable coin for a very very
[04:21] high efficiency um market like the US
[04:25] market that it has the best efficiency
[04:27] in all the financial rails in the world
[04:30] and a stable coin that is USDT that is
[04:33] the stable coin for the emerging markets
[04:34] developing countries is the stable coin
[04:36] for the people not for the institution
[04:39] not for the you know the bankers is the
[04:42] stable coin for the people so that's
[04:44] what is our aim and that's what we like
[04:47] to see from this bill. It feels like
[04:49] there was a moment in time where some US
[04:51] players were kind of targeting you guys
[04:53] and some of these things that were in
[04:54] there. Uh you guys could have, you know,
[04:56] tucked your tail between your legs and
[04:57] run off and say, "Hey, we're not going
[04:59] to the US." Uh you've been coming to the
[05:01] US a lot. You've been visiting the
[05:02] United States. You've been going to
[05:03] Washington. You've been going to uh Wall
[05:05] Street. You've been going to uh various
[05:07] uh cities. I think meeting with a lot of
[05:08] people. And it sounds like really the
[05:10] way that you guys are going to respond
[05:11] to uh the legislation is you'll continue
[05:13] to do USDT for the people as you
[05:15] mentioned, but then you also want to
[05:16] create something that is here for kind
[05:18] of the US financial system. Um, and I
[05:21] can't help but notice that like JP
[05:23] Morgan just announced the JPMD, which is
[05:26] kind of their version of a bank oriented
[05:28] or bank integrated uh alternative to
[05:30] stable coins. And so is this just a game
[05:32] where ultimately Tether with, you know,
[05:35] whatever $13 billion in profit per year
[05:37] is going to go up against the big banks
[05:39] and we're going to see who actually can
[05:40] get their dollar denominated, you know,
[05:42] kind of digital asset adopted by the
[05:44] most amount of people in the US.
[05:46] Well, I think that the banks and this
[05:49] bank consortium or JP Morgan is no
[05:52] threat to our broader business model.
[05:55] the uh foreign um stable coin USDT uh
[06:00] will remain in my opinion undisputed
[06:02] winner in um the emerging markets. U I
[06:05] don't see JP Morgan or any other bank
[06:07] from their ivory towers going and
[06:10] building adoption with the boots on the
[06:12] ground in Argentina in Turkey in in
[06:14] Vietnam in Nigeria in Kenya. We we are
[06:18] there every single day with our team. We
[06:20] are breaking our backs to build kiosks
[06:22] in Africa and we are doing education in
[06:25] bodeas in central South America with in
[06:28] in the number of hundreds of thousands.
[06:31] So that is completely far from the
[06:34] mentality of the big banks in the United
[06:37] States and in Europe for matters. But
[06:39] also you know the I like this analogy
[06:42] that you know I tried to use to to
[06:44] explain the different use cases right.
[06:46] So what you have in the US, you have to
[06:48] imagine the US as a market that has 90
[06:52] 90% perfection of and efficiency of
[06:56] financial rails. So what the US achieved
[06:58] over the last 120 years is basically
[07:01] perfection of financial rails almost
[07:02] like 90% perfection. And if you add the
[07:05] stable coins of it, you get to 95%. So
[07:09] you gain 5% more because stable coins
[07:11] are more program are programmable money.
[07:13] you can do few more things with stable
[07:15] coins that are nice to have in the
[07:17] United States and is not really you
[07:19] couldn't couldn't do it before was just
[07:21] more complex
[07:24] or less elegant to do this these things
[07:28] um with uh with without stable coins or
[07:31] without blockchain technology. If you
[07:33] take a country like Nigeria or or others
[07:37] the efficiency of the financial rails is
[07:38] 20%. If you add a stable coin it becomes
[07:42] 50%. So instead of gaining 5% like a
[07:45] United States, you would gain 30%. So
[07:48] these are completely to super different
[07:51] markets. So yeah, our competitors
[07:53] thought well you know Tedar is going to
[07:56] stay in their own small niche that by
[07:58] the way our niche counts up to three
[08:01] billion users three billion people that
[08:03] are the ones left behind by the
[08:05] financial system. So even calling them a
[08:07] niche would be extremely detrimental to
[08:10] half of the population of the world. But
[08:12] nevertheless again I think that what the
[08:15] difference between Tedar even for the US
[08:16] market the difference between Tedar and
[08:18] the big banks is that we understand what
[08:22] people want. Even in the US you have uh
[08:25] people that are in have basic income and
[08:28] part of the working class that are not
[08:31] the the riches that can afford you know
[08:33] or can cannot be served or boarded
[08:36] necessarily by JP Morgan. And so that is
[08:39] our market right. We understand the
[08:41] normal people very well, better than
[08:43] anyone else. When you think about uh
[08:46] kind of those individuals, uh there
[08:48] really seems to be two use cases for the
[08:50] US dollar, right? People want to pay for
[08:51] things, people want to hold them. We
[08:53] know that just changing the technology
[08:55] form factor, kind of the wrapper around
[08:56] the dollar, doesn't change the
[08:58] debasement rate, doesn't change the
[08:59] inflation rate, uh kind of any of those
[09:01] things. And so, what are you guys seeing
[09:03] when it comes to uh these individuals
[09:05] portfolios or kind of the different
[09:07] currencies they use? Are they using
[09:08] dollars to spend and then they're
[09:10] holding like Bitcoin for savings? Are
[09:12] they are they trying to get gold or you
[09:13] know I know you guys have tether gold
[09:15] like talk a little bit as to what the
[09:17] dollar is being used for and then what
[09:18] are they supplementing the rest of their
[09:20] financial life with as a way to protect
[09:22] themselves from that debasement or
[09:23] inflation.
[09:25] Look, um, when it comes to USDT, 37% of
[09:29] the users of USDT are using USDT as a
[09:32] savings account because if you live in
[09:34] Turkey, if you live in Nigeria, if you
[09:35] live in Argentina, your national
[09:37] currencies devaluating at the pace that
[09:39] is incredible, is um insane against the
[09:42] the US dollar. So, it's normal for for
[09:45] the people the the most the well the
[09:48] wide user base of of USDT to use it as
[09:52] their savings account. Of course the the
[09:55] richer the country or the wealthier is
[09:57] the person then it might use USDT as um
[10:02] a checking account. Now uh we believe
[10:05] that there is a space for and by the way
[10:07] Tedar does a lot of Bitcoin education
[10:09] for example when we go in all the
[10:11] emerging markets first we explain
[10:13] Bitcoin and then we talk about stable
[10:15] coins. Unfortunately, in the emerging
[10:18] markets especially, you have still
[10:20] people that have urgencies. They have
[10:23] priorities in their lives, right? So,
[10:25] they're not rich people. And again, they
[10:27] live in a country where the inflation is
[10:30] 70% year-over-year. So, they have bigger
[10:33] problems than trying to understand what
[10:35] would what is Bitcoin. That of course to
[10:38] all of us Bitcoin is the best currency
[10:40] in the world is the biggest creation in
[10:42] financial industry. But requires a level
[10:44] understanding that not necessarily is
[10:46] everyone is ready to undergo and um and
[10:51] they might not have the time but they
[10:53] know the dollar right so they have been
[10:54] knowing the dollar for the last decades
[10:56] and using the dollar in form of cash
[10:58] bills for the last decade decades and so
[11:02] that's what they ask first they ask okay
[11:04] can you give me uh stable coin can you
[11:06] give me USDT teach me how to use USDT
[11:09] and then that is the pathway to get them
[11:11] on on Bitcoin and when it comes to gold
[11:14] also the the common denominator of
[11:16] emerging markets is the um appreciation
[11:19] of gold right gold has been the currency
[11:21] of the world for the last 5,000 years
[11:24] and um India and a lot of countries in
[11:27] Africa and other many countries in Asia
[11:29] um and and Middle East are have been
[11:31] using gold as a as a form of of savings
[11:34] as well. So we are seeing recently an
[11:37] uptake also given the fact that the gold
[11:39] price went almost 2x or actually more
[11:41] than 2x in the last u two year and a
[11:43] half or 3 years then we're seeing an
[11:45] uptaking of interest of um tar gold in
[11:48] this moment tar gold is the interest is
[11:51] more for uh from um hedge funds and
[11:54] professional traders that are looking at
[11:57] using it as their um reserve or or
[12:00] collateral because honestly would be a
[12:02] better collateral than any fiat
[12:04] currency. including also the dollar,
[12:07] right? So they're looking at at least
[12:09] diversifying their portfolio when it
[12:10] comes to their savings portfolio or
[12:13] their collateral portfolio with Tedar
[12:16] gold. But also we are seeing um higher
[12:18] uptake from the retail that are you know
[12:21] they retail has been use buying paper
[12:24] gold a lot recently and the beauty of
[12:28] Tedar gold is that we have physical gold
[12:31] in a vault owned by Tedar and controlled
[12:34] by Tedar. Uh now we hold between Tether
[12:37] Gold and Tether own gold reserves. We
[12:39] have more than well around the 80 tons
[12:42] of of gold of physical gold held in
[12:44] Switzerland. So you know it's not your
[12:46] vault not your gold like not your keys
[12:49] not your coins is pretty much our
[12:50] philosophy.
[12:52] I have heard that uh you guys have the
[12:54] physical gold and there have been times
[12:56] where they have been counted and to make
[12:58] sure that you got exactly what you need
[12:59] right and uh and verified and things
[13:01] like that which um talk a little bit
[13:03] about the attestations that you guys put
[13:05] uh recently I was talking to someone and
[13:06] they were asking me all about you know
[13:08] where's the money go and and I said well
[13:10] look here's a website and uh the
[13:11] breakdown I think has gotten much better
[13:13] over time it's got a lot more
[13:14] granularity to it uh but but just maybe
[13:16] talk about the idea of putting it out
[13:18] there and then also like how you think
[13:20] about allocating what those reserves
[13:22] actually are.
[13:24] So um the reserves are predominantly in
[13:27] US treasuries and then we have a bit of
[13:30] gold and a bit of Bitcoin but uh we have
[13:33] um strong overcolateralization. So Tedar
[13:37] um USDT the market cap is around $155
[13:40] billion. Um we have um around 125
[13:45] billion uh dollars in US treasuries plus
[13:48] we have gold and bitcoin and we have an
[13:50] over collateralization just for the
[13:53] stable coin of um around 6 to7 billion.
[13:56] Now we are you know running up to the
[13:58] end of the quarter. So we are going to
[14:00] do the the updated calculations but we
[14:02] are keeping uh several billion dollars
[14:05] more than the 100% reserves that we need
[14:09] to keep in order to fulfill uh of all
[14:12] the redemptions. That's because we don't
[14:14] want to be like a bank. Banks do 90 up
[14:17] to 90% of um fractional reserve u they
[14:21] only keep 10% in liquid assets. We want
[14:24] to keep more than 100% in liquid assets
[14:27] among which the vast vast vast majority
[14:29] is US treasuries shortterm and plus the
[14:32] entire uh terror group has give or take
[14:35] another 15 to 16 billion
[14:38] uh in excess. So that you know overall
[14:42] the entire group has an equity of
[14:46] 176 billion um in front of 155 billion
[14:52] as a market cap of USDT. So that is very
[14:54] unprecedented as uh in in the financial
[14:57] industry. That's what make us I think
[14:59] very different. Now we are very proud to
[15:01] to release um a quarterly stationation
[15:04] that is done by BDO that is um the fifth
[15:08] largest auditor in the world. Um the
[15:11] station is the industry standard is um
[15:14] is is very thorough and independently
[15:16] verified. So uh Bo does a very good job
[15:19] in in in independently verifying our
[15:21] reserves. you're right, the gold as well
[15:23] is being checked um weighted and they
[15:26] you know pass through this scanner um so
[15:30] they they make sure it's not tungsten
[15:32] and um yeah so I think that transparency
[15:35] is is um is key and what I like about
[15:38] the genius act is that the requirements
[15:40] of transparency either you are domestic
[15:43] or foreign are very strong so that you
[15:46] know you cannot have another teruna that
[15:50] hides behind the finger and call itself
[15:52] a stable coin. What do you think about
[15:55] the Circle IPO? You know, we've seen
[15:56] Circle obviously uh come out of the gate
[15:58] and explode. I saw somebody trying to
[16:00] break down uh the financials of Tether
[16:03] and say, "Well, if Tether was a public
[16:04] company, given these uh financials and
[16:07] kind of the way the market is treated,
[16:08] you guys basically be worth a gazillion
[16:09] dollars. This would be, you know, crazy
[16:11] how how valuable Tether would be." How
[16:14] do you look at that? And you know, would
[16:15] you ever be tempted to take Tether
[16:17] public or or just talk a little bit as
[16:19] to, you know, kind of you're getting
[16:20] updated information from the market on
[16:22] how they're treating the second largest
[16:24] stable coin? I got to imagine that you
[16:26] guys are thinking, you know, internally.
[16:27] Does that change anything that you guys
[16:28] are doing either in the financing of
[16:30] your company going public or maybe even
[16:31] how you operate?
[16:33] Well, first of all, we're very excited
[16:36] to see that multiplier. So I think that
[16:40] someone put out an analysis saying that
[16:42] you know with a conservative multiplier
[16:45] ter would be worth $500 billion and I
[16:47] said that is very conservative in in uh
[16:50] with all due respect because you know
[16:52] with the the same multiplier that um
[16:54] that circle has plus the fact that we
[16:57] have gold and bitcoin has reserves plus
[16:59] the fact that we have and we own our
[17:02] distribution network. we don't have to
[17:04] pay the distribution network like a vast
[17:07] majority of our profits then terror with
[17:10] the same multiplier would be worth $2
[17:11] trillion. So you know that is a nice
[17:14] number. Now we are not interested to go
[17:17] public um especially given the fact that
[17:20] the company is very profitable and this
[17:22] year we think we could beat last year
[17:24] profits. Um then you know why why going
[17:29] public? Because look um there are two
[17:32] reasons why people well why companies
[17:34] want to go public. The first one is
[17:36] access to cheap capital and in $13.7
[17:40] billion last year and you know I would
[17:42] imagine similar numbers or higher
[17:44] numbers this year you know I it's very
[17:47] hard to to spend all that money. You
[17:49] know we have great projects and very
[17:51] high ambitions but you know again we are
[17:54] very conservative in the way we manage
[17:56] the company. We don't have uh you know
[17:59] dozens of of of employees. We have very
[18:02] highly professional selected number of
[18:03] employees that are great. They they work
[18:05] very hard and are the best in class. And
[18:08] also we have um uh we have lean
[18:11] operations. We have we are reinvesting
[18:14] most of what we we earn in in safe
[18:18] assets uh like gold and bitcoin. But
[18:20] also we are doing we have a very strong
[18:22] investment arm that is investing in in
[18:25] new technologies like biotech,
[18:27] artificial intelligence and um
[18:29] telecommunications even land and
[18:31] agriculture because we think that is the
[18:34] ultimate stability of the world because
[18:35] society will always need land and
[18:37] agriculture. So we have all that. So we
[18:39] don't need access to capital and also
[18:42] most importantly I don't need we don't
[18:45] need an exit right we are going we we I
[18:48] feel like tether is one year old is not
[18:50] 11 years old is is we I feel like we
[18:52] just started we we can create the
[18:54] greatest company in the world we are
[18:56] super excited every single day we wake
[18:58] up even more excited than the day before
[19:00] and um that's something that um is a
[19:04] strong testament to to everyone in the
[19:05] company. So yeah, no, we we are not
[19:08] going to be public. Actually, funny
[19:09] fact, um I took a photo. I I did a great
[19:13] interview. I think it was great uh with
[19:15] the New York Stock Exchange. Um I think
[19:18] um you know, a few months ago and then I
[19:20] went walked out from from that hall and
[19:23] I I I look at the bull. I took a selfie
[19:27] and basically I I posted a picture
[19:29] saying Tanner does not need to go public
[19:31] because again we don't need the money
[19:32] and we don't plan to do an exit. and my
[19:36] interview was removed from from the New
[19:38] York Stock Exchange website. That was
[19:40] hilarious. Um so but look we are we are
[19:43] simple people even if you know we not
[19:45] necessarily the establishment likes us
[19:47] in as establishment talking the big
[19:49] strong all the finance uh the finance
[19:52] world I we don't care right so we we
[19:55] don't want to live quarter by quarter
[19:57] trying to please a couple of analysts
[19:59] from JP Morgan why I mean we have a
[20:02] beautiful business and we are helping
[20:04] hundreds of millions of people speaking
[20:07] of uh maybe the incumbent financial
[20:09] system uh one organization that loves
[20:11] you guys is Caner Fitzgerald. Um, you
[20:14] obviously have a a great relationship.
[20:17] Um, it started with Howard Leticer team.
[20:20] Now, Brandon Leticum I think you guys
[20:23] are very close with and and it seems
[20:25] like Tether and Caner have this kind of
[20:27] symbiotic thing where they were very
[20:29] helpful to you all in terms of helping
[20:31] to uh attest to the the reserves and
[20:33] things like that early on. Uh, but also
[20:35] I think as you guys have started to do
[20:37] more things in the United States, they
[20:38] seem to be helpful there. talk a little
[20:39] bit about that relationship and maybe
[20:41] Howard, Brandon, and the rest of the
[20:42] team. Today's episode is brought to you
[20:45] by Maple, the go-to place for onchain
[20:47] asset management. There aren't many

[22:38] today. Talk a little bit about that
[22:39] relationship and maybe Howard, Brandon,
[22:41] and the rest of the team.
[22:43] Well, um, Caner is, I would say, the
[22:47] first institution that that took Bitcoin
[22:49] very seriously. We, um, we had the
[22:52] opportunity to meet them, um, very early
[22:55] on, a few years ago when they were
[22:58] looking at all the different players in
[22:59] the industry and they found ourselves
[23:02] um, in they found ourselves uh, very
[23:06] interesting. But first they wanted to
[23:08] understand and get the answer to the
[23:11] biggest question around tether that
[23:13] circulated. Do we have actually the
[23:16] money? So they did two years of very
[23:20] strong due diligence. They turned every
[23:21] single rock and the more time was
[23:24] passing they was like they were like all
[23:26] right these guys must have the money
[23:27] because they everything that they say is
[23:29] there. And uh you know that that uh in
[23:33] the end uh um ended up with um Howard
[23:36] Latnik going public in um early 2024
[23:40] with a statement they have the money uh
[23:44] proving and saying that you know money
[23:47] the the all the T bills are in
[23:49] counterfeit Gerald and um you know like
[23:52] vast vast majority of the tables are in
[23:54] counterfeit Gerald and they they you
[23:56] know they are in on on US soil that is
[23:58] the other thing right. So lot of um
[24:01] there is still a lot of f a lot of um
[24:04] misinformation like around terror. We
[24:07] keep our reserves with our treasuries in
[24:12] the United States. If we were a company
[24:14] that wanted to hide, would we keep 120
[24:17] plus billion dollars in the most or one
[24:20] of the most regulated financial
[24:22] institutions in the United States? that
[24:25] is like you know the when you hear this
[24:27] stuff I I I think people don't open X or
[24:30] don't open you know our website or don't
[24:33] don't read since 2017 because you know
[24:36] they're clearly stuck to the old fashion
[24:38] of FOD because now um I think that
[24:41] everyone that that uh has a bit of brain
[24:44] and can read and is looking around can
[24:47] see that first of all given the
[24:49] profitability tether given the fact that
[24:50] we keep our money in the United States
[24:52] we have been scrutinized by so many
[24:54] regulators, the New York Attorney
[24:56] General and so many others. We have been
[24:58] on boarded and scrutinized by even
[25:00] counter and so that is that was um you
[25:04] know I I think a strong result plus I
[25:07] think that the counter now is
[25:08] positioning itself as uh the leader in
[25:11] space when it comes to Bitcoin products.
[25:13] They announced like uh Bitcoin lending.
[25:16] they announced um um a product that is
[25:20] um you know a fund that is uh a fund
[25:23] that allows um people companies go long
[25:26] bitcoin but with downside protection
[25:28] with gold. So there there are I I think
[25:32] that they are uh very good in in
[25:33] understanding the space and very very
[25:35] committed and I I'm proud to be to have
[25:37] participated to their orange peeling. I
[25:40] uh I loved that uh they uh they did two
[25:43] years of due diligence and I remember
[25:44] when Howard Lutton came out and said
[25:45] they got the money and everyone was like
[25:47] wait what like that's not a Bitcoiner
[25:49] saying that right that's somebody who uh
[25:51] if he's saying that he either really
[25:52] really believes or he's going to look
[25:54] very bad after the fact and so I think
[25:56] that was a kind of a seminal moment um
[25:58] but but also I think that you've worked
[25:59] with a lot of other organizations most
[26:01] recently uh the department of justice uh
[26:04] basically came out and said that you
[26:05] guys helped them um if I understand this
[26:07] correctly it's like a $225 million
[26:10] dollar uh case, but it's around pig
[26:12] butchering. Is that right? Yeah. Yeah,
[26:15] it's right. It's crazy, right? So, it's,
[26:17] you know, it's a romance scam. It's like
[26:21] uh nice Well, nice girls could be now
[26:24] generated with AI. I don't know. I mean,
[26:25] but you know, maybe there is a like
[26:27] there is a an old dude behind them, but
[26:30] you know, sending messages to to to guys
[26:33] and basically asking them for money and
[26:35] guys basically sending these these girls
[26:38] some money and crazy thing is that they
[26:41] they were able to to to get $225 million
[26:45] out of this. And there is a a huge
[26:48] misconception around it. So you know I I
[26:50] was talking to some journalists and they
[26:52] were like oh that means that you know
[26:55] these criminals are using USDT and you
[26:57] know a lot and I was like no that is
[27:00] actually the the wrong way to look at
[27:02] it. The right way to look at it is that
[27:04] tbachering is not stealing USDT from the
[27:08] people. What happens is that who pro who
[27:12] is the criminals are asking for the
[27:15] money. The money is being sent through
[27:17] credit cards and debit cards or or you
[27:20] know other like uh payment apps to
[27:23] payment processors that these payment
[27:26] processors or from bank accounts. What
[27:28] what mentors they are the the money is
[27:31] first sent to payment processor then is
[27:33] moved on an exchange and then is moved
[27:35] maybe on a crypto exchange and then is
[27:36] moved to USDT. when it gets to USDT, we
[27:39] freeze it. So for three times, two or
[27:42] for two or three times, traditional
[27:45] financial systems fail to freeze and to
[27:48] recognize the the the scam and to freeze
[27:51] the money. They failed that. And when it
[27:53] comes to USDT, when it gets converted to
[27:55] USDT and goes on chain, we can recognize
[27:58] the patterns because for the last 11
[28:00] years, we developed the best monitoring
[28:02] technology and then we proceed to
[28:05] freezing. So all the noise about you
[28:08] know cryptocurrencies and stable coins
[28:09] used for criminal activity is actually
[28:12] stable coins and USDT is the worst are
[28:16] the worst tool for for criminals because
[28:18] criminals will be caught and money will
[28:19] be frozen. When you think about uh users
[28:23] of USDT one of the things to me that uh
[28:26] becomes really interesting is um by
[28:29] having a public blockchain you now have
[28:32] access to that information. And you're
[28:33] talking about a law enforcement use case
[28:35] here. Are there things that you think
[28:37] you can do whether it's generating
[28:39] analytics, whether it's measuring
[28:40] inflation, whether it's, you know,
[28:42] measuring an economy or or other things
[28:44] that you can start to do as you get
[28:45] access to more and more information on
[28:46] chain. Like I've always been fascinated
[28:48] with this idea that um you know, we know
[28:50] that the uh Fed and the Bureau of Labor
[28:53] Statistics like they're horrible with
[28:54] the data. They're looking at backwards
[28:56] looking information. They're trying to
[28:57] tell you what's going to happen in the
[28:58] future by telling you what happened in
[29:00] like February with inflation. But right
[29:02] now, Stripe or uh Square or maybe like a
[29:05] Zillow or you know any of these sites,
[29:07] they have real-time information. You all
[29:10] maybe more so than almost anyone in the
[29:11] world have real-time information of
[29:13] payments and and uh kind of what people
[29:14] are doing with money. Have you guys
[29:17] started to kind of explore what exactly
[29:19] is is valuable there?
[29:22] Well, yes. So we we are creating an
[29:25] internal dashboard to understand exactly
[29:29] how USDT is being used and that
[29:31] dashboard is the one that allows us to
[29:33] understand that 37% of USD holders are
[29:37] holding USDT as a savings account. We we
[29:40] understand the time zones where USDT is
[29:43] being sent the most. We understand the
[29:45] service providers that are using most
[29:46] USDT.
[29:48] So that's how we could get to
[29:51] understanding that now we have around 4
[29:53] 450 million users and the growth of
[29:55] number of wallets per quarter is around
[29:58] 30 million new wallets and so that is
[30:01] almost like Facebook Facebook level of
[30:03] growth. So look I I think that data is
[30:07] is fundamental for for a business like
[30:09] because with data we can automate a lot.
[30:12] We can we are starting to implement
[30:14] through our QAC AI platform. We are also
[30:17] thinking how we can leverage all the
[30:19] data that we are collecting from
[30:20] blockchains to try to understand our
[30:22] business better in a certain way like
[30:25] the the you know the the fact that
[30:27] became so popular without us having even
[30:29] a marketing team you have sometimes to
[30:32] go back and look in retrospect and
[30:34] understand how why it happened and what
[30:37] made made it great and so that's what we
[30:40] are doing through this platform we are
[30:41] going back in the entire history of
[30:43] Tedar and trying to to pair it every
[30:45] single
[30:47] um increase or decrease of the monetary
[30:49] supply um type two event geopolitical
[30:53] local event and so on and trying to link
[30:55] it to time zones link it to different
[30:57] service providers and so that is
[31:00] extremely helpful so I I think that it's
[31:02] going to be the foundation for our
[31:04] future growth um you know we are we are
[31:07] now um starting to use these tools to
[31:09] understand how commodity traders are
[31:11] using USD that I believe is going to be
[31:13] the biggest game changanger for the
[31:15] growth that are in the next few years.
[31:17] Explain that more. What why the
[31:18] commodity traders?
[31:20] So if you're a commodity trader um you
[31:24] do oil deals. Imagine like you want to
[31:26] buy some oil and trade oil. What happens
[31:29] is that you you have a ship waiting to
[31:33] load barrels of oil in some dock and
[31:36] then the ship cannot start loading the
[31:38] barrels of oil until the the wire hits
[31:42] uh the bank account of the seller. And
[31:44] uh that can take 1 day, 3 days, 7 days.
[31:48] You know, there there the slowness is
[31:51] incredible even for huge commodity
[31:53] trading firms. We're talking to the
[31:54] biggest all the biggest commodity
[31:56] trading firms and they all report the
[31:58] same. And so you know they they suddenly
[32:01] discover USDT and they think that is the
[32:03] best thing after sliced bread because
[32:06] then for them they all know that in all
[32:09] the emerging markets in all basically
[32:11] most of the countries where they're used
[32:12] to to to do trades and send dollars they
[32:16] can send USD because USDT there is
[32:18] accepted by the population because those
[32:20] are exactly the countries that are using
[32:21] USDT as their savings accounts. So then
[32:25] they know that the seller is
[32:26] incentivized to um to to obtain USDT as
[32:30] a payment because it's faster and so
[32:32] they can the efficiency of money for the
[32:34] commodity traders is higher. The seller
[32:36] is happier because gets the money sooner
[32:38] and also the salaries knows that can
[32:41] also use USDT locally and to pay
[32:44] salaries to the population and all that
[32:45] because USD is accepted as a normal
[32:48] currency. Look at Bolivia. I mean,
[32:50] Bolivia posted a tweet like in the in in
[32:53] Bolivian shops in in Santa Cruz people
[32:55] and the the you know tags of the price
[32:58] tags are USD. That happens all the time
[33:01] in many many countries and many many
[33:03] cities
[33:04] when you think about how this stuff
[33:07] starts to play out. Um do you foresee a
[33:09] world where Tether is integrated into
[33:13] the stock market? Like for example,
[33:15] rather than using the electronic
[33:17] dollars, uh I want to sell a stock and I
[33:19] literally sit in Tether or I pull
[33:21] withdraw money from the stock market in
[33:23] Tether like how how deep into the
[33:25] traditional financial system can you
[33:27] push this versus do you have to build a
[33:29] parallel system and you say hey look we
[33:31] got to go build a whole new stock
[33:33] exchange we got to go build a whole new
[33:34] you know kind of payment system and then
[33:36] we'll put uh tether into that world.
[33:40] So I think that um you know consortium
[33:43] banks will trying to cover the first use
[33:45] case that you described um and honestly
[33:48] that will be basically a tokenized money
[33:51] market fund because you know traders
[33:54] especially from the traditional board
[33:55] they are used to such a high efficiency
[33:58] of money um having clearing houses and
[34:01] all that that um it's are you know
[34:03] always at their disposal that they you
[34:06] know it will just improve the the effic
[34:09] efficiency a little bit as I said from
[34:11] 90% to 95%.
[34:14] So what I believe that is going to but
[34:16] you know focusing on that use case will
[34:20] not improve 90% of the the rest of the
[34:22] population. So you know 3 4 billion
[34:25] people are living in different
[34:26] conditions. They are the ones that
[34:28] cannot access to the to the to to the
[34:31] traditional markets. They they need
[34:34] different tools. they need tools then
[34:36] they they they they leap forward 30
[34:39] years of of of technology and will use
[34:42] daxes on chain they will use stable
[34:44] coins and all that so actually it's the
[34:48] emerging markets that will need a
[34:50] parallel financial system still you know
[34:53] are subject to regulations again the the
[34:56] the genius art is a great first example
[34:59] but you know this will bring new
[35:02] opportunities to the people that need it
[35:03] the most I don't I think you know the
[35:05] you know the the the the traders that
[35:08] are used to one nanocond
[35:11] um um efficiency for trading will you
[35:17] know benefit incredibly much from a
[35:19] stable coin but if you live in Nigeria
[35:22] and want to have access to a stock
[35:24] market for example that is game changer
[35:27] and when you start to see kind of uh the
[35:30] profits that you guys are generating
[35:32] obviously it's a lot 13.7 billion last
[35:34] here just a couple of pennies. Um you
[35:36] are investing in all kinds of things as
[35:39] a diversification strategy. Um but
[35:41] they're not just things where you're
[35:43] going and saying, "Hey, let's go buy,
[35:44] you know, a car wash. You guys are
[35:46] investing in AI. You're investing in
[35:48] brain computer interfaces. You're
[35:49] investing in humanoid stuff. You're
[35:51] doing, you know, computational power. I
[35:53] mean, like the things you're doing are
[35:54] the future. Uh regardless of who the
[35:56] individual winners are, like the trends
[35:58] are where the world is headed. talk
[36:00] about the philosophy there and maybe
[36:01] some of the projects that you guys are
[36:03] heavily involved with. Maybe we talk
[36:04] about QVAC and then I know that the uh
[36:06] brain computer interface is maybe one of
[36:08] the things that you spend the most time
[36:09] thinking about.
[36:11] So today's episode is brought to you by

[37:02] solution, Polka Dot seems to be the top
[37:04] choice for industry players. Go check
[37:06] them out today at polka dot.com. We are
[37:09] being in this lucky situation. Um, we
[37:12] are carefully planning how to we use our
[37:14] profits and being Bitcoiners at heart.
[37:18] um you know we we created this um this
[37:22] uh basically almost an equation that
[37:26] says that uh in order to have a stable
[37:28] society right the journalist asked me
[37:30] you know what how you would define
[37:32] tether and the journalist told me that
[37:35] um he would define tether as the stable
[37:38] coin company and I replied I would
[37:41] define it as as as the stable company so
[37:46] remove coin is the stable
[37:48] company company because the aim is
[37:51] helping stability of society. And so we
[37:54] realize that for for society to be
[37:57] stable, society needs stable money. That
[38:01] you know for for emerging markets,
[38:02] stable money can be used be USDT because
[38:05] their existing solution is not that
[38:09] stable at least compared to USDT. So
[38:12] everything is relative. Of course, you
[38:13] could say that stable money for for um
[38:17] for the US could be gold or bitcoin, but
[38:20] for Nigeria or for for Turkey, stable
[38:22] money is USD.
[38:24] Then the second thing would be so this
[38:27] equation is is four-fold. The second
[38:29] part would be uh freedom of speech and
[38:31] the freedom of communications. And so we
[38:33] are trying to do that with Keith and
[38:35] whole punch creating peer-to-peer
[38:37] communications with a great user
[38:38] experience that is basically equal to or
[38:41] superior to a normal centralized system
[38:43] but completely undisruptable uh
[38:46] completely unstoppable completely free
[38:48] for everyone. Right? So that is the
[38:50] second layer. The third one is stable
[38:54] energy. So um you need to for a stable
[38:57] society you need to have uh egalitarian
[38:59] access to electricity. So um electricity
[39:03] brings to education brings to a lot of
[39:05] things of course it's is very obvious.
[39:07] So we are even in Africa we are trying
[39:09] to help with stable electricity or
[39:12] energy through these kiosks that we're
[39:14] building uh with solar panels on top and
[39:16] batteries inside. We are selling
[39:18] subscription to rechargeable batteries.
[39:20] We did a pilot with 500 kiosks now in
[39:22] small um small villages in Africa and we
[39:26] have now you know 500 k around 500,000
[39:29] um subscribers already and we did more
[39:33] than 10 million battery swaps. So that
[39:36] is that is the pilot but by 2026 we're
[39:39] going to have 10,000 kiosks and by 2030
[39:42] we're going to have 100,000 kiosks. So
[39:44] that is stable energy. It's like
[39:45] decentralized energy. So you don't have,
[39:48] you know, you have uh you bring the
[39:49] energy source clo closer to to to the
[39:52] user. That's what we like about, you
[39:54] know, Bitcoin, right? And what we like
[39:56] about peer-to-peer telecommunications,
[39:58] like bringing the ownership and the
[40:00] control, but basically closer to the
[40:01] person, closer to the user. The last one
[40:04] is stable intelligence. And so stable
[40:08] intelligence means an intelligence that
[40:10] is um controlled and owned by the person
[40:14] and not by a big corporation. So my my
[40:17] fe theor is I I made made this this
[40:19] analogy with the kazio calculator right
[40:23] when I was a kid when I was in
[40:24] elementary school we were forced to do
[40:26] all the multiplication division uh
[40:28] additions uh with mind with our mind so
[40:33] to train our mind and become fast and
[40:35] being able to be to quickly multiply and
[40:38] divide and all that. Now most of the
[40:40] people um they are so used to use
[40:43] calculators that they cannot even for a
[40:45] small uh addition they will not do it by
[40:47] mind they will do it on the calculator
[40:50] and so imagine for a simple case like
[40:53] calculations how calculators what
[40:55] calculators made to the ability of
[40:57] people to calculate in their mind.
[40:59] Imagine what AI could do to the human
[41:03] brain if basically AI will do all the
[41:05] thinking or most of the thinking. And so
[41:07] at least the concept of not your coins,
[41:11] not uh not not your keys, not your coins
[41:14] and not your um vault, not your gold
[41:16] should be applied to the intelligence.
[41:18] So not not your AI, not your
[41:20] intelligence is kind of our motto. So we
[41:23] want to build a peer-to-peer AI platform
[41:25] that uh allows to do inference and uh
[41:28] keep the data of the users directly
[41:30] local to the people's devices. So with
[41:34] um it can run on a $30 smartphone can
[41:36] run basically everywhere. it adapts of
[41:38] course the more power the better it will
[41:40] be the model that is going to be using
[41:42] the more weights is going to be used
[41:43] from the model and all that right but
[41:45] that is my opinion a way to ensure that
[41:49] um AI will not increase the gap uh of of
[41:53] access to education and access to
[41:56] intelligence between different
[41:58] populations already money is a huge um
[42:01] divider and I think that AI could
[42:04] multiply that divider by 100x if we on
[42:07] to create something that again is
[42:09] peer-to-peer from the get-go. We cannot
[42:11] live in a future where only three
[42:12] companies will become the will have the
[42:15] entire intelligence of the board. And so
[42:18] that's something that Tether fortunately
[42:20] has the balance sheet to fight against
[42:22] and to build a different alternative
[42:24] system. We did it already once with
[42:26] money and we're going to do it again
[42:27] with intelligence. When you think about
[42:29] the future of Tether 20 years from now,
[42:32] 30 years from now, you're you're a young
[42:33] guy, you know, good-looking Italian. Um,
[42:35] only second best looking one on this uh
[42:37] call here, but uh good-looking Italian.
[42:40] Um, what what is the vision for this,
[42:42] right? I mean, you you have solved one
[42:44] of the problems that is very difficult
[42:46] for people who have high ambition and uh
[42:48] who have unique thoughts of the world,
[42:50] which is you have the capital that
[42:52] profit is an engine that you can use to
[42:54] go after some of these big ideas. Is it
[42:56] something where you know um Elon's got
[43:00] everything from rockets to electric
[43:02] vehicles to brain computer interface
[43:03] like he's trying to build the future and
[43:04] you guys aspire to be much more than
[43:06] just the stable coin or is there some
[43:09] other future vision that you really see
[43:10] for the Tether group uh that people
[43:12] should kind of keep in mind as we watch
[43:14] this play out over the next couple
[43:15] decades?
[43:17] Well, I think that um it might be um
[43:20] counterintuitive, but my dream is to
[43:23] create a company that builds technology
[43:26] that can survive to the death of the
[43:28] company itself, right? We we exceeded
[43:31] our dreams with the with the
[43:34] profitability of this company and
[43:35] personally and all that, right? So, you
[43:38] know, we even like Tedar only
[43:40] distributed less than 5% of the profits
[43:42] that he made in from from inception. So
[43:45] all the rest is is is kept in the
[43:47] company to invest in great
[43:49] opportunities, great companies, great
[43:51] minds to build but with one mission to
[43:54] build a decentralized future that is
[43:57] bringing control and power closes closer
[44:00] to the person. Uh we want I want to
[44:03] build technology that not even tar can
[44:06] control. I want if we build a
[44:08] communication app, I want people to
[44:10] control the communication app to to have
[44:11] the data local to have I want that
[44:15] communication app to survive even even
[44:17] eye or tether dies right that is the
[44:20] beauty I think that is the ultimate goal
[44:22] of what we're building is to to create
[44:24] that the same with AI the same with
[44:26] everything else right so we want to do
[44:28] things that um are resistant to the
[44:30] wrath of god hence they they should
[44:32] survive to whatever happens including
[44:34] tether disappearing so only at that
[44:37] point I know that we have done a very
[44:39] good job.
[44:41] What is your personal mission still?
[44:44] What what is the thing that you haven't
[44:45] accomplished yet outside of the company?
[44:47] Like we know the company as you just
[44:48] described, but for you personally like
[44:50] what what is motivating you? What is the
[44:52] thing that you're still driving towards?
[44:57] I mean my my my dream is really linked
[44:59] to to to the company sense that I
[45:04] I think that we I think that my myself I
[45:07] can build
[45:10] with with our team this vision of of uh
[45:15] ensuring that in the worst case scenario
[45:18] the thing that I hate the most is
[45:20] technology is only working we we are so
[45:24] immersed in technology today and that
[45:26] technology only works in the best case
[45:28] scenario. I mean in these last days you
[45:31] have you might have heard of this little
[45:34] thing as the World War II that was
[45:36] airing around and I can guarantee you
[45:39] that in that case if that truly happens
[45:42] most of the technology that we we have
[45:44] in our pockets will stop working
[45:47] because internet lines will be cut and
[45:49] so technology should be more local
[45:52] should be able to work in the worst case
[45:54] scenario should be able to work with
[45:56] latency that is one day or one
[45:59] Most of the applications don't work if
[46:01] latency is higher than 1 second and
[46:05] there are timeouts of technology that is
[46:08] every single
[46:10] SDK or library for coding has a timeout
[46:12] of 30 seconds. So if you cannot get a
[46:15] connection for 30 seconds everything
[46:16] starts to fail. How crazy is that? But
[46:19] if we are living in a disaster scenario
[46:22] we need to be able to have technology
[46:23] that works locally first. That's my
[46:27] mission is actually to prove that you
[46:29] can build great technology that is human
[46:31] first is persons first is peer first and
[46:35] can survive to the worst case scenarios
[46:38] but even if we are going to a
[46:40] multilanetary uh life what is the
[46:43] latency between here and the moon what
[46:45] is the latency between here and Mars so
[46:47] we need to be able to have that type of
[46:49] technology and that's what we are
[46:51] building with whole punch with our AI
[46:53] platform with everything else is a a
[46:56] future where doesn't matter if you are
[46:58] close or far everything will keep
[47:00] working the and you are going to be
[47:02] protected by the by by your technology
[47:04] and everything will be open even with a
[47:06] brain computer interface company we want
[47:08] to build an open source brain operating
[47:10] system so that people will have full
[47:13] control over their own lives that is my
[47:15] life mission um you know it all started
[47:18] for me when I've been a coder all my
[47:20] life I started when I was eight and I
[47:23] know I've been a sci-fi I fan that is
[47:25] driving all most of my thoughts. I
[47:28] always think about like sci-fi and event
[47:30] sci-fi eventually will become true and
[47:32] so so it means that eventually will
[47:35] hit the fan and I want to be able to
[47:37] build for that scenario and uh I did I
[47:40] was researcher in this group that was um
[47:43] building a telecommunication network for
[47:45] for disaster scenarios like from the
[47:47] apocalyptic scenario or a battlefield
[47:50] and if you are like a person in a
[47:52] battlefield
[47:53] you know you have you need this
[47:56] communication network that will work and
[47:58] will it needs to save your life, right?
[48:00] It needs to talk to your friends, needs
[48:03] to be able to get you out from a very
[48:06] dangerous situation. And so I started
[48:08] thinking about technology in that sense.
[48:11] So you need technology that will save
[48:14] your life when your life when you are
[48:16] the most scared when your life is in
[48:18] danger because that could happen to
[48:19] everyone. And and so that is basically
[48:22] how how I try to think about everything
[48:24] that I build in in in um in Tether. I
[48:28] could talk to you all day, man. I uh I'm
[48:30] obviously very impressed with uh what
[48:32] you guys are doing with Tether, but I
[48:33] think that the broader vision and kind
[48:35] of the vision for humanity and its
[48:36] intersection with technology is is
[48:38] inspiring. Um and uh you know, I'm glad
[48:41] that you guys have the capital uh
[48:43] available to you to go and see if uh if
[48:45] you can help usher that world in.
[48:46] there's not very many people who I think
[48:48] understand some of these problems but
[48:50] also have the the courage and ambition
[48:51] to go after them. So, uh from everyone
[48:53] else, thank you very much and we'll
[48:55] definitely do this again in the future.
[48:57] Thank you for for having me. Great
[48:59] talking to you.
