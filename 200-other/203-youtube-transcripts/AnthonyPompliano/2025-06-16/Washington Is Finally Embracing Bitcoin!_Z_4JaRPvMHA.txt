[00:00] The main priority what we could get over
[00:02] the next six months out of Washington,
[00:04] the number one thing we need is law.
[00:07] What we don't want for crypto is the uh
[00:11] is to get out of this period where
[00:12] crypto is a high priority for for this
[00:15] president, this administration, and
[00:17] Washington elected officials and not
[00:19] actually have clarity under law. Which
[00:22] means that regardless of the next
[00:23] election, crypto will be here to stay in
[00:26] the United in the United States.
[00:29] What's going on, guys? Today we've got
[00:31] an excellent episode with Patrick
[00:32] Mckenry. He is the former chairman of
[00:34] the House Financial Services Committee
[00:36] and he's the vice chair over at Andondo.
[00:38] In this conversation, we talk about
[00:40] Bitcoin, the ETFs, what's going on with
[00:42] the Bitcoin Treasury Companies. Then we
[00:44] get into all of the legislation around
[00:45] stable coins and market structure down
[00:47] in DC. And lastly, we talk about
[00:49] tokenization, how Patrick Mckenry sees
[00:52] the world evolving over the next decade.
[00:54] This conversation is packed with
[00:55] insights that come from one of
[00:57] Washington DC's most important players
[00:59] over the last few years when it comes to
[01:00] the intersection of politics and Bitcoin
[01:03] and cryptocurrency. Here's my latest
[01:04] conversation with Patrick Mckenry. All
[01:06] right, Patrick, I thought a great place
[01:07] to start this conversation is uh it
[01:09] feels like Bitcoin is now infiltrating
[01:11] both Wall Street and Washington DC. And
[01:14] part of that is the Bitcoiners are like
[01:15] pushing it into those two areas, but
[01:18] also it does feel like both the, you
[01:20] know, investors on Wall Street and the
[01:21] politicians in DC, they're also pulling
[01:24] uh to a degree as well. In your
[01:26] experience, what what is happening here
[01:28] at the intersection and like why is it
[01:30] now that we're seeing Bitcoin actually
[01:31] infiltrate specifically maybe Washington
[01:33] DC from your perspective? Uh it's cross
[01:37] the Rubicon. I mean, this is, you know,
[01:39] we're we're well past a decade from uh,
[01:42] you know, Satoshi's white paper. Uh,
[01:45] this is now about mass adoption and real
[01:48] momentum. The fact is that Washington
[01:50] follows uh Washington is not a
[01:53] leadership group. It's a following group
[01:54] and they're following their
[01:55] constituents. Elected officials are
[01:57] following their constituents. Their
[01:59] constituents are jazzed about uh Bitcoin
[02:01] and digital assets generally. And
[02:04] because of that, you've seen this
[02:05] bipartisan group on Capitol Hill uh
[02:08] prioritize digital assets as well as
[02:10] this administration and this president
[02:12] in particular. And when you see the
[02:15] president of the United States uh his
[02:17] cabinet, everyone seems to own Bitcoin,
[02:19] right? And one of the things that I've
[02:20] seen in finance is uh an institution
[02:23] does not start to participate or you
[02:25] know uh create a product or buy Bitcoin
[02:27] or whatever until the people who make up
[02:29] that institution own Bitcoin themselves.
[02:31] It does feel like that is now a huge
[02:33] part of what's happening on Capitol Hill
[02:35] and kind of in Washington broadly. Is
[02:37] that your experience talking to various
[02:39] colleagues that you've had over the
[02:40] years? Yeah, I mean there's the there's
[02:42] the whole idea if you're messing around
[02:45] in in a market or messing around with a
[02:47] product, uh you can then talk about it
[02:49] much more deeply. I mean that's that's a
[02:51] human nature, right? Uh and since we're
[02:54] a family program, I can't use the actual
[02:56] I I I wouldn't use the actual term for
[02:58] this, but you're going to find out,
[03:00] right? if you can if you uh uh if you
[03:02] use it. Um so that's happening and
[03:05] that's now happening. So I served in
[03:07] Congress for 20 years. The ethics rules
[03:09] prevented me from owning Bitcoin uh and
[03:12] legislating around digital assets. So I
[03:16] served in government without having the
[03:18] ability to actually be on uh you know a
[03:22] decentralized exchange or a centralized
[03:24] exchange and and buying and selling
[03:27] these products just to get some usage,
[03:28] understand how it works and all that
[03:30] stuff. So I had to do it through other
[03:31] people and having other people walk me
[03:34] through the experience of it. All the
[03:36] while I'm trying to legislate and
[03:37] actually do what my constituents want is
[03:39] to provide some clarity in the place uh
[03:42] around digital assets. Now there's been
[03:44] a lot of progress I think that has come
[03:45] out of Washington but in kind of a weird
[03:47] way right you know if you look at the
[03:48] SEC's approval of the Bitcoin ETFs
[03:51] technically that is not politicians who
[03:53] are directly overseeing that decision
[03:54] but there is an element of these
[03:56] regulatory bodies do report to the
[03:58] politicians and so talk a little bit
[03:59] about maybe you know we're 18 months or
[04:02] so post that uh decision where are the
[04:04] regulatory bodies from the position of
[04:07] Congress or or maybe some other uh kind
[04:09] of oversight over these regulatory
[04:11] bodies that seem to now be very much
[04:13] supportive of Bitcoin and crypto at
[04:15] large. Uh well, it's because of the
[04:16] election. Uh this this is this is
[04:18] fundamental to how we we prioritize
[04:21] policy in the United States. Elections
[04:22] have consequences. This president got
[04:25] elected on a pro- digital asset
[04:27] platform, very aggressively. So, uh this
[04:30] president is uh is the most pro- digital
[04:33] asset uh pro- crypto president we've
[04:36] ever seen. So, he's put made this a
[04:38] priority. And so therefore his
[04:40] appointees um have been uh aligned with
[04:44] his view. You're seeing this at the CFTC
[04:47] which regulates commodities. You're
[04:49] seeing this at Securities Exchange
[04:50] Commission which regulates securities.
[04:53] And most notably uh one of the most
[04:55] anti- crypto uh you know regulators in
[05:00] the world was Gary Gendler heading up
[05:02] the Securities Exchange Commission. So
[05:03] to go from a pro- crypto uh I'm sorry, a
[05:06] highly anti-crypto
[05:08] uh chair of the SEC who's running that
[05:11] agency to a very pro- crypto uh
[05:14] regulator of the SEC has has a dramatic
[05:16] influence on this. But it all comes from
[05:19] the election and the election uh
[05:21] prioritized digital assets and made very
[05:23] clear to the elected officials uh we
[05:25] need action both legislatively and
[05:28] regulatory. Do you think that that's
[05:30] also leading to some of these like
[05:32] Bitcoin treasury companies that have
[05:33] popped up like it does feel you get the
[05:35] election, you get the change in the
[05:36] regulatory structure? Obviously
[05:38] investors, they're capitalists, they
[05:40] want to make money, but they do maybe
[05:41] feel like the waters are a little
[05:43] warmer, like you know, you can kind of
[05:44] come in now and and they don't have to
[05:45] kind of look over their shoulder and
[05:47] that's really fueling some of these new
[05:49] trends that we're seeing in the
[05:50] industry. Yeah. It's like it's like they
[05:52] they want like virtual reality rather
[05:55] than the reality. they they instead of
[05:57] going swimming they they want pictures
[05:58] of people swimming. Um no it it it shows
[06:01] that uh Wall Street and highly regulated
[06:04] financials have wanted to be in this in
[06:06] these waters rather than look at a
[06:09] simulation but were prevented by the
[06:11] Biden administration regulators from
[06:12] engaging in this that comes from clear
[06:15] memos at these agency at the agency
[06:17] level uh clear directive out of the
[06:19] White House. Um and uh and so they are
[06:22] now getting into these waters, but they
[06:25] should have been doing this or could
[06:26] have been doing this a few years ago uh
[06:29] had they had a regulators that were
[06:31] thoughtful about it or at least modestly
[06:33] thoughtful about it unlike uh the agency
[06:36] heads that that that Biden appointed by
[06:38] by and large. Now, we've got these two
[06:41] bills that everyone's talking about and
[06:43] you know, I spent most of my time
[06:44] talking about uh the industry at large
[06:46] and frankly um when I first went to
[06:49] Washington DC, I went for two days. I
[06:51] think it was in 2018 or 2019. I got
[06:54] invited down by some staffers. Uh and I
[06:56] went and I met with a bunch of the
[06:57] different congressman's office and and
[06:58] really was with the staffers more so
[07:00] than the the elected officials
[07:01] themselves. And I walked out of there
[07:02] and I said, "We got a long way to go."
[07:04] That was my big takeaway. Uh fast
[07:07] forward to today. Now, these bills are
[07:09] some of the most important things that
[07:11] are actually being talked about in
[07:12] Washington DC. So, we got the stablecoin
[07:13] bill, we got the market structure bill.
[07:15] Um, the first question is like, why are
[07:17] they different bills? I think that
[07:18] you've got some unique thoughts here,
[07:19] but like like two different bills for
[07:21] something that seems to come from the
[07:22] same industry almost seems like it's uh,
[07:24] you know, uh, just doing it twice, you
[07:26] know, banging your head against the wall
[07:27] instead of just doing it once. So uh I
[07:30] was the chair of the financial services
[07:31] committee the last Congress and I was a
[07:33] ranking member lead Republican lead
[07:36] minority uh leader on uh the financial
[07:38] services committee for four years before
[07:40] that. Uh so I under then chairman Maxine
[07:44] Waters started the conversation around
[07:46] crypto and legislating on crypto and uh
[07:50] then chair of the committee Maxine
[07:52] Waters was much more interested in
[07:54] legislating around stable coins and her
[07:56] team was as well. So I thought, well,
[07:59] we'll engage in that. We can we can take
[08:01] a baby step here uh to to legislating
[08:04] around digital assets and we'll just do
[08:07] stable coins. This is a pretty easy
[08:09] thing to actually legislate around. We
[08:11] have an existing uh regulatory process
[08:15] at the state level that we could crib
[08:17] from and New York being the the the big
[08:20] regulator of stable coins in the United
[08:21] States. So we'll take their experience,
[08:23] we'll apply it to the federal level.
[08:25] We'll take some additional federal laws,
[08:26] we'll apply it to these payment rails uh
[08:29] for for a stable coin. It's pretty
[08:31] simple product. Okay? And so we cut and
[08:34] pasteed from existing law by and large
[08:36] at the federal level and built a stable
[08:38] coin regime uh and and try to legislate
[08:41] around that. That's one initiative. The
[08:44] other initiative was a market structure
[08:46] bill. We had the fight between the CFTC
[08:48] which regulates commodities like Bitcoin
[08:50] or uh the futures market right uh
[08:54] commodities futures market uh and uh and
[08:58] crop futures things of that sort. So
[09:01] Bitcoin is clearly a commodity not a
[09:03] security uh but we had a food fight
[09:05] between the CFTC and the SEC. We also
[09:08] had to define what was a digital asset
[09:10] which has never been done before in
[09:11] federal law. We're going to do a lot of
[09:13] other things that are not simply cut and
[09:15] pasting existing law. So, uh, I made
[09:18] that my main priority as chair of the
[09:20] the committee. That's what that's how we
[09:22] passed FIT 21 last Congress, which got a
[09:25] twothirds vote in the House of
[09:26] Representatives, bipartisan vote. But we
[09:28] separated the two thinking we could get
[09:30] some broader support around a simple
[09:33] undertaking on stable coins and then it
[09:35] would take longer on a more complex
[09:37] market structure bill. That was it. It
[09:39] was simply a political decision to take
[09:43] uh separate these policies. That was it.
[09:45] Now this Congress is has assumed uh what
[09:49] what we did last Congress and what we
[09:52] spent the last 5 years working on. Uh I
[09:54] think it's a mistake. I think we can do
[09:56] one crypto bill, have the president sign
[09:59] into law which would provide the on-ramp
[10:01] stable coins uh to the crypto
[10:03] marketplace and also provide clarity of
[10:06] law. So we can't have a Gendza regime.
[10:08] We can't have a rogue regulator kill the
[10:10] digital asset ecosystem. And I think we
[10:13] can do that in one bill. I don't think
[10:14] it has to be two separate bills uh like
[10:16] the current legislative undertaking has.
[10:19] And when you see these bills coming out,
[10:22] like what are the big push backs? Like
[10:24] is there anything that the critics uh
[10:26] actually are bringing up or using as a
[10:29] critique that you're like, you know
[10:29] what, that makes sense. I understand
[10:30] where they're coming from. Maybe I think
[10:32] they should overlook that and you know,
[10:33] go ahead and support this. But it does
[10:35] feel like we're reaching a point now
[10:37] where I don't know anyone who's against
[10:39] stable coins with any sort of legit
[10:42] critique where you're like, you know
[10:43] what, that makes sense to me, but maybe
[10:44] there's politicians who, you know,
[10:46] actually do have concerns that we should
[10:47] be paying attention to. Today's episode

[12:49] does feel like we're reaching a point
[12:50] now where I don't know anyone who's
[12:53] against stable coins with any sort of
[12:55] legit critique where you're like, you
[12:57] know what, that makes sense to me. But
[12:58] maybe there's politicians who, you know,
[13:00] actually do have concerns that we should
[13:01] be paying attention to. So there are a
[13:03] couple concerns but if you look at the
[13:05] markup if you look at the uh the
[13:07] committee uh working on legislation for
[13:09] market structure in the house the whole
[13:12] debate was about Donald Trump and this
[13:14] was about the Trump family and it was
[13:16] about nothing to do with the actual
[13:20] contents of the legislative legislation
[13:22] before them but about thing things that
[13:24] were second uh other issues secondary to
[13:28] uh rule of law around crypto. And so it
[13:32] was the fact that the bill doesn't deal
[13:34] with congressional ethics. I'm sorry. Uh
[13:36] Senate uh the Senate or House ethics
[13:39] don't apply to the president or the
[13:41] executive branch because they don't. Uh
[13:43] but that's not what the financial
[13:45] services committee or the banking
[13:46] committee does or what a crypto bill
[13:48] does. Um we already have financial
[13:51] disclosure uh requirements on elected
[13:53] officials. So it became a frucus about
[13:55] that, not actually about the contents of
[13:58] the bill. Uh but the uh deeper
[14:01] conversation that a number of my
[14:03] Democratic colleagues and some of my
[14:05] Republican colleagues have is around
[14:07] illicit finance and the idea that you're
[14:09] going to use digital assets uh for money
[14:11] laundering um and to to fund uh drugs,
[14:16] war, uh bad regimes like North Korea and
[14:19] Russia. Uh and there is there's a a
[14:23] question you have to that is a serious
[14:24] question you have to answer in this
[14:26] legislation. The way to answer that is
[14:29] to explain to them the actual workings
[14:33] of a blockchain. The dumbest place to
[14:36] launder value is on an open
[14:40] permissionless blockchain. The idea that
[14:43] uh the idea that you and I would
[14:45] exchange some value, we're better off in
[14:47] a parking lot doing that with cash. And
[14:49] that is how it's done globally is
[14:51] through American dollars in suitcases of
[14:55] cash or bundles of cash. So they're
[14:57] saying, well, that's what happens on a
[14:59] blockchain. That is absolutely absurd.
[15:02] If they understood what an open
[15:04] permissionless blockchain uh requires,
[15:06] it would show not only that you and I
[15:09] had an exchange, but it would show you
[15:12] and I exchanged this value in this
[15:15] second, not even the minute, but the
[15:17] second it would happen. Um, and so the
[15:20] FBI, the CIA, they think blockchains are
[15:23] fabulous uh for for actually following
[15:26] the bad guys and stopping bad guys. Um,
[15:30] so, you know, we got to answer this
[15:31] question, but it's also a failure to
[15:33] understand the technology. Uh, those are
[15:35] the two big debates and not a question
[15:38] of the of the trade-offs that these
[15:40] these bills are making between two
[15:42] agencies or the regulatory format around
[15:44] these two agencies powers. Now, as we
[15:48] kind of see those critiques, I think get
[15:50] answered, the question then becomes,
[15:52] okay, we're going to get the stable coin
[15:53] bill uh approved, we're going to get the
[15:55] uh market structure bill approved. Let's
[15:57] say we have some sort of foundation now
[15:59] where America says, hey, we are actually
[16:01] in on uh on Bitcoin and
[16:02] cryptocurrencies, we want to be a leader
[16:04] here. Um what's next? And I think that
[16:07] there's two areas that people are really
[16:08] interested in. One is the intersection
[16:10] of cryptocurrency and artificial
[16:12] intelligence. And it feels like it's
[16:13] kind of a part of this whole, you know,
[16:15] automation world. Obviously, stable
[16:16] coins play a big part there, but the
[16:18] part that I know that you've been
[16:19] spending a lot of time on is
[16:20] tokenization. And you hear everyone from
[16:22] Larry Frink to, you know, the crazy uh
[16:24] crypto person on Twitter. Everyone is
[16:26] talking about the fact that they want to
[16:27] do tokenization. Uh you're you are the
[16:29] vice chair uh I think of the advisory uh
[16:33] council at Ando uh which is a big part
[16:35] of this. But before we talk about
[16:36] Andondo, let's talk about tokenization
[16:38] in general and where you see this kind
[16:40] of playing into it uh in terms of we get
[16:43] the foundation from a regulatory
[16:44] standpoint and from a a kind of
[16:46] political structure standpoint. Okay.
[16:48] How does this play out in your eyes over
[16:50] the next you know decade or so? Well, so
[16:52] let's so tokenization that that the idea
[16:55] that we're going to take real world
[16:56] assets and put them on chain has been
[16:58] discussed at a high level. uh but the
[17:01] way you do that is is a very important
[17:04] uh very important conversation. Well,
[17:07] let's talk about the the most readily
[17:09] available assets and how you could
[17:11] easily put them on a new technology and
[17:13] trade them there. So, the treasuries
[17:15] market is the largest market in the
[17:17] world uh as well as the broader
[17:20] securities marketplace uh stock
[17:22] ownership. Um those are the first two
[17:26] avenues to put onchain and to have
[17:30] global 24/7 365 trading of these assets.
[17:35] Um and there are a number of companies
[17:37] that are doing this a number of large
[17:39] existing uh tradi uh organizations and a
[17:43] lot of new technologists that are doing
[17:45] as well. Um and so I think this is the
[17:48] bleeding edge of crypto adoption. I
[17:51] think this is this requires not a
[17:53] mindset shift for Wall Street and Wall
[17:55] Street traders or the global demand for
[17:57] the US dollar. Um but playing on that
[18:01] this is uh faster, better, cheaper way
[18:06] to trade and so the adoption here is a
[18:09] software update not a mindset shift for
[18:11] these markets. So companies like Ando
[18:14] are bringing uh the treasuries market um
[18:17] onchain and giving uh global
[18:19] availability availability to non- US
[18:22] citizens um to to uh the treasuries
[18:26] market for the first time in a in a
[18:28] regulated smart way. And so uh I think
[18:31] this is a a you know a type of company
[18:33] to a type of organization to look at uh
[18:36] because this is uh this is about the
[18:38] first wave of crypto adoption among
[18:41] traditional players in finance as this
[18:44] plays out. Uh where are the areas where
[18:46] you think politicians can be helpful to
[18:48] the industry? Right? You know I think a
[18:50] lot of times we look at and say hey the
[18:51] technologist they got to go build this
[18:52] stuff the financeers they got to fund
[18:54] it. But it does feel like when you are
[18:56] playing in regulated markets, especially
[18:58] things that have this idea of kind of
[18:59] furthering, you know, America's economic
[19:01] independence and and kind of
[19:03] superiority, politicians do play a big
[19:05] part here. They do. And I think the the
[19:08] main priority what we could get over the
[19:10] next 6 months out of Washington, the
[19:12] number one thing we need is law. What we
[19:16] don't want for crypto is the uh is to
[19:19] get out of this period where crypto is a
[19:21] high priority for for this president,
[19:23] this administration and Washington
[19:25] elected officials and not actually have
[19:27] clarity under law which means that
[19:30] regardless of the next election crypto
[19:32] will be here to stay in the United in
[19:35] the United States. It obviously didn't
[19:37] go away even though we had a bad
[19:39] administration was anti-crypto. uh the
[19:41] adoption just happened overseas in the
[19:43] United States and United States citizens
[19:46] uh were left behind because of that. We
[19:48] need to be at the leading edge of
[19:50] technology and to get clarity of law is
[19:52] how we do this. When you talked about uh
[19:55] uh the merger of AI and crypto I think
[19:58] with AI identity is such a huge problem
[20:02] huge challenge that that we're wrestling
[20:04] with as a society. crypto is the answer
[20:07] uh for proof of proof of human. It's uh
[20:11] it's actually proof of identity that can
[20:13] merge very nicely with with the
[20:15] challenges of identity in an AI world.
[20:19] So we need to make sure that there's
[20:20] clarity of law in the in the short run.
[20:22] In the long run, we're going to have
[20:23] regulatory clarity from these these
[20:25] appointed uh officials that you you
[20:27] mentioned uh that President Trump
[20:30] appointed the to run these agencies.
[20:32] that's going to more deeply embed these
[20:34] products across existing players and uh
[20:38] the leaders that have been uh driving
[20:41] digital adoption uh of crypto. How does
[20:44] decentralization start to change some of
[20:47] the lawmakers uh kind of participation,
[20:50] right? One of the things I always uh
[20:51] used to think about and talk to folks is
[20:54] jaywalking in New York City is
[20:55] technically illegal. Everyone does it
[20:57] because there's no enforcement, right?
[20:58] Um, if you think about some of these
[21:01] rules, it is very clear that maybe a
[21:04] centralized exchange needs to file
[21:05] certain paperwork and there is
[21:08] punishment or consequences if they don't
[21:10] do that. When you all of a sudden have a
[21:11] decentralized exchange, there's no
[21:14] paperwork that can be filed. But also,
[21:16] who do you punish? Do you go to the
[21:18] developer? Do you go to the technology?
[21:20] And these are, you know, kind of big
[21:21] grand questions that I think everyone is
[21:23] struggling with and we may not have good
[21:24] answers yet, but specifically around
[21:27] real world assets and tokenization, that
[21:29] is to me the biggest intersection
[21:31] between crypto and like the regulated
[21:32] financial world. And so, how has
[21:34] politicians or lawmakers thought through
[21:36] some of these aspects of like
[21:38] decentralization and changing, you know,
[21:40] maybe the way that you actually create
[21:41] laws or that the way that the laws can
[21:43] actually be enforced uh because of that
[21:45] decentralization?
[21:47] Uh well that question is like asking uh
[21:51] you know whether or not you're going to
[21:52] have cars pick you up via the internet
[21:55] in 1995. It would be like talking about
[21:58] the financial structures of the 1980s
[22:01] when we were passing the Securities
[22:03] Exchange Act, the Securities Act and the
[22:05] Securities Exchange Act in 1933 and 34.
[22:08] Um so this is really uh over the horizon
[22:11] thinking. It's great questions. Um, but
[22:15] lawmakers are are wrestling with the
[22:16] here and now, not not these these these
[22:19] sort of the future environment, much
[22:21] less like going back to 1996, the
[22:24] Telecom Act of 1996 revol revolutionized
[22:28] the internet, but no one predicted uh
[22:31] mass adoption of the consumer internet
[22:33] like we've experienced in our in our
[22:35] lifetime. So I I think I think we're I
[22:39] I'm much more optimistic about the
[22:42] benefits of decentralization
[22:45] uh than any of the negative consequences
[22:48] to society. You we can wrestle we can
[22:50] have like serious debates about AI and
[22:52] the consequences on society. But
[22:54] decentralization
[22:56] will bring down the cost of exchanging
[22:59] uh value uh and uh and aligning that
[23:03] with words, speech um in a way that I
[23:07] don't think we can fully fully
[23:09] understand. Um and I think crypto will
[23:11] be deeply embedded into the internet,
[23:13] will be deeply embedded in into finance,
[23:16] not 15 years in the future, 20 years in
[23:18] the future, but within 5 years in ways
[23:21] that we can't even contemplate today. It
[23:24] it is pretty surprising at how fast this
[23:26] moves and you know Bitcoin it's only 15
[23:28] years old. Um and we talked earlier
[23:31] about how long you all have been working
[23:33] on some of these bills, right? And so as
[23:35] you're trying to work through the rules,
[23:37] uh the technology is just rapidly
[23:39] appreciating and kind of value to to
[23:41] people. Um how do the lawmakers look at
[23:44] uh who the players are? That that's
[23:46] always been fascinating to me, right? 15
[23:48] years ago it was a bunch of crazy people
[23:49] on the internet. Then it was kind of
[23:50] like okay maybe a little bit more
[23:52] mainstream but still it was the internet
[23:53] and kind of individuals. Now you have
[23:55] the biggest financial institutions in
[23:57] the world. You have other governments
[23:58] that are participating in this industry
[24:00] whether it's you know Bitcoin some sort
[24:01] of altcoin thing or even tokenization.
[24:04] And so does that change any of the
[24:06] lawmaking process? Today's episode is
[24:09] sponsored by Figure the largest non-bank
[24:11] home equity lender in the United States
[24:13] with over $15 billion unlocked on their
[24:16] lending platform. They are now in the
[24:18] cryptobacked loan space and they offer
[24:20] industry low interest rates when you use
[24:22] your Bitcoin as collateral to get cash.
[24:24] You can access interest rates starting
[24:26] at 9.9% the lowest fixed rate in the
[24:29] industry at 50% LTVs. Whether you're
[24:32] funding a major purchase like a down
[24:33] payment on a home, investing in new
[24:35] opportunities, or even buying more
[24:37] Bitcoin, Figure makes it straightforward
[24:39] and transparent. You can go to
[24:41] figure.com/pmp
[24:42] or click on my link below to take a
[24:44] Bitcoin back loan with Figure today. I'm
[24:46] an investor in the company and I have
[24:48] spent a lot of time trying to understand
[24:50] this product. So, go visit figure.com/p
[24:53] to better understand exactly what
[24:54] they're doing and how these rates work.
[24:57] You can go to figure.com/p
[24:59] today. It does you got to build
[25:02] credibility. Uh this is a big challenge
[25:04] for techn technologists generally on
[25:07] coming to DC. uh you got to do the reps
[25:10] to build credibility. You got to do the
[25:11] reps. In order to have uh a meaningful
[25:14] relationship and trust uh with
[25:16] lawmakers, you have to have um you have
[25:20] to have connectivity with them. Um and
[25:23] uh and so crypto has had a forceful
[25:26] engagement really over the last three
[25:29] years. Um but uh but have have been at
[25:32] it for a couple congresses before that.
[25:35] that is that credibility uh has been
[25:37] built up in the system because of the
[25:39] reps showing up engaging educating a lot
[25:44] of education has had to take place and
[25:46] then finally the industry said well this
[25:50] is an existential crisis. You basically
[25:52] have a regime in Washington that wanted
[25:54] to put uh crypto the the leading folks
[25:57] in crypto, the leading centralized
[25:59] exchanges, they want to put them
[26:01] effectively in jail, right? And they
[26:04] said, "Okay, our backs against the wall.
[26:06] We're going to go all in and we're going
[26:08] to go all in because the elections, this
[26:10] election will determine whether or not
[26:11] we can do crypto in the United States."
[26:14] Thankfully, uh, Crypto won and Crypto
[26:16] won, uh, with, um, probably almost all
[26:20] Republicans and probably 30% of
[26:24] Democrats at this point, 30 35% of
[26:27] Democrats are pro crypto, uh, in votes
[26:30] and proof. And so, uh, that tells me
[26:32] that the electorate, uh, is aligned with
[26:36] the industry and wants adoption and
[26:38] wants people to be but wants their
[26:40] leaders to be pro crypto. Um, that's
[26:43] really where the fire is, right, with
[26:45] the with the populist to um to to engage
[26:48] here and to make sure they hold their
[26:50] elected officials accountable. What
[26:52] other advice do you have for some of
[26:54] these founders, technologists or
[26:56] builders? Uh, I think, you know, you and
[26:58] I both have seen the pilgrimages that
[27:00] people are making to Washington. Feels
[27:01] like kind of Washington is now uh, you
[27:03] know, wants to talk about this, wants to
[27:05] meet these people, open for business.
[27:08] Yeah. What do you think are the dos and
[27:09] don'ts? like are there like hey I've
[27:12] seen it a million times here's the
[27:13] mistakes that people make whether things
[27:15] they say the way they dress the way they
[27:16] act the the maybe the perspective they
[27:18] bring and then also like what are the
[27:20] things they should be doing that can you
[27:22] know you mentioned reps but are there
[27:23] other things that really kind of build
[27:24] credibility
[27:26] um no I like the the reps matter but
[27:29] what you want to do is come in and be
[27:32] the best version of yourself you could
[27:33] possibly be that's that's really it but
[27:35] you don't want to be something fake
[27:37] don't do that don't do that I mean no
[27:39] one likes fakers especially even in
[27:42] Washington
[27:43] which which you know there are a lot of
[27:45] pretenders here um but uh they they want
[27:48] they want a sincere uh interaction they
[27:52] want to see what we need to do now and
[27:54] they want to see the future and I think
[27:57] there's a huge opportunity with folks in
[27:59] crypto to explain what the future looks
[28:03] like if we can unlock some some key
[28:06] things in Washington that is a really
[28:08] cool conversation when you when you take
[28:10] people on that walk and if you can come
[28:13] in and be a value ad to their thinking,
[28:15] you build credibility, show yourself to
[28:17] be smart, um that that matters. And um
[28:21] and I think focusing on that is rather
[28:25] than the the you know than showing up
[28:27] and pretending to be something you're
[28:29] not, I think being being yourself and
[28:31] being the best version of yourself and
[28:32] being an educator is key. There's a uh a
[28:36] gentleman that I'm friends with who's
[28:38] basically a modern philosopher uh also
[28:40] known as the driver for many of the
[28:42] athletes in New York City. And he
[28:43] recently said uh you can go broke and
[28:45] get money again, but if you go fake, you
[28:48] can never be real again. And I think
[28:50] that's pretty that's pretty fair, right?
[28:52] That is spot on. That is spot on. And
[28:54] that's what happens like you see this
[28:56] with elected officials, right? And then
[28:59] you you prove them out to be a fake and
[29:01] they can never come back. They've
[29:03] destroyed themselves. I mean, this is,
[29:05] you know, you talk about this, but like
[29:06] the memes actually are a huge driver of
[29:10] public perception. Um, and if you look
[29:13] right now, the the spat between um,
[29:16] President Trump and Elon Musk has
[29:18] captivated like the best stuff that I've
[29:21] seen sent to me on X and Instagram and
[29:24] all this stuff is AI generated film
[29:27] about the breakup and the the emotional
[29:29] nature of it. I mean, it it really shows
[29:32] you how those two individuals have
[29:33] captivated the populace and they're both
[29:36] very real, quite authentic, um, and, uh,
[29:41] larger than life. So, it, you know,
[29:43] these memes really do drive perception,
[29:46] and fakers get uh, get sused out pretty
[29:49] pretty strongly these days. I love it.
[29:51] Let's talk about Onondo. Uh, they are
[29:53] really pushing, I think, the edge of
[29:55] innovation when it comes to this
[29:56] tokenization. Uh, they want to build
[29:57] kind of a Wall Street 2.0. uh you're an
[30:00] adviser to them. What are you interested
[30:02] in there or kind of how do you think
[30:03] about their place in this ecosystem? So
[30:05] when I left government, I wanted to
[30:07] affiliate with high quality people doing
[30:09] really good work and I wanted to be
[30:11] measured about my engagement with crypto
[30:13] and I wanted to be engaged with people
[30:15] that were on the leading edge of where I
[30:18] thought the first wave of adoption would
[30:20] be. Um and that's the crew. Um what
[30:24] they're what they're doing is putting on
[30:25] chain uh first the treasuries market. uh
[30:28] but they're going to keep adding uh uh
[30:30] adding uh uh securities and uh other
[30:34] real world assets on chain and to give
[30:37] uh adoption to giving access to the
[30:40] world uh to US regulated markets is a is
[30:44] quite an undertaking uh but something
[30:46] very interested uh folks very interested
[30:49] in embracing and so that's where we've
[30:51] seen adoption where we've seen uh folks
[30:55] uh you know really
[30:58] interested in every move that has been
[31:00] made by this team at Ono. So, great to
[31:02] be bolted onto this team and really
[31:04] excited about what they're doing. Well,
[31:05] what's interesting to me maybe about
[31:06] kind of their philosophy or their
[31:08] approach is I've seen a lot of these uh
[31:10] you kind tokenization platforms and many
[31:12] of them are focused on the asset
[31:13] themselves and there's some version of
[31:15] I'm going take a stock, a treasury or
[31:17] whatever, put a wrapper around it and
[31:19] then I can just go put it onto these
[31:20] blockchains. But to me, it feels like is
[31:23] much more focused on the infrastructure
[31:24] itself. uh they want to kind of rebuild
[31:27] the pipes of which then these assets
[31:29] will sit on and it's kind of a like a
[31:31] vertically integrated type solution. Um
[31:33] how have you thought about you know do
[31:35] you have to rehaul all of the
[31:37] traditional financial system in order
[31:38] for this to work or do you think that
[31:40] there is some kind of middle ground
[31:41] where maybe there's some evolution of
[31:43] existing technologies plus uh these
[31:45] tokenized assets. So I think what what
[31:47] you see with Ando is they take a current
[31:49] uh current regulatory approach right
[31:52] currently available uh rules rules of
[31:54] the road uh and they're taking a a
[31:57] cryptonative infrastructure building out
[32:00] the cryptonative infrastructure and and
[32:03] merging those two uh but without being
[32:05] cryptonative it's very hard all you're
[32:08] doing is really uh adding a new expense
[32:11] to what is like Washington is do like
[32:13] but New York is doing pretty well right
[32:16] the world fin wall street is doing
[32:17] pretty well. So you've got to go soup to
[32:20] nuts with a with crypto plumbing and
[32:22] pipes in order to build this this
[32:24] infrastructure out in order to get a
[32:27] real cost advantage and uh to to
[32:30] actually have a global markets on this
[32:32] platform. So that that's what makes it
[32:34] exciting that that the actual plumbing
[32:36] and the pipes that's a lot of the boring
[32:38] stuff of of finance but really important
[32:41] to uh the user experience and the cost
[32:44] structure around it and getting that
[32:46] right is what the crew is doing. Yeah.
[32:49] You know what's funny is I was talking
[32:50] to the team over there uh recently and
[32:52] we were joking about this whole like 247
[32:54] trading and uh it's like a layup tweet.
[32:56] Anytime you want to, you know, get a
[32:58] little engagement just say like hey
[32:59] stock market's closed, Bitcoin's open,
[33:00] right? And uh there's like an an entire
[33:03] generation of people who are like that's
[33:04] crazy. Um and when you do unpack it
[33:07] though, you know, maybe there's a little
[33:08] bit of regulatory reasoning for it, but
[33:10] really it is uh people just want to
[33:12] sleep, right? They want to shut, you
[33:14] know, kind of hours of operations. So
[33:16] you're dealing with like legacy, you
[33:17] know, kind of uh thought process. The
[33:20] systems can I think we're seeing
[33:21] companies like Robin Hood and others
[33:23] kind of extend those hours in unique
[33:25] ways. Um but I don't know anyone who
[33:28] isn't like, hey, obviously the markets
[33:29] are going to be 24/7 at some point in
[33:31] the future. And so is crypto kind of
[33:34] like the Trojan horse? Like do we need
[33:35] these new technologies to come in and
[33:37] and kind of like assault Wall Street and
[33:39] say look we're actually going to compete
[33:40] and by competing that's going to lead to
[33:42] the innovation. And the innovation leads
[33:43] to the better experience for the user,
[33:45] right? That's that's that's basically
[33:46] what it is. You you have to have
[33:47] innovators innovate and drag the rest of
[33:50] the industry into it once there's
[33:52] adoption. And once there's adoption, all
[33:54] these existing players are going to
[33:55] start trying to to fill in. So it's
[33:58] really about this first mover advantage
[34:00] you have to have and getting uh deep
[34:02] substantive engagement and adoption. And
[34:05] that's going to that's going to that's
[34:07] going to go change the whole world and
[34:09] how how we uh interact with with the
[34:11] world of finance. Now you're in a pretty
[34:14] unique spot, right? I think that you sit
[34:16] uh kind of at the intersection of three
[34:18] different things. You actually have the
[34:19] experience from Washington DC and your
[34:21] time as congressman uh the house
[34:23] financial services committee. Uh you are
[34:25] an adviser to what I'll consider uh the
[34:27] stripes and the A16Zs and the onos and
[34:30] like the the kind of technology and
[34:32] crypto can kind of fit in there. But
[34:34] then also you are an adviser to Lazard
[34:36] and kind of traditional finance and so
[34:38] you know you more so than most people I
[34:40] think that I could talk with have an
[34:41] insight into how these three groups
[34:43] groups are all talking about it. How
[34:45] much do they agree on? Cuz it does feel
[34:47] like we are now getting consensus to it.
[34:49] You know it was all contrarian before
[34:51] but now it does feel like the
[34:53] conversations maybe you're having on a
[34:54] day-to-day basis with groups from three
[34:55] different industries maybe there's a lot
[34:57] more overlap than we would have thought
[34:59] there would have been you know maybe 5
[35:00] years ago. Well, they all agree now that
[35:03] it's here to stay, and that was
[35:04] certainly not the case two years ago. Uh
[35:07] certainly not the case 5 years ago. Um
[35:09] but crypto is here to stay. It's it's uh
[35:12] it is not it is not the bleeding edge of
[35:15] technology. It is technology adopted
[35:18] today. Uh every uh every business is
[35:22] looking at AI. Every business is looking
[35:24] at crypto and wants to understand how it
[35:26] affects them. uh every small bank to a
[35:29] large bank is looking at at at both
[35:32] those pieces of technology and and how
[35:33] it affects their their platform and
[35:35] their profitability. Um it is affecting
[35:38] every industry in America. Um and those
[35:41] that are thinking about it deeply and in
[35:44] applying best principles uh to the to
[35:47] crypto adoption and AI adoption, those
[35:50] are going to be the the standout uh
[35:52] stock performance. It's going to that's
[35:54] going to be the standout performance for
[35:55] the for the coming years. And those that
[35:58] think it doesn't affect them, well,
[35:59] they're going to find out it affects
[36:01] every industry across uh across the the
[36:04] world. Uh and and if you want to be if
[36:07] you want to, you know, you're either uh
[36:10] behind uh and dead or you can or you're
[36:13] ahead and you're going to be profitable
[36:15] and uh and and and you know, have a a
[36:18] great decade ahead. Maybe where we can
[36:21] wrap up is uh this is all really
[36:23] exciting and I think that people know
[36:26] there is more to go when you look at
[36:29] Bitcoin and kind of the broader
[36:30] cryptocurrency industry. What is your
[36:32] expectation for what happens over the
[36:34] next, you know, five or 10 years and and
[36:36] kind of what what are the things that
[36:37] you're most excited about? Well, what
[36:39] I'm excited about is is bringing down
[36:42] the cost of payments. The idea that
[36:43] we're going to uh link bits and bites on
[36:45] the internet with some form of digitally
[36:49] native payments uh will change the
[36:52] economics of digital connectivity
[36:54] globally. Um and I think that's the most
[36:57] exciting thing unlocking
[37:00] these um really high cost of payments
[37:02] that we we experience uh to move money
[37:05] to have uh financial interactions. I
[37:07] think you're going to have this a
[37:08] massive set of new economic
[37:09] opportunities open up for individuals
[37:12] and uh businesses of all sizes. You you
[37:15] match that with AI and Aentic AI, the
[37:18] world of commerce changes completely.
[37:20] And uh it's going to be it's going to be
[37:22] really exciting to see what this looks
[37:24] like in the decade ahead. This is this
[37:27] is uh not like the first generation of
[37:30] the internet. It is even it's gonna be
[37:33] even wilder than that the first
[37:35] generation of internet technology. I
[37:37] love it. That is music to many many
[37:39] people's ears and I tend to agree with
[37:40] you. So it's going to be a fun decade to
[37:42] kind of watch this all play out.
[37:44] Patrick, thank you so much for the time
[37:45] today and we'll definitely do this again
[37:46] in the future. Look forward to it.
[37:47] Thanks for having me.
