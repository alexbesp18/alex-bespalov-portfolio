[00:00] debt to GDP is rising because of the
[00:02] distribution of wealth gap. So I wrote
[00:05] about this and this is a big step on my
[00:07] journey from a top- down basis of
[00:08] understanding what why Bitcoin's been
[00:10] growing but more importantly why debt to
[00:12] GDP has been growing. Bitcoin came out
[00:15] before debt to GDP really started to
[00:17] accelerate exponentially. It's been
[00:18] lined up with technology. The more you
[00:21] disrupt workers, the more the government
[00:24] has to subsidize and has to come in with
[00:26] more money to help those people. And it
[00:29] comes at a time when we're already going
[00:30] to see debt to GDP getting higher just
[00:33] because of the health of the country. Do
[00:34] I think 5 years from now that AI will
[00:36] start to impact that? Yes. But I think
[00:38] the next 5 years is a little bit more of
[00:41] a dystopia. It's a it's a painful point.
[00:45] What's going on guys? Today we've got a
[00:47] great episode with Jordy Visser. Jordi
[00:48] is a 30-year veteran of Wall Street and
[00:50] we talk about all of the things that
[00:52] happened this week. We get into why the
[00:53] Fed didn't cut interest rates, how to
[00:55] think about inflation, what's going on
[00:56] with Israel and Iran, how to think about
[00:58] Bitcoin in a brand new presentation that
[01:00] just came out from a big time Wall
[01:02] Street investor, and why they think
[01:03] Bitcoin is going to be bigger, but we
[01:05] disagree. We think it might be bigger
[01:07] than they think. And on top of that, we
[01:08] also get into artificial intelligence,
[01:10] what's going on with Perplexity, and
[01:12] much, much more. Here's my latest
[01:13] conversation with Jordie Visser. All
[01:15] right, Jordy, we got a lot to talk about
[01:16] today. I thought the first place we
[01:17] could start is CO2 recently had their
[01:20] annual event. They put out this great
[01:21] presentation. It's one of the highest
[01:23] quality things that I see every single
[01:24] year and they specifically talk about
[01:26] Bitcoin in here and I think you've got
[01:27] some different thoughts maybe than they
[01:29] have in terms of what Bitcoin is worth
[01:30] and how they're thinking about it. Give
[01:32] us an overview of how is CO2 thinking
[01:34] about Bitcoin and then what are the
[01:35] areas where you agree or disagree with
[01:37] them. Yeah, first of all the the report
[01:41] was great. I mean it's so Mary Mer put
[01:43] out a a very long form report two weeks
[01:46] ago, three weeks ago. Uh I didn't find
[01:48] that nearly as interesting. It was just
[01:50] a bunch of data. Some of it was old. The
[01:52] COTU stuff got into a real kind of
[01:55] futuristic look of what the market and
[01:59] public companies will look like and it
[02:01] focused on the disruption from AI, the
[02:04] benefits that will come from AI from the
[02:06] macro perspective, especially debt to
[02:08] GDP, which we can go in. But the most
[02:10] interesting thing right off the bat was
[02:12] the Bitcoin part. um it to find CO2 I
[02:17] don't want to say embracing Bitcoin but
[02:18] if you listen to the BG2 podcast the
[02:21] brothers were interviewed on there and
[02:23] Philipe spent a lot of time uh at the
[02:26] very beginning of the podcast talking
[02:27] about Bitcoin. Now in there they kind of
[02:30] list what they think the market caps
[02:32] will be due to AI and just kind of their
[02:35] views of the future by 2030.
[02:38] and they had Bitcoin I believe as the
[02:40] third biggest company with Microsoft
[02:43] number one and I think Nvidia number
[02:44] two. Now the interesting part was the
[02:48] Kager that's implied by the Bitcoin
[02:52] market cap which they added about 5
[02:53] trillion is is less than 20% over the
[02:56] next 5 years. Now, they didn't highlight
[03:00] how much of a deceleration this is
[03:02] considering the 3-year uh Bitcoin Kager
[03:05] right now is about 75%.
[03:08] The 5year is about 65% and the 10ear is
[03:11] about 85. So, somewhere within there
[03:12] you're doing 65 to to 85 on 35 and 10
[03:16] year. I've talked on here and I believe
[03:19] that the difference between what they
[03:21] have is the explosive numbers they talk
[03:25] about in AI and for those who have
[03:27] watched us now for the last 5 months,
[03:30] four months, 3 months, whatever it's
[03:32] been. Um, we've covered a lot of the
[03:34] pieces in there that they brought up. We
[03:36] covered the Sacha Nadella talking about
[03:37] a 100red trillion tokens. He they bring
[03:39] that up. We've talked about power. They
[03:41] talk about the energy side being
[03:43] basically the same. What's the
[03:45] difference between a semiconductor and a
[03:47] nuclear uh part of AI? These are both
[03:50] necessary before you actually get to the
[03:51] AI. The difference is and where my views
[03:55] are very different from where they go is
[03:57] on the belief of what AI is going to do.
[03:59] They don't talk about tokenization. They
[04:02] don't talk about the growth of the
[04:04] private market side. And most
[04:06] importantly, everything that they talk
[04:09] about with AI ends up being a revenue
[04:12] per employee thing, which is obviously a
[04:14] reduction of the labor share of profits
[04:17] for big companies. And this is where I
[04:20] think the end result is the inequality
[04:24] and the distribution of wealth. And more
[04:26] importantly, the worker revolt is one of
[04:29] the things that they didn't really get
[04:30] into this in too much detail. So, I
[04:32] happen to agree with the fact that
[04:34] Bitcoin will continue to ascend. I think
[04:36] it'll be the biggest of what they had on
[04:38] the list there and only behind gold by
[04:40] the end of this year. But in their
[04:42] world, they're really talking about a
[04:44] major disruption. One other thing that's
[04:46] interesting is they don't have Apple in
[04:47] the top 40 companies, which is a really
[04:49] interesting thing 5 years from now.
[04:51] Well, I think when they're looking out
[04:53] at this, it's really hard to imagine
[04:55] that Bitcoin can keep the compound
[04:57] growth rate that it has had. Right. You
[04:59] mentioned 65 to 85%. But one aspect that
[05:02] uh maybe is in reverse. Usually it is
[05:03] the big organizations that are adopting
[05:05] an asset and then you get the smaller
[05:06] folks coming in later. We are seeing
[05:08] this like acceleration because now you
[05:10] have the biggest pools of capital coming
[05:12] into this and you can see Bitcoin
[05:13] entering the public market. You can see
[05:15] Bitcoin obviously going into the
[05:16] sovereign wealth funds and so there is a
[05:18] world where that compound annual growth
[05:20] rate is much stickier than maybe people
[05:22] otherwise would think. Now I don't think
[05:24] it's going to stay at 65%. you know, I
[05:27] also don't think it's going to be below
[05:28] 20% for the next 5 years. And so, if
[05:31] they continue to extrapolate that out,
[05:33] uh, compounding works wonders. You know,
[05:35] it's the eighth wonder of the world. You
[05:37] don't have to change that percentage
[05:38] that much. If you go from sub 20 to,
[05:40] let's say, 35 or 40% and you extend it
[05:44] from 5 years to 10 years, you get a
[05:46] very, very different number at the end
[05:47] of that time frame than you would
[05:48] otherwise if you just keep it at a lower
[05:50] rate for a shorter period of time. And
[05:52] so to me, I I think that when I see
[05:54] these guys talking about this stuff,
[05:55] they're so used to thinking about stocks
[05:58] and the bigger something gets, the more
[06:00] that that compound growth rate comes
[06:02] down. But Bitcoin does feel like the one
[06:04] asset in the world that is bucking a lot
[06:06] of these trends and it's very hard for
[06:07] folks to kind of wrap their head around
[06:09] how big it can get and how long this can
[06:11] last for. Yeah. And I I completely
[06:14] disagree with um the argument that as
[06:18] this gets bigger, it's going to take
[06:20] more to move it and the Kaker should
[06:22] come down. I actually think the Kaker is
[06:23] going to accelerate and I'll give you
[06:25] the reason why. So
[06:28] the Mag 7, I mean their numbers have
[06:31] been staggering. They already broke the
[06:32] the the law of diminishing returns as
[06:35] you get bigger. And the reason is again
[06:37] because of technology and exponential
[06:39] innovation. Exponential innovation leads
[06:41] to concentration of wealth in smaller
[06:45] places. We've already seen that. The
[06:47] problem is Bitcoin has not outperformed
[06:49] the mag 7 over the last 8 years. It's
[06:52] been competing with it. I think what is
[06:55] going to happen is as we end up in a
[06:57] point where the public markets start to
[07:00] underperform,
[07:01] the private markets that never go
[07:03] public, which is what is beginning to
[07:05] happen, more and more people will equate
[07:08] the Bitcoin market cap as the disruption
[07:10] to the public markets. It's a new
[07:12] capital structure. Bitcoin is the base
[07:15] layer of the new capital structure. So,
[07:17] I believe network effects are going to
[07:19] accelerate this year because of stable
[07:20] coins. They mentioned that. Okay, great.
[07:23] So you're going to have more activity
[07:24] happening in the digital economy.
[07:26] Digital money is going to transact and
[07:28] it's all based on disrupting the
[07:29] incumbents to lower cost and be a
[07:32] decentralized force. The entrepreneurs,
[07:34] the people getting fired are going to
[07:35] move into they still have to make money.
[07:38] They're going to have to make money one
[07:39] of two ways. Either they're going to
[07:40] have to invest and they're not going to
[07:41] invest in the public markets. They're
[07:43] going to invest in what's working. And
[07:44] we keep driving more and more people
[07:46] that are angry just like you did with
[07:48] unions after the industrial revol
[07:49] revolution more towards Bitcoin. So I
[07:52] see Bitcoin as again being this place
[07:54] that is actually the direct result of AI
[07:58] accelerating just like we saw the cloud
[08:01] just like we saw mobile disrupting more
[08:03] and more employees and the labor share
[08:05] continuing to be under pressure. So I
[08:07] think this is actually going to drive
[08:08] more people into it at a time where like
[08:11] you said and I wrote a paper on this my
[08:12] substack so far Bitcoin's accumulated to
[08:15] the market cap it is driven mainly by a
[08:18] bottoms up movement. It has not been a
[08:20] top- down movement, meaning the
[08:21] wealthiest people of the fiat system
[08:23] have no reason to invest in it. So, they
[08:25] haven't moved. What CO2 signals to me is
[08:28] they're looking at it. They still don't
[08:29] understand how it fits. I'm reaching out
[08:31] to them now and saying this is a
[08:33] disruption of public businesses and
[08:36] Bitcoin represents this other digital
[08:38] economy world. And that's why I always
[08:40] say that is the S&P 500 of the future,
[08:43] not the public markets. Yeah. Well, I
[08:46] mean, just use Bitcoin. It's the hurdle
[08:47] rate, right? If you can't beat it, you
[08:49] got to buy it. And I think that people
[08:50] are now starting to recognize um there
[08:52] is this uh highly sensitive asset to
[08:56] global money supply um into debasement.
[08:59] And if that is really your true hurdle
[09:01] rate is you have to at least be
[09:02] outperforming uh that debasement rate,
[09:05] using inflation as the measurement
[09:06] obviously doesn't make a lot of sense.
[09:08] And so I think that you're going to
[09:09] continue to see people who want to uh
[09:11] find kind of a new benchmark. And
[09:13] Bitcoin seems to be that thing. Yeah.
[09:14] One thing they said that I don't I want
[09:16] to make sure we we hit on and I don't
[09:18] think you've seen the entire thing or
[09:19] maybe you didn't spend as much time on
[09:20] it. They did get into this aspect that
[09:22] AI could solve the debt to GDP problem.
[09:25] And there's a nuance in here which again
[09:28] I don't agree with. They didn't answer
[09:30] why debt to GDP has been rising and you
[09:33] just hit on it and for everyone watching
[09:35] debt to GDP is rising because of the
[09:37] distribution of wealth gap. So, I wrote
[09:40] about this and this is a big step on my
[09:42] journey from a top- down basis of
[09:43] understanding what why Bitcoin's been
[09:45] growing, but more importantly why debt
[09:47] to GDP has been growing. Bitcoin came
[09:50] out before debt to GDP really started to
[09:52] accelerate exponentially. It's been
[09:54] lined up with technology. The more you
[09:56] disrupt workers, the more the government
[09:59] has to subsidize and has to come in with
[10:02] more money to help those people. And it
[10:04] comes at a time when we're already going
[10:06] to see debt to GDP getting higher just
[10:08] because of the health of the country. Do
[10:10] I think 5 years from now that AI will
[10:11] start to impact that? Yes. But I think
[10:14] the next 5 years is a little bit more of
[10:16] a dystopia. It's a it's a painful point
[10:20] where AI accelerates so fast and
[10:22] companies are out there trying to get
[10:24] rid of employees to keep their profit
[10:26] margins higher and small businesses are
[10:27] having trouble compete. I actually don't
[10:29] think the next 5 years is reducing the
[10:31] pressure on debt to debt to GDP. I think
[10:33] it's actually increasing it.
[10:36] One of the other aspects uh I think that
[10:38] has surprised people is everyone was
[10:39] predicting the recessions, the
[10:40] depressions, and the Black Fridays. Uh
[10:42] now it looks like Q2 is going to be a
[10:44] bonanza 3 4% GDP print. Um I think that
[10:47] some of that as you've previously
[10:49] mentioned is a recovery from Q1. Um but
[10:52] also it does feel like now that we're
[10:53] getting some of this economic data uh
[10:55] people are starting to think very
[10:57] differently about uh the economy and
[10:58] what the rest of this year looks like.
[11:00] the Fed, they seem to not be very
[11:03] worried. They're not cutting rates. They
[11:04] are uh kind of steady Eddie. Um
[11:07] obviously the administration is yelling
[11:09] and screaming at Jerome Powell almost on
[11:11] a daily basis now saying he should be
[11:12] fired or he's behind the curve, etc. How
[11:15] do you look at the economic data, the
[11:16] GDP print, uh kind of this jobs uh
[11:19] softness that we're starting to see, and
[11:21] then uh what that means for the Fed and
[11:22] their decision not to cut rates this
[11:24] week?
[11:25] Yeah. So, um,
[11:28] we've talked about this before, but just
[11:30] to make the economy much simpler to kind
[11:32] of think about, let's just take the AI
[11:34] investment side, which is massive. Let's
[11:36] take the profit margin side, which means
[11:40] earnings grow, and let's go to wealthy
[11:42] people, that means they keep spending.
[11:45] It's really hard to have a recession
[11:47] with that going on. Um, it's not about,
[11:50] you know, unless we're having severe job
[11:51] losses and the stock market is down. If
[11:54] profit margins are growing and nominal
[11:56] GDP is staying there 5% which is what's
[11:58] happening all of this stuff about
[12:00] recession is just ridiculous uh it's not
[12:03] possible. Do I think the economy is
[12:05] growing rapidly? No. What I think is
[12:07] happening is the AI portion of the
[12:09] economy is fueling the entire movement
[12:12] right now. So whatever percent of
[12:15] nominal GDP I think AI is responsible
[12:17] for 75 80 90% of it between the capex
[12:21] from the hyperscalers between again the
[12:23] profit margins for the S&P 500 which is
[12:25] at the expense of workers it's at the
[12:28] expense of wages it's at the expense of
[12:30] all of this stuff what it leaves the
[12:32] median person in the country is in this
[12:35] point where we still have the inflation
[12:37] sitting at the levels that we did back
[12:39] from co they haven't come down food
[12:41] prices haven't come down Nothing has
[12:43] really come down at this point in any
[12:45] meaningful way. And now with oil, you're
[12:47] going to see pressure, gas at the pump,
[12:49] and you're going to see oil, unless it
[12:50] comes down quickly. Uh, and we have an
[12:52] end to the war very, very quickly
[12:53] because we've taken oil prices up,
[12:55] diesel prices are going up, and gas at
[12:57] the pump probably has another 20 to 30
[12:59] cents to go. It's already up, uh, 10
[13:01] cents or 3% from where it was. So, I
[13:04] think the median voter in the country is
[13:06] still suffering. I don't want to say a
[13:08] recession, but let's just say a an
[13:11] environment where they can work, but
[13:13] they don't feel like they'll necessarily
[13:16] have the same job in a year. And I think
[13:17] that's the best way I can kind of frame
[13:20] this is everyone's worried about AI. I
[13:22] get asked questions all the time through
[13:24] email, through chats, through Twitter
[13:26] DMs about people that are like, "Hey,
[13:28] can you do something to show me how my
[13:30] kids can survive this?" I think people
[13:32] are more worried. And that just means
[13:34] soft consumer spending at the bottom
[13:36] 50%. But because we're a topheavy, you
[13:40] know, portion of the economy, as long as
[13:41] the S&P 500 is going up 7% a year, I'm
[13:44] not even saying 20, I'm saying seven,
[13:46] you just can't have a recession. So it
[13:48] might feel like a recession to the
[13:49] bottom 50%, but it doesn't to the top
[13:51] 50. And when you see that um I remember
[13:55] there was a interview that Scott
[13:57] Bessant, Treasury Secretary did, um I
[13:59] think it was with Chimamoth and David
[14:00] Freriededberg uh early on and he was
[14:04] asked whether he believed the economic
[14:06] data. He said no and then very quickly
[14:08] kind of uh polished his answer. Um but
[14:10] they were talking about this idea that
[14:11] all the polls, all the data said one
[14:13] thing, but then when you went and talked
[14:15] to people, they told you a different
[14:16] story. They felt something that that was
[14:18] different. And there's always the
[14:19] example that like maybe people, you
[14:21] know, they they kind of don't believe
[14:22] the data because uh they're biased or
[14:25] they've got some sort of, you know,
[14:27] anecdotal experience that actually isn't
[14:29] true. But his point was, we can sit here
[14:32] and try to measure all this stuff as
[14:33] much as we want. But if people are
[14:34] telling us, I can't afford to buy a
[14:36] home, I can't afford food, I can't
[14:38] afford gas, I can't afford all this
[14:40] stuff, and we're sitting there saying
[14:41] like, what do you mean? Americans are
[14:43] better off today than they've ever been.
[14:44] He's like, there is a point in time
[14:47] where you have to go actually listen to
[14:49] the people and understand why is it that
[14:51] half the country is saying one thing but
[14:52] the data is telling us another thing.
[14:54] And it feels like that's what you're
[14:55] highlighting here is that both things
[14:57] can be true at the same time. The
[14:58] aggregate data can tell us one thing,
[15:00] but then there can be a very large
[15:01] portion of the population that has a
[15:03] completely different experience and is
[15:05] actually uh being hidden inside of that
[15:07] data in a way that maybe we don't have
[15:09] the sympathy or the empathy to really
[15:11] understand. Today's episode is sponsored

[16:06] by my partner Bitwise, the global crypto
[16:08] asset manager. Bitwise has $10 billion
[16:10] in client assets, a team of 100 plus
[16:12] people, and more than 30 crypto
[16:14] products. One more thing, they've also
[16:16] got one of the best weekly newsletters
[16:18] in crypto. I say that as someone who's
[16:21] no stranger to newsletters. Take it from
[16:22] me. Bitwise's weekly CIO memo is
[16:25] dynamite. The weekly CIO memo is written
[16:28] by Matt Hogan, one of the best minds in
[16:30] the business. Matt has a knack for
[16:31] seeing the crypto stories that people
[16:33] are missing or digging a level deeper on
[16:35] things like the strategic reserve,
[16:36] corporate Bitcoin buying, or crypto
[16:38] price predictions. I highly recommend
[16:40] it. Matt's got some really smart and
[16:42] bold takes and a lot of wit. And the
[16:44] memo takes just 5 minutes to read each
[16:46] week. So head over to
[16:47] bitwiseinvestments.com/cio
[16:50] memo. That's bitwiseinvestments.com/cio
[16:53] memo and check it out for yourself. The
[16:55] Bitweise weekly CIO memo. Hot takes on
[16:58] crypto's biggest stories. And always of
[17:00] course carefully consider the extreme
[17:02] risks associated with crypto. Both
[17:04] things can be true at the same time. The
[17:06] aggregate data can tell us one thing,
[17:08] but then there can be a very large
[17:09] portion of the population that has a
[17:10] completely different experience and is
[17:12] actually uh being hidden inside of that
[17:15] data in a way that maybe we don't have
[17:17] the sympathy or the empathy to really
[17:19] understand. Yeah. And you again I I
[17:22] think this is should be obvious to
[17:23] people. Let's go back to what we said
[17:25] about the rate of return that has
[17:27] happened for the MAG 7 relative to all
[17:30] other parts of the global market, the
[17:32] glo the global equity market, but also
[17:34] with inside the S&P 500. Does it feel
[17:37] like a bull market to Ford and GM and
[17:40] just go through the the amount of
[17:42] companies in the S&P 500 that are
[17:44] suffering? At the same time, the Mag 7
[17:47] have gone up exponentially. their market
[17:49] caps have risen just insanely since
[17:52] 2009. So what you're dealing with is if
[17:56] you take the S&P 500 and we hear all the
[17:59] time, well, you know, there's very few
[18:01] stocks going up. It's very concentrated.
[18:03] This is acting like a bare market. This
[18:05] is the way bare markets start. Use the
[18:07] same analogy for inflation. Use the same
[18:09] uh analogy for any part of GDP that you
[18:13] want. You can actually have the S&P 500
[18:15] going up, but with not many pe not many
[18:18] companies participating. You can have
[18:20] inflation going up slightly uh and you
[18:24] could have some things that are really
[18:25] really high like house prices as you
[18:27] brought up. Housing affordability has
[18:29] been at horrible levels and it remains
[18:30] at horrible levels. But you're starting
[18:33] to see because there's not a lot of
[18:35] people that can benefit or that can
[18:36] actually afford a home. you're starting
[18:38] to see house prices come down and it's
[18:41] there's a lot of people forecasting
[18:42] they'll be down this year. I don't know
[18:43] if we've ever had house prices down in a
[18:46] year and not had a recession. Um it's
[18:48] very difficult to have house prices down
[18:50] but somehow or another because the
[18:51] median voter cannot and I keep saying
[18:54] median voter because I want people to
[18:55] realize the middle person in the country
[18:58] is feeling the pain and the stock market
[19:00] is still going higher. So when you go
[19:02] through the S&P 500 the middle company
[19:04] in the S&P 500 is feeling the pain. the
[19:07] pain of higher rates, the pain of losing
[19:10] to the Mag 7, and the pain of not being
[19:13] able to embrace AI. The whole country is
[19:15] going through this. And that's why it's
[19:17] kind of like a recession in the way some
[19:19] people look. And if you say you can't
[19:21] trust the data, the reason they can't
[19:22] trust it is because what they think
[19:24] should be happening is not showing up in
[19:26] the data. And I think a lot of that is
[19:27] garbage in, garbage out, using
[19:29] historical models to model what isn't
[19:31] relevant anymore with AI.
[19:34] One of the aspects that we are getting
[19:35] clarity on is uh legislation, the Genius
[19:38] Act uh passed the Senate. Um this would
[19:40] give us a federal framework for stable
[19:42] coins. It feels like everyone is jumping
[19:45] head first into the stable coin game. Uh
[19:48] a couple of headlines over the last week
[19:50] or two. Amazon, Walmart, they are
[19:52] looking at potentially creating their
[19:53] own stable coin. Uh you have a 20-year
[19:56] veteran of Cityroup. He left Founders
[19:58] Fund backed him with about $10 million.
[20:00] Uh you also have uh the Tether $13.7
[20:04] billion in profit last year. The Circle
[20:06] IPO, they're up 300400% on that. Um you
[20:10] saw JP Morgan come out with the JPMD, I
[20:13] think they're calling it, u or the JMPD,
[20:16] uh which is a uh essentially like a
[20:18] commercial bank note that they're uh
[20:20] tokenizing. And the list goes on and on.
[20:22] I mean, there's tons of these things. I
[20:23] think Stripe uh announced that they are
[20:25] partnering much more deeply with Shopify
[20:28] and 34 different countries. Uh, Coinbase
[20:30] announced Coinbase payments. You know,
[20:31] it's just like we could talk about this
[20:33] for hours. Why is this happening? Is
[20:36] this just the technology is so good,
[20:38] it's a black hole and all companies, all
[20:40] talent eventually ends up with the
[20:41] stable coins or is there some other way
[20:43] to read the progress that's being made
[20:44] in this part of the market? Well, first
[20:47] of all, I I I think the most powerful
[20:49] thing to take out of this is people have
[20:51] to remember we're only two and a half
[20:54] years out of a mega bare market in
[20:56] crypto. Um, meaning you're you're
[20:59] talking about just 22 was an
[21:02] environment, and you know this better
[21:03] than I do, uh, where destruction was
[21:06] across the board. We're we're still
[21:07] getting through a lot of the lawsuits
[21:09] and and and bankruptcy cases. For this
[21:12] to be happening at this pace now, and I
[21:15] can remember the first time we did a
[21:17] show together, uh, and even before we
[21:19] did, I think in January I was on, I
[21:20] talked about this, the number one thing
[21:22] for this year was stable coins. And no
[21:24] one really knew how to make money off
[21:25] stable coins. Well, now all of a sudden
[21:27] you're starting to see, oh my gosh, so
[21:29] you can make it through Circle. Coinbase
[21:31] was up 16% on on uh I believe Wednesday.
[21:35] Uh anyone that even says stable coin at
[21:38] this point, everyone's kind of jumping
[21:39] through it. People have texted me
[21:41] saying, "Shouldn't Circle be $1 trillion
[21:43] market cap?" I mean, everyone is now
[21:46] getting completely on board. Here's my
[21:48] take simplistically.
[21:50] Uh stable coins are the bridge. They are
[21:54] the bridge between the traditional
[21:56] finance world, which means transactions,
[21:58] everything that goes into GDP. Digital
[22:02] money is not Bitcoin, but Bitcoin is
[22:04] about wallets. Bitcoin is about the
[22:07] thing that enabled this bridge to be
[22:09] built. And the more people that are
[22:11] getting involved in it, the more people
[22:13] that are going to allow, and I'm when I
[22:15] say people, the more that companies are
[22:17] going to allow individuals to transact,
[22:19] that money is going to end up in the
[22:21] digital economy. It's going to be
[22:23] digitally native. And that's why for me,
[22:26] this is exactly the network effects that
[22:28] I expected to happen. Part of this is
[22:30] individuals, but part of this is going
[22:31] to be set up through AI agents. The same
[22:34] way that I never really had to deal with
[22:36] my wallet in my iPhone to just start
[22:38] tapping things. It just kind of
[22:40] happened. Well, the fact that that
[22:41] already happened, and I'm not kidding, I
[22:43] I never It's not like I sat down one day
[22:45] and said, "You know what? I'm gonna go I
[22:46] I really got to investigate this wallet
[22:48] thing." No, I just connected a a a
[22:50] credit card to it and I started tapping
[22:52] and I realized that in most dinners now
[22:55] paying there was a true story that
[22:57] yesterday on the holiday we had here I
[22:59] went out to a really nice dinner and I
[23:01] looked around. I'm like, "Oh, I didn't
[23:02] bring my wallet and I said I use my
[23:05] phone for everything. I literally
[23:07] stopped carrying my wallet and I didn't
[23:09] bring my backpack that I normally
[23:10] bring." So, I think that's what's
[23:12] happening is stable coins are just kind
[23:14] of that ability for everyone to jump on
[23:17] board, realize that if they want to get
[23:20] the consumers to use it, they need to
[23:22] have it. And so everyone from a bank, I
[23:25] mean, when Walmart, when when Amazon,
[23:27] when Shopify, when those three companies
[23:29] in a single week are openly talking
[23:31] about it, when Uber is talking about it,
[23:34] I mean, I can't think of anything more
[23:35] powerful in terms of the movement we're
[23:37] having and what it means to again the
[23:39] public market companies because they're
[23:41] the ones that are going to suffer from
[23:42] this.
[23:44] I interviewed this week uh Parinho who
[23:46] is the Tether CEO and one of the things
[23:48] that was really interesting is uh we
[23:49] talked about the circle IPO and I asked
[23:51] him I said you know based on those
[23:53] multiples uh you guys would be pretty
[23:54] valuable and he had a number of
[23:56] different you know uh frameworks to
[23:58] think about valuation but he said look
[23:59] you know there's a world where tether is
[24:01] worth $2 trillion given the performance
[24:04] of the business and and some of the
[24:05] assets they own and at first you're kind
[24:07] of like what do you come on stop it like
[24:08] a two trillion dollar company and you
[24:10] start thinking about it you're like he's
[24:11] probably not far off and I think that
[24:14] that's just one company in this space.
[24:16] You add in the circles all these big
[24:18] banks and so it does feel like it's
[24:20] going to come down to the challengers
[24:22] versus the incumbents and the banks are
[24:24] not going to just like roll over and
[24:26] give up this market and so they feel
[24:28] like here they come. Uh JP Morgan
[24:31] obviously announcing this like a
[24:32] commercial bank note is is maybe one
[24:34] step but I got to imagine that you are
[24:37] going to see many of these banks figure
[24:39] out do they build something? Do they buy
[24:41] something? Do they partner together with
[24:43] other banks? Like how do they use the
[24:45] advantages that they have to box these
[24:47] challengers out? And it's going to be
[24:49] fascinating because maybe just the
[24:51] market has already spoken. You know, the
[24:53] taxi uh kind of conglomerate tried real
[24:56] hard to keep Uber out. Just people
[24:58] wanted Uber, right? And and that might
[25:00] be what happens here is that people just
[25:01] want non-bank stable coins um both
[25:04] internationally and domestically. All
[25:06] right. So, I'm not going to comment on
[25:08] what you just said cuz I completely
[25:10] agree and I think we we've hammered this
[25:12] point home that the merging of if you
[25:14] haven't spent time on stable coins,
[25:15] which I know a lot of people that are in
[25:17] the more traditional finance still have
[25:18] not spent time. I literally have a
[25:20] vision of just a bridge between these
[25:22] two worlds and the bridge is being built
[25:23] as we we see. One of the things that I I
[25:26] I haven't done this on this show. I want
[25:28] to ask you a question. So, how do you
[25:30] think about if stable coins are going to
[25:32] explode and we're going to be doing five
[25:34] times the amount of volume by the end of
[25:37] this year that we're already doing right
[25:38] now because of this? What about
[25:40] Ethereum? What about a Salana? What
[25:41] about all the guard rails that are
[25:43] supposed to be benefiting from the
[25:45] volume expansion? They're critical in my
[25:47] views of what'll happen to Bitcoin
[25:48] before the end of the year. I think that
[25:50] is the next phase of this. This has been
[25:53] my view is that as stable coins explode,
[25:55] we should start seeing the energy behind
[25:57] this with Ethereum and Salana and SU and
[25:59] all the other the components. How are
[26:01] you thinking about this?
[26:04] I don't know if the stable coin thing
[26:06] plays as much into this thesis as uh uh
[26:08] maybe as in general the second that
[26:11] everyone thinks like altcoin season is
[26:14] not coming, it will show up, right? And
[26:19] Bitcoin has done such a great job of
[26:21] sucking the air out of the room. Uh and
[26:23] rightfully so. It's the king. It will
[26:25] always be the king. I think that it has
[26:27] really ascended to uh an asset that now
[26:30] is accepted on Wall Street. But I do
[26:33] think that you're going to see people
[26:34] push out onto that risk curve in the
[26:36] second half of this year. And as we get
[26:39] further in the year, it means that that
[26:41] like alt season is more compressed. And
[26:44] so what you're going to likely get is
[26:45] you're going to get this very like
[26:47] reflexive move up and then you're going
[26:49] to get a very violent move down over
[26:51] time. And you know it goes back to the
[26:55] people who I tend to see playing in that
[26:57] space uh they're more traders or
[26:59] short-term optimized you know uh uh kind
[27:02] of strategies. The folks that are just
[27:04] hey I'm holding something for 30 years.
[27:06] They're holding Bitcoin. And so there's
[27:08] many ways up the mountain of success
[27:10] right? you you know there will be people
[27:12] who make money in both of those uh kind
[27:13] of worlds but I agree with you that
[27:16] there is you know it's not a very long
[27:18] tale it's not like there's a hundred
[27:19] assets maybe there's five or six that
[27:21] will benefit from stable coins they will
[27:23] benefit from people wanting to push out
[27:24] on the risk curve you know as Bitcoin is
[27:26] run um and then also you're starting to
[27:29] see it now in the public market with the
[27:30] Bitcoin treasury companies now you're
[27:32] starting to see the Ethereum treasury
[27:34] company the Salana treasury company uh
[27:36] Tron is going public right I mean like
[27:39] they're all going to do this and it's
[27:41] the classic well like if it worked for
[27:42] Bitcoin why can't it work for fortcoin
[27:45] and I promise you somebody is going to
[27:47] create a memecoin there there's a guy in
[27:49] Canada um that is uh he's the chairman
[27:52] of soul strategies guy Tony G and Tony
[27:56] um who you know I'm his friend we work
[27:58] together on the soul strategy stuff but
[28:00] Tony had another company and he recently
[28:02] turned it into a hyperlquid treasury
[28:04] strategy and so naturally all the people
[28:06] who are interested in hyperlquid they're
[28:08] now here they come right and so I do
[28:10] think that you're going to see that kind
[28:11] of like eat the tail of crypto and so
[28:14] whether it's the public companies or a
[28:15] private like these things are going to
[28:17] get a bid um even if you don't think
[28:18] that they're sustainable. What do you
[28:20] what do you think? You agree with that
[28:21] or no? Yeah, I I agree with it and I
[28:24] think the important message and I and
[28:26] I'll say this more from the So we have
[28:28] the merging of the traditional finance
[28:30] world and the crypto world coming
[28:31] together in a very powerful way. This is
[28:33] not the crypto um tokens and speculation
[28:38] going higher driving in
[28:41] the traditional finance world. Um this
[28:43] one is actually happening very
[28:45] differently. So you mentioned just kind
[28:47] of how this alt token season alt season
[28:51] token we were kind of in it after Trump
[28:54] took over and then it collapsed. The
[28:57] reason I'm so interested in it is cuz
[28:59] we're seeing it right now with circle.
[29:01] There's no doubt in my mind that Circle
[29:03] is kind of this energy that's going that
[29:06] is cryptoreated, but it's in the
[29:08] traditional finance world. There are
[29:10] people that have made money on it now.
[29:12] They're doing the research. They're
[29:13] thinking about it. The CO2 report just
[29:15] came out. I think the more that people
[29:17] spend time on it, they may go back to
[29:18] some of these all-in podcasts where,
[29:20] hey, didn't Shimoth say that stable,
[29:22] this would be the year of stable coins?
[29:24] Didn't Pomp and Jordy talk about the
[29:26] fact that this would be stable coins and
[29:27] the network effects are starting? I
[29:29] actually think that Ethereum having an
[29:31] ETF is like a very big positive in this
[29:34] whole thing. I think the traditional
[29:35] finance world is going to help fuel this
[29:38] along with the people with inside the
[29:41] token world that are waiting for
[29:43] something and a breath to happen. On my
[29:45] video last week, I highlighted that
[29:47] almost every single token is down
[29:49] between 20 and 50% this year. So, when
[29:52] you're down 20 and 50% year-to- date,
[29:54] and that's only year to date, that means
[29:56] you're down even more from when Trump
[29:58] was elected, I think the next phase when
[30:01] Ethereum, I'm going to say it closes two
[30:03] weeks above 2700 because that's the
[30:05] level I've been looking at. Um, once we
[30:07] close two weeks above there, I think
[30:10] it'll be the kickoff for the alt season.
[30:12] So, So, you think that we need Ethereum
[30:15] to close above 2700 for two weeks and
[30:17] that will kick off the alt season? I
[30:18] think it need it's it's it broke above
[30:21] uh last week and then it came back down
[30:23] but I think the enthusiasm behind circle
[30:26] and again I my kind of world on this is
[30:29] that AI agents are accelerating token
[30:32] usage is accelerating it's not just uh
[30:35] Sacha Nadella that said it sundar pai
[30:38] said it recently like we're getting
[30:40] explosion AI agents are coming AI AI
[30:43] agents are critical to the explosion of
[30:44] stable coins so stable coins growth
[30:46] right now is not happening from AI
[30:48] agents It may be starting that way but I
[30:50] think the convergence between stable
[30:52] coin usage and volumes exploding in a
[30:54] manner that everyone has to start doing
[30:56] a valuation calculation on it. I think
[30:58] it feeds back in that's why I asked you
[31:00] about Ethereum and Salana because there
[31:01] is a relationship between the volumes
[31:04] happening and Ethereum and Salana and SU
[31:07] and Tron and all these other pieces. So
[31:09] if you get that energy component
[31:11] associated with it and people start
[31:13] drilling down, they do have access to it
[31:15] through the ETFs and like you said, it's
[31:17] starting in the treasury side. So I
[31:18] think this is a broadening out move. So
[31:20] yeah, two weeks above 2700 and I think
[31:22] it's the kickoff. Let's talk about uh
[31:25] AI. You and I uh we woke up earlier this
[31:27] week and uh Irvin from Perplexity, the
[31:30] founder and CEO, uh he had posted a clip
[31:33] of us talking about Perplexity and AI,
[31:36] etc., which was which was fun and cool.
[31:38] Um I think you and I both have gotten to
[31:40] know him and the team over there. Uh
[31:42] what is your takeaway from uh Perplexity
[31:45] in particular? It seems like they have
[31:48] really use these AI models to
[31:50] significantly change the way that uh
[31:53] people are able to get information. I
[31:55] mentioned to you earlier that Howard
[31:56] Marx, the famed investor and memo
[31:59] writer. Uh, you know, now every time I
[32:01] talked about a successful uh, investor,
[32:03] I'm going to reference whether they're a
[32:05] podcaster, an influencer, or a memo
[32:07] writer because that seems to be the uh,
[32:09] the thing for the young guys. And so
[32:11] Howard Marx used Perplexity to write
[32:13] part of his memo. And he explained that
[32:15] he was using it, but it was pretty damn
[32:17] good compared to his normal writing
[32:19] style. And so, how do you see this all

[33:38] I you know I said it last week um and
[33:40] for the perplexity team I'll say it
[33:42] again. it has replaced 60% of my
[33:45] Bloomberg usage. I have a lot of uh
[33:49] thoughts and ideas on how it can replace
[33:52] more of it. The one thing I've used as
[33:55] kind of a a comparison side, I remember
[33:58] in 2009 and 2010, and if you remember if
[34:01] if you didn't see it, uh in this theme,
[34:04] Bloomberg verse Perplexity, I would go
[34:06] watch the the Blackberry movie that came
[34:09] out. I don't know if you saw it. uh
[34:11] great movie on kind of a tool that the
[34:13] financial world used which is the most
[34:15] similar I can say to Bloomberg meaning
[34:18] everyone liked the keyboard on the
[34:20] Blackberry. So it was a very very slow
[34:23] change
[34:24] to the iPhone. Part of it was security
[34:27] just like perplexity. Part of it was
[34:29] people not really thinking about needing
[34:33] to use it or all the benefits that came.
[34:35] What I think is going to happen with
[34:37] Perplexity, uh, and I already see it
[34:39] happening and the team should really
[34:41] spend time with me on this, uh, the
[34:44] community of Perplexity should be
[34:48] building the competition. I already have
[34:50] things built in that I'm showing hedge
[34:52] funds. Uh I believe most of the AI
[34:55] platforms will have some form of a
[34:57] community-based app store for the people
[34:59] who are using it because I've always
[35:01] said domain expertise plus creativity
[35:04] plus curiosity leads to an app store
[35:07] that is basically rep it it it's a brain
[35:10] store. You're getting someone else's
[35:11] brain. The whole way that AI is going to
[35:14] democratize things in my opinion is to
[35:16] use other people's brains the users not
[35:19] the companies. That is the power of AI
[35:21] is to find people who use it because if
[35:23] I said to you this is how I use it in
[35:25] perplexity.
[35:27] It's stuff that I figured out that I
[35:29] rabbit hole in and I can go get down to
[35:31] the bottom and I know you've used it in
[35:32] the same way. I can get lost in a
[35:34] conversation with both Perplexity and
[35:37] Chat GPT while walking down the street
[35:39] to talk about the things that we talk
[35:41] about here. When I read the code report,
[35:43] I had about a 30-minute conversation
[35:45] with Chat GPT about what I thought in
[35:48] the report. it had the report. So I was
[35:50] having a conversation on something that
[35:52] was released two weeks ago and I'm
[35:54] having a conversation on my views that
[35:56] are different than that one and it led
[35:58] to kind of some of the thoughts we
[35:59] shared here today. I do the same thing
[36:01] with perplexity maybe less so with the
[36:03] voice mode side but building tools to
[36:06] look at charts to set up workspaces to
[36:08] set up the ability to do it. And so
[36:10] every time I hear a Bloomberg user say I
[36:11] don't know how you're getting to that
[36:13] level. I can't access a where a current
[36:16] CDS is on Perplexity. I can't access
[36:19] when the debt maturity is on this.
[36:22] Great. There's no way at this point that
[36:24] it should be able to rep replicate
[36:26] everything that you can do in Bloomberg.
[36:27] But Bloomberg cannot do the stuff that
[36:30] Perplexity can. So, you have to kind of
[36:32] look at it both ways. I said 6040. The
[36:35] reason I said 60/40 is because the fact
[36:38] data and the company uh commentary I can
[36:41] get instantaneous and then I can be in
[36:43] another company and another company and
[36:44] another company with similar commentary.
[36:47] There's no comparison to me. Perplexity
[36:49] has already beaten Bloomberg on the
[36:50] ability of going lateral with thoughts
[36:53] as opposed to being locked in a silo. At
[36:57] some point, do you think that whether
[36:58] it's Perplexity or somebody else will
[37:00] eventually just invest money as well?
[37:02] Like we saw the rise of the robo
[37:03] advisors, but those are really just kind
[37:05] of like indexers to to a degree. Um, if
[37:09] you can train the model to answer
[37:10] questions that you then are using to go
[37:12] and make investment decisions, is it
[37:15] that crazy to think the natural
[37:16] extension is that it can learn from
[37:18] those questions you're asking it and
[37:20] eventually be able to allocate the
[37:21] capital itself?
[37:24] Eventually, we will get there. Um, I
[37:26] think the human element is still very
[37:29] important to people. So, there is a
[37:31] separation between it ever being
[37:32] full-blown robo adviser, but I think
[37:34] with younger people, they don't care as
[37:36] much. for older people who still who
[37:38] still control most of the the money of
[37:40] the world, they need that personal kind
[37:41] of handholding touch. But if there's a
[37:44] verbal conversation, and that's why I
[37:46] always say if you use voice mode,
[37:48] it changes things. That's why when I
[37:50] wrote the paper that if you want to get
[37:51] started with AI, the first thing to do
[37:52] is to just talk to it. And I say build a
[37:55] relationship. And I think it kind of
[37:56] freaks people out, but the way that you
[37:59] use it is the way that you use it. I I I
[38:02] mean, if you look at a golf swing and
[38:04] you take a hundred people, their golf
[38:07] swings are all completely different. Um,
[38:09] for the golf fans out there, Scotty
[38:10] Sheffller's feet move like nobody I've
[38:12] ever seen move. He's the best golfer in
[38:14] the world. Everyone's golf swing is
[38:15] different. Everyone is a user of AI is
[38:18] completely different. When you get into
[38:20] software and you're pressing buttons and
[38:22] it's doing things for you, there's not
[38:24] as much creativity. I I I do want to add
[38:26] one more thing because
[38:29] you've had experience with this. I've
[38:30] had experience with this when I think of
[38:33] and I'll just use perplexity again but
[38:35] if I connect perplexity to cursor that's
[38:37] where I am in my brain meaning I want to
[38:40] build the applications and the tools
[38:43] that I want to have in perplexity or
[38:45] connected to perplexity that's what
[38:47] we're getting to is how do I create the
[38:49] software that I would otherwise use that
[38:51] I'm in their world risk management tools
[38:54] turbulence tools things that I've always
[38:56] wanted to build that I would have data
[38:57] scientists build for me or pay software
[38:59] vendors for now I'm going to be able to
[39:01] create them myself. There's no right
[39:03] answer to those questions. But when you
[39:04] create an app yourself by verbally going
[39:07] through it and then you connect it back
[39:08] to your workflow and if that workflow
[39:10] like GitHub or anything where you can
[39:12] then go out there and offer it to other
[39:14] people in a brain form, I really do
[39:16] think with everything we're talking
[39:18] about, it's going to become very very
[39:20] personalized and people will be building
[39:22] their own solutions as opposed to
[39:23] depending on solutions.
[39:25] The last thing I want to talk about
[39:26] today is uh Israel and Iran. Um there's
[39:30] been a lot of rockets flying back and
[39:31] forth. Uh ballistic missiles. Um the
[39:34] Iron Dome was penetrated. Uh there was
[39:37] also uh some very surgical strikes from
[39:39] Israel and Iran. Um there has been uh a
[39:42] fracturing I think of uh the Republican
[39:45] parties uh kind of thoughts on uh
[39:48] whether this should be done, should not
[39:49] be done. Um there's always going to be
[39:53] high debate and controversy whenever you
[39:55] overlay religion, philosophy, politics,
[39:59] and economics, right? And there's
[40:01] probably other things in overlaid there
[40:02] as well, but at least those four things
[40:03] are kind of four core pillars to this
[40:05] whole thing.
[40:07] How does an investor navigate what is
[40:09] happening and seems to be changing on an
[40:11] almost daily basis, including the
[40:13] president of the United States tweeting
[40:14] like, "We know where the Ayatollah is
[40:16] and we're not going to kill him yet, but
[40:18] you know, you should be scared." uh
[40:19] which is um you know kind of like a we
[40:22] could do things but we're not going to
[40:24] do things but we want you to know we
[40:25] could do those things. Um which only
[40:28] kind of muddies the water for an
[40:29] investor. Yeah. I again I I
[40:33] say it all the time on on my videos. I'm
[40:35] sure I said it here last week when we
[40:37] briefly talked about it. You don't make
[40:39] any money um extrapolating geopolitics
[40:42] into earnings in the economy. Uh so what
[40:45] could happen there to impact investors
[40:47] here and why does the market care at
[40:49] all? The market cares because of the
[40:51] price of oil. The market cares for the
[40:53] possibility that World War II could
[40:55] start. So what's the probability of
[40:57] those events? They're both low. I think
[40:59] the oil or the straits of Hormuz is
[41:02] rising in probability. And that's seen
[41:04] through a couple of ways, but let's just
[41:06] take oil back at at $65
[41:09] um and say now it's at $75.
[41:12] Most people say it'll go to 120 if the
[41:15] straits of Hormuz are shut down. Um
[41:17] whether or not that's true or not is
[41:18] irrelevant, but that means there's right
[41:20] now a very small probability still built
[41:22] in. If we've had a $10 rise and they
[41:24] think there could be another $45 rise,
[41:26] let's say it's somewhere between 15 and
[41:28] 20% to go to just make it a simple
[41:30] straight line probability uh in there. I
[41:32] I don't think investors should care. The
[41:35] second thing is if oil did spike uh I
[41:37] think very quickly it would come back
[41:39] down because that's what happens with
[41:40] almost every oil spike. Meaning if they
[41:43] did something I think that forces the US
[41:45] in I think it forces a lot of other
[41:47] countries to get in there because it
[41:48] changes the dynamic. So for me I have
[41:51] always viewed geopolitics as a way to
[41:54] take advantage of the opportunity that
[41:57] it presents because very very seldom in
[41:59] history does it turn into anything
[42:00] meaningfully bigger or important. It
[42:03] happens to come at a time when the S&P
[42:04] is sitting right near the all-time
[42:06] highs. It happens to come at a time when
[42:08] the blackout period for buybacks is
[42:09] about to kick in. Uh buybacks have been
[42:12] averaging anywhere from 5 to7 billion
[42:15] dollar a day of demand because of how
[42:17] big they are. Uh when they go into a
[42:20] blackout period, the market isn't going
[42:22] to have that steady demand. Sentiment
[42:24] has normalized to at least around
[42:26] bullish bearish, but maybe 50/50. So, I
[42:29] still think we're going to stay around
[42:30] here. Maybe we correct for a little bit
[42:32] and then we go higher. But I think for
[42:34] investors, if they watch the news and
[42:36] they see the bombs going off and a
[42:37] hospital gets hit or uh an energy plant
[42:40] gets hit or there threats of nukes, I
[42:42] think you're going to make your rational
[42:44] decisions. And I think at the end of the
[42:45] day, you just always focus on the
[42:47] structural things that are happening. AI
[42:49] is happening, earnings are good, GDP is
[42:52] fine. we need to see oil go up
[42:54] significantly, but there's probably a
[42:56] reaction function that happens, which
[42:58] means if the S&P did fall, I would be
[43:00] looking to put money in that. The only
[43:01] thing I'll add is I will continue to
[43:04] reiterate the ven diagram. when you try
[43:06] to find two separate investment themes
[43:09] that are connecting. If Israel and Iran
[43:12] last for a long time and this isn't the
[43:14] beginning of something or the risk of it
[43:16] being there remains, which seems likely,
[43:19] then oil probably has a floor somewhere
[43:21] around 65. If it's going to stay at 65,
[43:25] people forget that energy stocks fell
[43:27] off because when the tariffs were on, we
[43:30] took oil from 65 down to 55. Well, if
[43:32] now we've put in a floor there, the
[43:35] second half of the year, token usage is
[43:37] going to explode. Stable coin usage is
[43:39] going to explode. Energy is going to be
[43:41] needed. I cannot say this loud enough to
[43:43] people. I just wrote a piece for 22V on
[43:45] Chevron and Exxon. Not because they're
[43:47] pure plays on AI or pure plays on power,
[43:50] but they're the two biggest parts of a
[43:52] sector that's only 3.5% of the S&P while
[43:55] technology is 50. Power, power, power is
[43:58] the theme for the second half of the
[43:59] year. and all that the Iran Israel thing
[44:00] does is put a floor under oil.
[44:03] I do think that there is a um a very
[44:06] interesting dynamic of um the United
[44:09] States went and took uh what is it our
[44:12] strategic petroleum reserve we
[44:14] significantly depleted that it seems
[44:16] like we are trying to fill that back up
[44:18] and and uh the price of oil going up.
[44:20] It's not necessarily helping um in terms
[44:23] of our abilities there. But also a huge
[44:26] part of Trump's kind of campaign
[44:29] platform was drill baby drill. And so
[44:32] you've got kind of the things happening
[44:34] in the Middle East which the United
[44:36] States on one hand, you know, could be
[44:38] benefiting from if we're selling the oil
[44:39] and oil prices are up, but on the other
[44:41] hand that drilling is not necessarily
[44:44] keeping the price at kind of a
[44:46] sustainable level. And so there's a lot
[44:48] of like interesting dynamics of not only
[44:50] you know just the oil price, but then
[44:52] how does this affect individual
[44:53] countries production? How does that
[44:55] affect importing versus exporting? And
[44:57] if you really, you know, kind of even go
[44:58] back a couple of years now, you also
[45:00] have the Russia Ukraine crisis. You
[45:03] have, you know, you kind of like start
[45:04] stacking this stuff up. And um on one
[45:07] hand, the fact that oil is not, you
[45:08] know, hundred plus dollars, uh is maybe
[45:11] surprising. Like you would think that
[45:13] there's been so much disruption, so many
[45:14] geopolitical conflicts that now are
[45:16] impacting oil itself. Um it's held in
[45:19] there maybe better than I would have
[45:20] expected. Yeah, I agree. And I I think
[45:24] you you've brought up a point and just
[45:25] so people know this like China and
[45:27] Russia are brought into the Iran Israel
[45:29] thing. So I think everyone gets the Iran
[45:32] uh Russia connection, but for China,
[45:35] China's been supporting their ability to
[45:38] sustain themselves by buying almost all
[45:40] of the exports that Iran has on the oil
[45:42] side. So there are relationships on this
[45:44] that make the geopolitics interesting
[45:46] from the global side. But I think it
[45:48] also makes it that China doesn't want
[45:50] Iran to be in a position where it can't
[45:52] export oil anymore and if it shuts down
[45:54] the straits of form moves it it ends up
[45:56] being a very very
[45:58] let's say messy situation. Uh it doesn't
[46:01] get a lot of press at the same time but
[46:03] Taiwan has been saying that they're
[46:05] noticing that China's drills are looking
[46:08] more real at this point around them. So
[46:10] I do think geopolitics is a part of the
[46:12] discussion always and we're at a more
[46:14] difficult and let's say risky time. But
[46:17] the probability of it escalating into
[46:18] something is still very low. If people
[46:20] want to do things at this point, you can
[46:23] still get long energy stocks. You can
[46:25] still get long uh puts on the S&P or at
[46:28] least do something uh if you're really
[46:31] worried because the stuff has not been
[46:32] built in. So when you say oil hasn't
[46:35] gone up too much, I completely agree. I
[46:37] also think that volatility and stuff
[46:39] hasn't gone up too much. So if there's
[46:40] any kind of escalation, you could see
[46:42] these things pick up. Is there anything
[46:44] else that you're paying attention to
[46:44] over the next, you know, week or two
[46:46] that uh that you think is worth calling
[46:47] out for people in advance?
[46:50] We haven't talked about it here much and
[46:53] you might have more to talk about this.
[46:55] I I I will say um for the next week it's
[46:59] about expirations. So today is quarterly
[47:02] expiration for um stocks, but Derbit has
[47:06] a massive expiration going on next week
[47:09] in Bitcoin. I I like I said, I think
[47:12] Ethereum is very close to breaking out
[47:14] here and I think if it coincides with
[47:15] Darabit options expiration, there has
[47:18] clearly been V selling that has gone on
[47:21] because we've seen V compress in Bitcoin
[47:23] below 40. It's at all-time lows uh in
[47:26] terms of implied volatility. You've got
[47:28] a lot of people that have been selling
[47:29] call options. I'm still living with the
[47:32] short squeeze side. I think Ethereum
[47:34] needs to break out. I also think we need
[47:35] to get through one of these expireies
[47:37] and then be in a situation where there's
[47:38] a catalyst. Well, now you have a
[47:40] catalyst that if there's any kind of
[47:42] negotiation between Iran and the US,
[47:44] Iran and Israel, and we get any pause in
[47:46] that, we're going to get the next move
[47:48] higher, that'll take us to all-time
[47:49] highs, I'm very certain of in the S&P.
[47:51] But then you're also going to start
[47:52] getting into earnings report for for Q2.
[47:55] And I think the AI earning stuff again,
[47:58] what we've seen from Broadcom, what
[48:00] we've seen from uh Nvidia, what we've
[48:04] seen from all of the companies that have
[48:06] come out, but in particular Oracle,
[48:08] Jable this week, we have Micron coming
[48:10] out uh I believe next week, if not next
[48:13] week, the the the following week. You're
[48:15] going to have more and more companies
[48:16] that are talking. So, I'm looking
[48:18] actually for that. But then I'm gonna
[48:19] throw it back at you on one thing.
[48:22] Cynthia Lumis,
[48:23] the senator said, "First thing we need
[48:26] to get done is the Genius Act." Okay, so
[48:29] we're through the Senate on that. We'll
[48:31] go through the House. Uh it was a
[48:33] bipartisan uh vote. Uh you had 68 I
[48:37] mean, when's the last time we had
[48:38] anything in in in the Senate that had 68
[48:41] votes, which means that enough Democrats
[48:43] jumped on board? Elizabeth Warren
[48:45] obviously did not. But what's coming up
[48:47] after? because we've still had a lot of
[48:48] speculation that they'll do something in
[48:50] in in Bitcoin, they'll do something in
[48:53] other parts. We got stage one done of
[48:55] her plan. She's talked openly about
[48:57] what'll be happening after that. Do you
[48:58] have any insights for anyone on uh on
[49:00] what you see happening after this bill
[49:02] bill goes through? Well, they definitely
[49:04] got, you know, the market structure and
[49:05] the stable coin bills. Um I recently
[49:07] talked with Patrick Mckenry, uh former
[49:09] chairman of the House Financial Services
[49:11] Committee, and he said that he thinks
[49:12] they should put them together um and
[49:14] just make one bill and and it looks like
[49:15] that's a possibility here. Uh I do think
[49:17] that buying more Bitcoin um is going to
[49:20] be something that happens in 2025. Let's
[49:22] see, you know, how long that takes. Um
[49:24] and then the other thing that uh frankly
[49:26] I I really see movement on is how banks
[49:29] can participate here. And it used to be
[49:31] that the regulators would go to the
[49:32] banks and say, "Hey, don't touch this
[49:34] stuff." And the banks said, "Well, we
[49:34] weren't going to touch it anyways." And
[49:36] you know, no problem. Uh whatever you
[49:38] say, you know, salute them and and move
[49:39] on. Now the banks are turning around and
[49:42] saying, "We're going to do this now."
[49:43] Like, you know, you better get out of
[49:44] our way. And uh I think that the
[49:46] regulators are kind of on their heels
[49:47] saying okay fine right we'll we'll
[49:49] figure out some rules and and let you
[49:50] guys do that. So everyone is very
[49:52] focused on what I'll call like the the
[49:54] structural stuff and the way that you
[49:56] know uh things that touch them. But I
[49:58] think that the banks are a really
[50:00] interesting area to watch because all of
[50:03] a sudden they can uh bring these
[50:06] products to to market. They have
[50:07] distribution. They already have the
[50:08] customer base. They already have the
[50:09] accounts. They have the assets. like
[50:11] there are some significant advantages
[50:13] that they can uh can capture there. I
[50:15] think that's really uh an area that uh
[50:17] maybe is not getting as much attention
[50:18] as it should. I I agree and the reason I
[50:20] asked the question is I believe the
[50:22] second half of the year is about the
[50:24] crypto space. I I think the first half
[50:26] people may have not realized but we were
[50:30] waiting for this bill for the entire
[50:32] first half of the year. There were
[50:33] people speculating that um there'd be
[50:36] Bitcoin purchases. Maybe everything just
[50:39] got delayed to the second half. the
[50:40] Circle IPO gets done, it brings a lot of
[50:42] enthusiasm. But more importantly,
[50:43] between the Circle IPO and the CO2
[50:46] report, eyeballs from the traditional
[50:48] finance world are migrating to crypto.
[50:51] And I think people are underestimating
[50:54] the amount of positive news that's going
[50:56] to come out that basically is being
[50:58] released because had to get everyone set
[51:00] up, had to get everyone through. Like we
[51:01] we just are getting this whole movement
[51:04] going. And I think when the meme coins
[51:06] and everything were flying through the
[51:08] roof from November until mid January, I
[51:11] think people might be falling asleep.
[51:12] And that's why I keep saying when
[51:13] Ethereum closes above 2700 for two
[51:15] weeks. Two weeks in a row where closes
[51:17] above 2700, I think we're we're setting
[51:20] up for a whole big second half of the
[51:22] year driven by a AI agent, stable coin,
[51:24] and more positive reception from the
[51:26] traditional finance world. That would be
[51:29] uh be fantastic. Where can we send
[51:30] people to find you on the internet? Uh
[51:32] you can find me posting on X. They can
[51:34] find me on YouTube at Vissor Labs. They
[51:36] can find me at my Substack. And of
[51:39] course, for the institutional crowd out
