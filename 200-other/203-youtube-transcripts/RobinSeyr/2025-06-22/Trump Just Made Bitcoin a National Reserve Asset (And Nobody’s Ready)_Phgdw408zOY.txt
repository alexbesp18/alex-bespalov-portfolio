[00:00] How am I so certain that Bitcoin is
[00:02] going up forever? I asked the question
[00:04] to the normie. Will governments and
[00:07] banksters ever stop printing money? The
[00:10] answer is no. Man, I wish I could tell
[00:12] every single one of my family members,
[00:13] just get a whole Bitcoin. That's all you
[00:15] will ever need for generational wealth.
[00:18] There is going to be such a huge supply
[00:21] shock because we say when America
[00:25] sneezes, the world catches a cold. So
[00:27] eventually when America starts huddling
[00:28] Bitcoin, all the other governments are
[00:30] going to do it and Trump already gave
[00:32] everybody the green light. And when you
[00:33] see it, you can't unsee it. The Bitcoin
[00:35] is the discover it digital scarcity and
[00:38] it's giving the power back to the
[00:39] people. I came across this thing called
[00:41] Bitcoin. And I noticed that it went from
[00:44] $20,000 to $65,000 in a period of a
[00:48] couple months. I'm like, what is this?
[00:51] And I remember from 2018 when I was in
[00:53] the pizzeria, I had heard about it in
[00:55] the TV and I shrugged it off. It was
[00:57] 2018. Man, if I could have bought some
[00:59] Bitcoin there. Bitcoin changed my life
[01:01] in countless ways because I used to be
[01:03] worried and afraid all the time. What
[01:05] What if I pass away? What if something
[01:07] happens to me? How are my children going
[01:09] to make a living? Well, Bitcoin is
[01:11] taking care of that for me.
[01:15] Imagine
[01:17] when there's five or 10 corporations and
[01:20] nation states, you know, and banks. So
[01:23] eventually everybody's going to want a
[01:25] million bitcoins, but there's only 21
[01:27] million bitcoins and I'm not selling. So
[01:30] that's a lot of people like you and me.
[01:32] It's so it's so fun to talk about that
[01:34] because it's like you have more and more
[01:38] actors that really want to gain more and
[01:40] more Bitcoin and especially they want to
[01:43] have Bitcoin in their own control and
[01:45] then it's like but there only 21 million
[01:47] at maximum there's been a loss. So like
[01:50] maybe we can calculate with like 18
[01:52] million or 50 million whatever the
[01:54] number is and you're like okay if
[01:56] there's like five micro strategies
[01:59] that's already too many that's already
[02:01] too many micro strategies they can only
[02:03] be one. Uh so the other ones have to
[02:05] fight for a lower amount. So it's at
[02:08] some point big companies will fight for
[02:10] like to get to 100,000 Bitcoin because a
[02:13] million is just like out of the way.
[02:15] Now, companies can still get there, but
[02:18] at some point it's like, oh yeah, you
[02:21] get to 10,000 Bitcoin as a big company,
[02:23] and that's a huge accomplishment. And
[02:26] then think about what it means if you
[02:28] have a whole coin as an individual or as
[02:31] a family. Do you think that a person can
[02:34] right now, do you think a person on
[02:37] average in Austria or let's say in
[02:40] Europe, do you think a a normal average
[02:43] working Joe in Europe can buy a whole
[02:46] Bitcoin? No, I I seriously don't think
[02:49] so. Uh I don't know the exact numbers. I
[02:52] looked it up once. But if you have I
[02:56] mean um if you go with the average maybe
[02:59] if they sell everything but they have to
[03:01] sell their house most like if you talk
[03:04] about middle class in Austria
[03:07] uh most of them save their life their
[03:10] lives energy in a house and most of the
[03:13] houses almost all of the houses in in
[03:16] Austria are worth more than a bitcoin
[03:18] right now.
[03:20] So they could probably uh if they really
[03:25] hustle, if they sell everything for
[03:29] Bitcoin and they really hustle for that
[03:32] um because Austria is is a small but um
[03:35] on average kind of a good country when
[03:37] you look at the net worth per per
[03:39] people. Um it's also like where do you
[03:43] draw the the average? Uh but I think the
[03:46] medium the the the middle class could
[03:50] realistically maybe still get there
[03:54] if 2025 isn't crazy.
[03:58] So if we are going fast to like 200 300
[04:01] 400,000
[04:02] then all of a sudden um forget what I'm
[04:06] just said and say like oh like it's it's
[04:08] no longer possible and it's already very
[04:10] hard. Uh, but I think most people still
[04:13] most people like the middle class could
[04:15] still get their the middle class in in
[04:20] people that are older than 30, older
[04:22] than 35 maybe maybe they're around 40
[04:25] because they usually have like some some
[04:27] assets uh and not relying only on
[04:31] savings, right? But I've met I've met uh
[04:34] 50 60 year old people and their only
[04:38] savings are like €10,000 in the bank.
[04:40] Yeah. They they don't get investing.
[04:42] They don't get assets. They don't get um
[04:44] not even talking about Bitcoin. They
[04:46] don't even get why an ETF is a good
[04:48] idea. Yeah. And the ETF is a way better
[04:50] idea than holding it in euros. Yeah. My
[04:53] my my daughter brings friends over the
[04:55] house all the time. Like dozens of of
[04:57] different little girls. They play
[04:59] around, you know, they they're outside.
[05:01] Go buy ice cream. I mention investing
[05:04] every time I can to them, you know, if
[05:07] it comes up, you know, oh, there comes
[05:10] Bitcoin Gus again, you know, but I tell
[05:12] them because I know that the schools
[05:14] aren't doing it and then and then
[05:16] they're going to grow up to be that
[05:17] average Joe middle class person in
[05:21] wherever you are really. I don't think
[05:22] any schools are doing it and they're not
[05:25] going to have assets. You know, they're
[05:26] not and then the the all the the fiat
[05:29] gets severely
[05:32] um severely devalued by the nation
[05:35] states and that's every nation state.
[05:36] You know, we we're very fortunate to
[05:38] live in the west where our money is
[05:40] actually worth something. You know, the
[05:42] euro is a powerhouse just like the the
[05:44] the dollar. For people who don't know,
[05:46] the euro is worth more than the dollar,
[05:48] right? So the the euro if if you live in
[05:51] Europe and I I'm an European citizen and
[05:54] I love Europe and one day I want to
[05:56] retire in Italy in the the Alps near you
[05:59] there by the Austria by Switzerland. Um
[06:02] people I think you know if you ask me
[06:07] people can still get in America to one
[06:10] Bitcoin. Um, and it and it I wish I wish
[06:14] I knew about, you know, getting to be a
[06:16] whole coiner back in in 2018 because
[06:20] then by now my company could have
[06:22] stacked the the whole Bitcoin, too,
[06:24] which I'm trying to do. That's why I ask
[06:26] you if you think it's possible for a
[06:28] person to stack a whole Bitcoin, though
[06:29] I personally have it. My company doesn't
[06:32] have it yet. Um, but I wish I could, you
[06:35] know, how do you convince people, you
[06:38] know? Well, there's no convincing them.
[06:40] Eventually, they're going to come to the
[06:42] realization that Bitcoin is the most
[06:44] important, most valued asset, most
[06:47] scarce asset in the world, you know? Uh,
[06:51] but how do you make people realize that
[06:54] that's the what they should get to
[06:56] immediately like yesterday?
[06:59] I I just looked it up because I was like
[07:01] I don't want to say BS on the podcast
[07:04] and actually was was right on the uh
[07:07] according to Google's AI I think Geminon
[07:09] it's called the average net wealth of
[07:11] Austrian households average uh is
[07:14] 293,000
[07:17] so the average household could
[07:19] definitely afford one bitcoin but the
[07:21] interesting thing is the difference
[07:22] between a between average and uh median.
[07:27] So median is like the the middle part
[07:29] like I'm not a statistics expert but
[07:32] like the average is just like taking
[07:33] everything and dividing by the people uh
[07:35] how many people there are and the median
[07:37] looks at like what is the middle like
[07:38] what's the uh point getting all the
[07:41] numbers on on what's like the middle
[07:42] number the median is significantly lower
[07:45] with 128,000
[07:47] that's right around where Bitcoin sits I
[07:49] mean like now Bitcoin sits like at like
[07:52] 90,000 but it's not that far away from
[07:54] it right now Most Austrians, so more
[07:58] than 50% of Austrians could get the one
[08:00] Bitcoin if they sell everything they
[08:02] have for Bitcoin, which means a lot
[08:05] already. So, uh I don't know how how is
[08:08] this in in the USA? I I've never looked
[08:11] it up. Yeah, I'm very surprised, man.
[08:13] Wow. In Austria, the average in media
[08:15] even the medium is above the United
[08:16] States. I think the um average salary in
[08:19] America, we're up to 75,000.
[08:23] Uh sorry, let's see here. I don't know.
[08:25] I have no clue if if that's
[08:27] representative, but like apparently the
[08:30] average net worth of the US household is
[08:31] a million. Oh wow. Yeah, I'm I'm not
[08:36] surprised. It says here that the um
[08:38] average income for the average household
[08:41] in America is $80,000, which makes
[08:43] sense. We're up by a lot. I think 5
[08:45] years ago was like $50,000. But there's
[08:48] obviously, you know, areas where the
[08:49] it's nicer places and more expensive
[08:52] places. But man, I wish I could tell
[08:55] every single one of my family members,
[08:56] just get a whole Bitcoin. That's all you
[08:58] will ever need for generational wealth.
[09:02] You know, it's super interesting. And
[09:04] and the median is actually also very
[09:06] close to uh where the one Bitcoin is.
[09:09] The median is currently at $190,000.
[09:12] Um so that's not that far away. It's
[09:14] like $90,000. It's like maybe a 2x away
[09:17] from that. But you also have to consider
[09:19] maybe there's some part of the wealth
[09:21] that you cannot even liquidate. Maybe
[09:23] there's some 41k lock up like whatever
[09:26] going on. So right now I would say 50%
[09:31] on based on the data that I'm seeing 50%
[09:33] of the people in the USA if they're
[09:36] really passionate about it and they're
[09:38] really convinced about it they could
[09:40] still get the one Bitcoin. That's what I
[09:42] was going to say. You could still do it.
[09:44] Is very rapidly closing. Oh yes. And
[09:47] it's gonna soon I mean the the
[09:50] institutions got the green light by the
[09:52] government. The current administration
[09:53] is very friendly of course towards
[09:55] Bitcoin. Um we see you know headlines
[09:59] all the time. We see the the news and we
[10:02] watch the all the Twitter channels where
[10:04] have their eyes 24/7 on news you know
[10:06] from any any source at all from Bitcoin
[10:09] news. So we're always getting that new
[10:11] news but we never see what's behind the
[10:14] scenes. you know what's going on behind
[10:15] the scenes. I mean, Fidelity is open
[10:19] about it. Uh, Black Rockck is they they
[10:21] manage $13 trillion in wealth, you know,
[10:25] asset under management for the whole
[10:27] world. 13 trillion is more than a lot of
[10:30] nations are worth, right? So, can you
[10:32] imagine um how the banks are developing
[10:37] infrastructure, digital infrastructure
[10:38] to start custoing in Bitcoin for people?
[10:40] Once they do that, it's game over.
[10:42] Absolutely. It's it's it's really
[10:44] interesting. But uh we we we got we
[10:47] started in hot uh maybe for the few
[10:50] people that that not know you that
[10:52] haven't seen the first episode with you
[10:54] because you're uh one of the few
[10:56] returning guests. Um maybe give people
[10:58] some some background of like who you are
[11:00] and why you're in general excited about
[11:02] Bitcoin. Yeah, absolutely. Yeah. So my
[11:05] my name is Gus Henry. It's I have it's
[11:08] my first and middle name. Um my mom
[11:11] brought me to America when I was 10
[11:12] years old and um I've never thought I'd
[11:16] be this wealthy, you know, uh and of
[11:19] course spiritually uh but also
[11:22] physically in the sense that only
[11:24] Bitcoin can can give this opportunity to
[11:26] people, you know. Um I came from my mom
[11:29] used to make $15,000 a year. Um we came
[11:32] from American standards poverty, you
[11:35] know, American standards. Of course,
[11:36] it's not poverty in America. people who
[11:38] say that they're poor in America. It's
[11:41] cute compared to some third world
[11:42] countries. You know, Europe and America
[11:44] were very fortunate to live here. But um
[11:46] basically grew up in uh worked with
[11:48] roofing. I've done restaurants. I uh
[11:51] dropped out of high school proudly so. I
[11:53] hated high school last time we talked
[11:55] about this. Um then I went to work for a
[11:58] roofing company and did part-time in a
[12:00] in a little market bodega store.
[12:04] And I met many people, talked to many
[12:06] people. I love people, you know. Uh I I
[12:08] love people so much that eventually I
[12:10] went to work for an ambulance service.
[12:12] Um and then during uh the pandem uh I
[12:17] don't want a nuclear channel. During the
[12:19] thing that happened in the major thing
[12:21] that happened in 2020 uh my friends came
[12:24] over with a huge grill. I mean they
[12:27] showed up my childhood friends. It was a
[12:29] surprise for me. I was really excited.
[12:31] Um I had bought my house. Uh at that
[12:34] time it had been two years I had bought
[12:36] my house. We did a beautiful barbecue
[12:38] here was a bunch of people and then we
[12:40] made a pact. We made a covenant. Um
[12:43] Diego uh who was always very being very
[12:45] responsible with his money. He he was
[12:47] working when he was like 14 ling about
[12:49] his age just to work to help his mom pay
[12:51] the bills. He's amazing. Diego
[12:52] Kawuchcci. He made us all download Robin
[12:55] Hood and we were all all into it because
[12:57] he's like let's retire early. Let's get
[12:59] you know let's make a million dollars.
[13:01] We're going to be millionaires. And then
[13:02] we all made a pack to invest $100 every
[13:05] week. Now, when I was scrolling through
[13:07] Robin Hood and find out what should, you
[13:09] know, what should I invest in, I came
[13:11] across this thing called Bitcoin and I
[13:13] noticed that it went from $20,000
[13:17] to $65,000
[13:19] in a period of a couple months. I'm
[13:21] like, what is this? And I remember from
[13:24] 2018 when I was in the pizzeria, I had
[13:26] heard about it in the TV and I shrugged
[13:28] it off. It was 2018, man, if I could
[13:31] have bought some Bitcoin there. But um
[13:33] ever since then I started studying
[13:35] Bitcoin. I joined Twitter X and Bitcoin
[13:39] Twitter X. Please guys make an account.
[13:41] Join and follow as join X and follow as
[13:45] many uh Bitcoin accounts as you can. The
[13:47] Bitcoin people are very very helpful.
[13:50] They help you with anything. Uh be
[13:52] careful of scammers of course just like
[13:54] anywhere. Even you know you get text
[13:56] messages scammers all the time. But um
[13:59] join Bitcoin Twitter and talk to the
[14:01] people. they'll they'll guide you
[14:02] through. But anyways, X um helped me get
[14:05] a node. I have a Bitcoin node. I run
[14:07] actually more than a couple of them. Um
[14:09] I have, you know, never never put your
[14:11] eggs in in one basket. I always have a
[14:14] few wallets that you spread with
[14:16] multi-IGs and you memorize it and you
[14:18] have it stamped in steel. But yeah, so
[14:20] that's that's a little bit of my
[14:22] background. I basically worked in the
[14:23] ambulance service for the past and
[14:25] cleaning house for the past um nine
[14:28] years. But the past five years, I've
[14:31] been stacking sats and I haven't looked
[14:34] back. I haven't stopped. I It's even
[14:36] more addicting. And and Bitcoin is the
[14:38] is the thing you fall in love with. You
[14:40] know, things fade away. Your your
[14:43] addiction or your love for things fade
[14:45] away with time. Bitcoin, the more you
[14:49] know Bitcoin, the more you fall in love
[14:51] with it, the deeper the rabbit hole
[14:53] gets. And people who there's no such
[14:55] thing as a Bitcoin expert. Even Andre
[14:57] Antonopoulos said this. and he's just
[14:59] the he's just a complete he know he's
[15:01] the expert, right? But even then he
[15:04] doesn't call himself himself an expert.
[15:06] So the more you know Bitcoin, you know,
[15:09] it's getting to the point now that I
[15:10] made a goal to to study C++ to get to
[15:13] know a little bit about coding and see
[15:14] how Bitcoin is made. But the more you
[15:16] get to know Bitcoin, the more of its
[15:18] beauties you you it improves your life.
[15:20] It completely changes your life. I mean,
[15:22] it's going to make Yes, it's going to
[15:24] make you physically wealthy. you know,
[15:25] according to world standards, you're
[15:27] going to be super wealthy. Your net
[15:28] worth is going to 10x, 20x, 25x, and
[15:32] yes, you're still early. Oh, but but
[15:34] Bitcoin is still 100, you know, it's
[15:36] it's 105,000. It's done. No, it's going
[15:38] to go to a million, and it's going to go
[15:40] to 10 million. Satoshi predicted this.
[15:43] It's it's absolute scarce. And the when
[15:46] people tell me they think that Bitcoin
[15:48] is related to Bitcoin, I just ask them,
[15:51] will the banksters will the government
[15:53] stop printing money?
[15:56] The answer is no. And there's only 21
[15:58] million Bitcoin forever. So that's what
[16:00] I tell people. You you you are early to
[16:02] Bitcoin. Even if it's five year, you're
[16:04] early to Bitcoin, isn't it? uh just
[16:07] today where Donald Trump uh said, "I
[16:11] agree with Elizabeth Warren that we have
[16:13] to raise the depth limit and and print a
[16:16] bunch of money." Isn't that the only
[16:17] thing that they agree on that they have
[16:19] to print more money? Dude, I couldn't
[16:21] believe my eyes last night when I got
[16:23] home from Costco. I was scrolling
[16:25] through and um Eden Seeka, you had him
[16:28] on because I I told Seeka that you're
[16:30] really cool at podcast and he came on.
[16:33] Um I was like, "Adam, is this real?" I
[16:36] thought it was fake. I thought it was AI
[16:39] generated. You know, people love pol
[16:42] people love, you know, the clickbaity
[16:43] stuff. No, it's real. So, so both the
[16:47] extreme right and the extreme left in
[16:48] America agree that we should print money
[16:51] forever. It's the one thing that is that
[16:55] is probably more true than the sun going
[16:57] up and and and you're breathing in and
[16:59] in and natural laws. It's like they will
[17:02] print more money and that's why Bitcoin
[17:04] will always go up in US dollar terms.
[17:07] It's it's so funny for me when I say
[17:09] like oh like 0.1 Bitcoin will be a lot
[17:11] of money one day. I never put a timeline
[17:14] on there. I never say like oh at 2035 or
[17:17] anything like that because it will be
[17:19] true. 0.1 Bitcoin will be so freaking
[17:21] much. Maybe in 10 years, maybe in a 100
[17:23] years, maybe in 200 years. I don't know
[17:25] the timeline. It's impossible to
[17:27] predict. But if they keep printing money
[17:29] and Bitcoin is a standard and there's
[17:31] just 21 million uh Bitcoin, one tenth of
[17:36] a Bitcoin will be so freaking much that
[17:38] you won't even believe it. Maybe uh at
[17:41] the point where I'm already dead. Like
[17:43] okay, maybe it takes longer than I think
[17:45] that like that can be happening. I think
[17:47] it will be a lot faster than most people
[17:49] think. Um but I don't want to do
[17:52] predictions on like timelines because I
[17:54] think it's just impossible to know. But
[17:56] I would I would encourage everyone to uh
[18:00] be very like look at about look at your
[18:05] current Bitcoin fuel and 10x the
[18:08] bullishness of yourself because then
[18:10] maybe you at a good enough level I had
[18:13] CK on recently and he's he is really
[18:16] famous for saying like nobody's bullish
[18:18] enough on Bitcoin. He's like, "Why am I
[18:21] the guys saying that?" Because it's like
[18:23] such an easy thing to say. Nobody's
[18:25] version of Bitcoin. Like, we never had
[18:27] the opportunity of what Bitcoin really
[18:29] is. Yeah. This is why I'm so excited
[18:31] about podcasts like yours, man. I really
[18:33] appreciate it. When you reached out to
[18:35] me a year ago, over a year ago, to to be
[18:37] in your podcast, I'm like, "Oh, this
[18:39] ought to be fun." You know, I I you
[18:42] know, every time I do this podcast with
[18:43] you, it's so much fun to ponder over
[18:45] these things cuz most of us in our
[18:48] everyday lives, we don't know other
[18:49] Bitcoiners, you know, and people don't
[18:51] usually talk about a lot of Bitcoiners
[18:53] are actually quiet about it because
[18:54] they're afraid of getting, you know, the
[18:56] $5 range attack, which is totally
[18:58] understandable, especially in Europe
[18:59] where you can't own guns. But um I was
[19:02] very excited about your podcast and I'm
[19:05] still am very bullish in podcasts like
[19:07] yours because eventually
[19:10] the masses are going to flock to your
[19:12] channel. It's happening. Simply Bitcoin
[19:15] is seeing it. Um Bitcoin for
[19:17] millennials. I went to his podcast.
[19:18] Really cool dude. Braum. I loved the
[19:20] podcast you guys did together. I really
[19:22] enjoyed it. You and Braum, what a
[19:24] dynamic duo. You guys should have a show
[19:26] together. But, um, it's people are going
[19:29] to flock into your channels and they're
[19:32] going to consume, they're going to get
[19:33] addicted to your content, especially
[19:36] you. You interview like average everyday
[19:38] people. And I hope we can make this a
[19:41] thing. Like every year, if you could
[19:42] have me back, I'd love that, you know,
[19:44] just to get updates and stuff. But you
[19:46] have people from all walks of life. Just
[19:48] like that's how Joe Rogan made it to to
[19:51] be 15 million downloads every episode.
[19:53] He just he interviewed his friends. He
[19:56] interviewed people he knew. He
[19:58] interviewed people who, you know, who
[20:00] were experts in certain c certain
[20:02] niches, you know, and this is why the
[20:05] masses will flock to your channel. It's
[20:07] happening now once I think, you know, I
[20:09] used to think that and in a way Bitcoin
[20:12] did have the grassroots from bottom to
[20:14] the top, you know, now now I I feel like
[20:17] it's it's meeting halfway. So the
[20:20] adoption started in 20
[20:23] 2010
[20:25] 2011 uh 2012 it started from the bottom
[20:28] up but now I feel like the Bitcoin
[20:30] adoption is coming from the institutions
[20:34] right it it seems like to it it's
[20:36] stalled here with with retail and
[20:38] everyday people and now it seems that
[20:40] like you know Black Rockck Fidelity
[20:43] Croup it's coming all from the top and
[20:46] then the Trumps are now apparently by
[20:49] the way Trump won't shut up about
[20:51] Bitcoin. So, Trump is like a his son has
[20:54] said it multiple times. My dad's a
[20:56] Bitcoin max. He, you know, how true is
[20:58] that? I don't know, but I believe it.
[21:01] Um, he won't shut up about Bitcoin. And
[21:04] he is telling all his billionaire
[21:06] friends about it. Everybody knows Trump.
[21:08] Trump is, you know, very he he's a
[21:10] socialite. He knows a lot of people. Um,
[21:12] not to mention Scaramucci and the people
[21:15] from the Shark Tank, most of them love
[21:17] Bitcoin. So it's spreading throughout
[21:19] the culture. So eventually all the
[21:21] masses are going to come to Bitcoin
[21:23] education. They'll need it. You know,
[21:25] it's very very tough when I first found
[21:27] Bitcoin. You know, it's that's why I
[21:28] tell people join Bitcoin X because
[21:30] people will help you. Wicked smart
[21:33] Bitcoin. uh there's so many channels
[21:35] that you can get a lot of information
[21:36] from and um and people who who say you
[21:40] know the main the main message that I
[21:42] would have you know if you're watching
[21:43] this in a year from now two years from
[21:45] now the main message that I have is
[21:48] Bitcoin only because
[21:50] Bitcoin had the immaculate conception
[21:53] Bitcoin um nobody knows who Satoshi is.
[21:57] He never moved his coins. Um it was um
[22:01] there was no ICO initial initial coin
[22:04] offering or initial public offering.
[22:06] There was no uh uh early investors like
[22:10] Ethereum. Ethereum had a group a small
[22:12] group of people who keeps dumping on
[22:14] retail and they'll do it forever because
[22:16] they you know they're multi-billionaires
[22:18] because they gave themselves the coins
[22:20] and then that's the premine. You know
[22:21] they don't even do the work for it. No.
[22:24] Satoshi Nakamoto
[22:26] worked for his million coins and he's
[22:29] never moved them. So we e we think he's
[22:31] either
[22:33] dead or he lost his keys or you know
[22:39] people have different theories about it
[22:41] but his coins have never moved at this
[22:42] point it's never going to move. What
[22:44] human can control himself like this? He
[22:46] probably lost his keys or they and um
[22:50] Bitcoin only because it is the um
[22:53] immaculately conceived scarce asset. Um
[22:57] some people make some arguments for
[22:59] privacy coins. I'm not pro that. But
[23:02] just stick to Bitcoin. It's the only
[23:04] thing that you will ever need. It's the
[23:05] only had a fair launch. He didn't even
[23:08] have a launch. But uh Bitcoin is the
[23:10] only way to get um to get out of from
[23:14] the banksters
[23:15] thumb
[23:17] 100%. And it spreads like wildfire and I
[23:20] I think was it you I think you brought
[23:24] this Bitcoin is fire uh comparison in
[23:27] last time. May maybe I'm I'm wrong if if
[23:29] I remember correctly. I think uh you you
[23:32] mentioned how Bitcoin is fire and how
[23:35] Bitcoin is uh such an in invent in
[23:37] invention like fire. Can you remember if
[23:40] that was you maybe? Yes. Um yeah, I
[23:42] mentioned a lot. Uh so Bitcoin is akin
[23:45] to fire, you know, the wheel. And that's
[23:47] what I said last time. I think that's
[23:49] what you're remembering. You know,
[23:50] Bitcoin is akin to to the internet, to
[23:53] flight. You know, Bitcoin is um it's
[23:57] it's a discovery. I don't think it's an
[23:59] invention because Bitcoin has always
[24:01] existed. It's digital scarcity. You
[24:04] know, matter can neither neither be
[24:06] created nor destroyed. You know, matter
[24:08] is energy. Energy is matter. E= MC².
[24:11] It's it's obvious. It's a law of physics
[24:13] and the and the laws and the laws of
[24:15] thermodynamics dictate. Um and Bitcoin
[24:18] is just the discovery of digital
[24:20] scarcity. So, it is a ledger, an
[24:24] immutable ledger in cyerspace. It is
[24:26] trustless, permissionless. Um it can be
[24:31] um
[24:32] it can be used by anyone anywhere. Can
[24:36] be sent across this across the earth at
[24:38] the speed of light through layer twos.
[24:42] Um and it it is immutable. It is
[24:45] uninflatable. The banksters can't
[24:47] inflate it. The politicians cannot
[24:49] manipulate it. Right? We have this
[24:51] trouble in society where politicians are
[24:53] all corrupt. Right? Doesn't matter if
[24:55] you're Nigeria. Doesn't matter if you're
[24:57] in Russia. Doesn't matter if you're in
[24:58] China. Doesn't matter if you're United
[24:59] States. Doesn't matter if you're Brazil.
[25:01] You can mention all 200 countries.
[25:04] Doesn't matter where you are.
[25:05] Politicians are snakes. They're liars.
[25:07] They'll work for the people who pay them
[25:09] the most. Bitcoin is incorruptible and
[25:12] unmanipulable by them. So, it doesn't
[25:15] matter. They can't promise. All right,
[25:17] Black Rockck, if you if you give me a
[25:19] billion dollars, that's what they they
[25:21] have backdoor deals all the time.
[25:22] people, you know, play PLABS don't know,
[25:25] most people don't know, but Elizabeth
[25:27] Warren is taking money from the banks.
[25:29] Uh Trump is taking money from giant
[25:31] pharmaceutical companies. You know, he's
[25:33] never going to be um anti-establishment
[25:37] in a way. People think that's he's like
[25:38] a he is a bull in a china shop in the
[25:41] sense that he is destroying modern-day
[25:43] politics, you know, the the the status
[25:45] quo, but he's still the he's still the
[25:48] the very much uh the the establishment
[25:51] itself. But the point is that nobody can
[25:54] manipulate Bitcoin. Bitcoin is
[25:56] unmanipulable. You politicians can't
[25:59] stop it. They can't alter it. They can't
[26:01] inflate it. They can't manipulate it.
[26:04] And that's the beauty of Bitcoin is that
[26:06] when you buy when you take a piece of
[26:08] that Bitcoin, only 21 million forever.
[26:11] You take a piece of that Bitcoin, it's
[26:12] yours to keep. And try getting gold
[26:16] across borders, right? Oh, I don't need
[26:19] to go across borders. I don't Well,
[26:21] you're not in Ukraine. You're not in
[26:22] Russia. You're not in China. You're not
[26:24] in North Korea, right? You're not
[26:27] oppressed, you know, in a western
[26:29] countries. We have such good lives, man.
[26:31] I always remind people. I always remind
[26:33] friends and family. We have such we're
[26:35] so privileged and I hate to use that
[26:36] word. We are so privileged. I have
[26:39] family, you know, from all colors of
[26:41] religions and background. I have family
[26:43] from, you know, my my both sides of my
[26:45] family. From my mother's side, they all
[26:47] mostly married other Italian people.
[26:50] From my father's side, um they
[26:53] intermixed with, you know, Native
[26:56] American Indians. They intermix with
[26:57] with black people. They intermix. And
[26:59] it's such a beautiful family. They have
[27:01] cousins from all colors and backgrounds.
[27:04] And I'm telling you,
[27:06] third world countries are a terror, a
[27:11] horror. If you think your politicians
[27:13] are corrupt, third world country
[27:15] politicians, they are the worst. And
[27:18] they take all of their constituents
[27:21] money, all the voters money. They have
[27:24] backdoor deals where they pretty much
[27:26] sell the country to enrich their their
[27:28] pockets. So, Bitcoin is a way for the
[27:31] for the plebeian, for the working class
[27:33] to say enough. This is my money. You
[27:36] cannot take this away from me. And even
[27:38] if they try, they cannot take it away
[27:39] from me because you just got to memorize
[27:41] 12 to 24 words and that's it. You're
[27:44] free to go anywhere you want and you're
[27:46] free to move to a jurisdiction that's
[27:48] going to be friendly towards you. Right?
[27:50] If you're being oppressed in North
[27:51] Korea, well, take your stuff and go. You
[27:54] know, if you if you're living in Ukraine
[27:55] and there's war, take your stuff and go.
[27:58] If you're living in Russia and you're a
[28:00] homosexual, for example, you know, take
[28:03] your stuff and go. You know, if you're
[28:05] if you're a Jew, Nazi Germany, take your
[28:07] stuff and go. That's Bitcoin. That's the
[28:10] power that Bitcoin gives you. And it's
[28:13] when people realize this, they're going
[28:15] to flock to Bitcoiners channels. They're
[28:17] because they will need the the education
[28:18] that you provide. The first time I ever
[28:20] made any money, I got myself from that
[28:23] money a watch. And ever since then, I
[28:25] collect time pieces to remember times
[28:28] where I achieved some milestone. That's
[28:30] why I got the Bitcoin 2025 edition when
[28:34] I went to my first ever American Bitcoin
[28:36] conference. So for me, the Bitcoin
[28:38] watches from Coin Villain represents the
[28:41] time that we are living in. For every
[28:43] person that wears a Bitcoin watch, I
[28:46] know they are representing sound money
[28:50] to the outside world. Make sure to check
[28:52] out those amazing coin vigilante time
[28:55] pieces down in the descriptions. I love
[28:57] those watches so so much. I know how big
[29:01] of a hurdle it can be to have
[29:03] self-custody, but it's so freaking
[29:05] important to make that first step. We
[29:08] have to make sure it's as easy and
[29:11] simple as possible. And that's exactly
[29:14] what Bitbox did. Bitbox created the
[29:17] simplest and the easiest hardware wallet
[29:19] to use to get into self custody. So get
[29:23] yourself a Bitbox down from the link in
[29:25] the description. And when you use code
[29:27] Robin, you even get a 5% discount. Most
[29:31] people realize that way, way, way too
[29:34] late. If you have Bitcoin, you have to
[29:37] have a self-custody hardware wallet. But
[29:39] what are you doing if that hardware
[29:40] wallet breaks? Yeah, you wrote your seed
[29:43] phrase on paper and what if that paper
[29:46] is just dissolving or water is spilled
[29:49] on top of it? Paper is very very
[29:51] nondurable. So you have to have a fire
[29:54] resistant, water resistant and impact
[29:57] proof method of securing your seat
[30:00] phrase so you can back up your keys. And
[30:03] to do that, you should use a solid
[30:05] titanium plate from Stamp Seed. Go to
[30:08] stampseed.com
[30:10] and use code Robin to get not five or 10
[30:14] but 15% off your stamp seed. The most
[30:19] important thing for your Bitcoin journey
[30:21] is not buying Bitcoin, but it's how to
[30:24] keep them. And yes, you have maybe the
[30:26] right tools, but how do you actually go
[30:28] ahead and stick it all together so it's
[30:31] the most secure for you personally?
[30:34] Self-custody is a deeply personalized
[30:36] journey and the Bitcoin way is helping
[30:38] you exactly finding that correct setup
[30:42] for you personally. They're also helping
[30:44] you with securing your own cyber
[30:47] security. And if you want to go one step
[30:50] above all that, you can even get a
[30:52] consultation for a plan B residency. Go
[30:56] to the bitcoinway.com/roin
[31:00] and you will get a 30inut free
[31:03] consultation. Do do you think
[31:06] do do you think we are now officially
[31:08] kind of in this d then they join you
[31:10] phase where governments are now I mean
[31:12] we have the president talking about
[31:14] bitcoin conferences. We have the vice
[31:16] president going to bitcoin conferences.
[31:18] Uh is is this a slow move from like
[31:20] tyranny to like sovereignty in a in a in
[31:23] a state where they they kind of see it's
[31:26] they they cannot fight it so like you
[31:29] might as well just join it. Yeah, I can
[31:32] picture it too. Um it's the opposite of
[31:36] it's the opposite of a a centralized
[31:39] system. It's Bitcoin is is like a a
[31:43] magnet that's that's spreading spreading
[31:47] the centralization into a decentralized
[31:49] world and things are getting more
[31:51] equitable and the the equality of
[31:54] opportunity will be there for everybody.
[31:56] Um true meritocracy will exist. Um it's
[32:01] Bitcoin is is causing such a wide a wide
[32:07] change and improvement to the world that
[32:10] historians and um people who study
[32:13] sociology, anthropology, archaeology, um
[32:17] technological innovations, people who
[32:19] who are academics who spend their lives
[32:22] studying humanity and studying the
[32:25] progression of history, um they're going
[32:27] to be baffled. their minds are going to
[32:30] be blown by, you know,
[32:34] when there is a large group of people
[32:36] and we we I think Bitcoiners now we are
[32:38] a large group of people. We are a huge
[32:41] community, right? It started with 12
[32:43] people in a in a cipher punk um group
[32:46] chat, right, in a forum and um it then
[32:50] went to dozens of people and then
[32:53] eventually to hundreds of people and of
[32:56] course it it seems trivial but it spread
[33:01] so quickly.
[33:03] It spread so much through the entirety
[33:06] of the world. Bitcoin is in every nation
[33:09] state. I mean inside every jurisdiction
[33:11] of every nation state in the world.
[33:13] Every language group has seen or touched
[33:15] or heard of Bitcoin. So people need to
[33:18] think, huh, is there something there
[33:20] that I'm missing? You know, people who
[33:22] like me when I went in 2018, I was in a
[33:24] pizzeria and I was about to close the
[33:27] pizzeria with my boss. Him and I were
[33:29] looking at the TV. Bitcoin blah blah
[33:31] blah. I don't even remember what they
[33:32] were saying. I just remember Bitcoin and
[33:34] you know that they were just talking
[33:36] about Bitcoin and it was time for me to
[33:38] close the the restaurant though. So I
[33:40] went like whatever. I turned around and
[33:43] left. Had I been like wait a minute
[33:46] maybe maybe they have a point. What is
[33:48] this Bitcoin thing? I should look into
[33:50] it. If I Googled that, I could have got
[33:53] money from the money spigot in the
[33:55] remember the money spigot back in the
[33:56] days that would you just would visit the
[33:58] site for people who don't know and the
[34:00] and the money spigot would give you a
[34:02] couple bitcoins like one or two bitcoins
[34:04] depending you know um so
[34:09] people and I think households I mean if
[34:11] you look at Nigeria the adoption there
[34:14] is fire the it's up to out of 10 people
[34:17] in Nigeria six own Bitcoin and of of
[34:20] course It's mostly mostly the youth.
[34:22] It's most mostly younger people, right?
[34:25] Um but also the the people who are
[34:28] millennials and Gen Xers and Jenzers,
[34:30] they are coming to the conclusion of the
[34:34] truth because it's true that
[34:36] government's corrupt. Government sucks
[34:38] at everything. Uh government is going to
[34:41] continue to steal from you. Well, how do
[34:43] they steal from us? Well, not only by
[34:45] briberies and political backdoor deals
[34:48] by selling your natural resources, but
[34:50] they also steal through inflation. They
[34:52] print money that you have to work for
[34:56] that I have to work for. Well, I don't
[34:57] work for that money anymore. I
[34:59] immediately change my my fiat into
[35:01] Satoshi, so I work for Bitcoin. Um, they
[35:04] print the money that you have to use.
[35:07] And that's what Nigerians are coming to
[35:09] to the conclusion of. They're like,
[35:11] "Wait, wait a minute. you just printing
[35:13] this money, you know, no, I don't want
[35:16] it. And so they go and they buy they buy
[35:19] Bitcoin. And the government initiator
[35:21] was like, "No, bend Bitcoin." And then
[35:23] they saw how how stupid that that term
[35:25] is, Ben Bitcoin. It's impossible. You
[35:27] can shut off the on and off ramps. But
[35:29] there is this guy um one of many, but
[35:32] there's this guy called Ray No. No one's
[35:35] he made this he made this application in
[35:38] Africa. It's called No One's app. no one
[35:42] no one's app and people will exchange
[35:45] goods and services and buy Bitcoin
[35:48] through a peer-to-peer decentralized
[35:50] way. So even if even if every African
[35:54] government ban Bitcoin which is
[35:56] impossible right they they they shut the
[35:58] on and off ramps Ry Civit Ray Ray from
[36:02] the ones will get Bitcoin into your
[36:06] hands because it's it's it's just it's
[36:08] speech it's unbenable. The founding
[36:11] fathers in America knew that they
[36:13] couldn't bend speech, so they weren't
[36:15] even going to try. It's unbenable,
[36:16] right? Um,
[36:19] that's what Bitcoin is. It's speech.
[36:21] It's it's code. It's written speech that
[36:24] people are going to get a hold of. And
[36:26] when you see it, you can't unsee it.
[36:28] That Bitcoin is the discovered digital
[36:30] scarcity. And it's giving the power back
[36:33] to the people from the tyrants. It's
[36:35] over. The time's over for the tyrants.
[36:37] Thank God.
[36:39] There's one concern of mine. Uh it's not
[36:42] a big concern, but it's something that
[36:44] that I notice. We have currently a shift
[36:47] in a lot of institutional adoption and
[36:50] retail is kind of sleeping. Um we have
[36:53] more more of this talk of like, hey,
[36:55] don't sell your Bitcoin, but borrow
[36:56] against it. You just give your Bitcoin
[36:59] to institutions and you get some fiat
[37:01] money for that. uh and you end up with
[37:04] an IOU again and the Bitcoin is against
[37:07] its institutional at some institutional
[37:10] vault. Um is there is there something
[37:14] where you think like we we growing like
[37:17] there's always like we are growing we're
[37:19] getting more mature obviously
[37:20] institutions coming in obviously
[37:22] financial products will be built around
[37:23] Bitcoin but is there any concern that
[37:26] this growing and maturing might end up
[37:28] that we kind of lose that freedom and
[37:31] sovereignty and the original kind of
[37:34] cipher punk Bitcoin eos in there. Yeah,
[37:38] I think it's bound to happen. You know,
[37:40] is um for example, Sailor talked about
[37:42] this in details, you know, um grandpa,
[37:46] for example, he is 78 years old. I'm
[37:49] just making up a generic grandpa for
[37:51] people. Um he's 78 years old.
[37:55] He's not going to learn how to use
[37:57] Sparrow, right? He's just going to go
[37:58] like this. Hello, Fidelity. Can you
[38:01] please buy uh $50,000 of Bitcoin for me?
[38:04] And then thus a bit paper Bitcoin is
[38:08] born which is that you know that's I was
[38:11] actually thinking this two days ago in
[38:13] the ambulance service when I had some
[38:15] downtime I was walking around the the
[38:19] station there and I I was thinking man
[38:21] how much paper Bitcoin is there you know
[38:25] and it's kind of scary to think I see
[38:27] what you're saying you know it is kind
[38:29] of um scary to think but eventually Um,
[38:35] just like the thing that happened to
[38:36] FTX, you know, they had a ton of paper
[38:38] Bitcoin and then when they were caught
[38:41] red-handed, uh, the market dumped to to
[38:44] $16,000.
[38:46] And what people don't understand about
[38:48] that is that Bitcoiners are happy when
[38:49] it dumps that much. You know, is it
[38:52] going to dump soon? because, you know,
[38:54] we're going to have like a sailor
[38:56] um what you call it a sailor um
[39:01] you know, are we going to find out that
[39:02] he has a ton of paper Bitcoin because he
[39:04] didn't want to do approve of reserves?
[39:06] Um I don't think so. I don't think it's
[39:08] going to happen. I mean, it is possible.
[39:11] Even if it does happen and there's a I
[39:13] was looking for the word scandal. Even
[39:14] if there's a major scandal and we find
[39:17] out find out half of Micro Strategies
[39:19] Bitcoin or paper Bitcoin, yeah, the
[39:21] price will dump, you know, 50K, 58K, and
[39:25] then it's just going to go up because
[39:26] the the the value the the let's use the
[39:29] word intrinsic. The intrinsic value of
[39:32] Bitcoin is
[39:34] absolute. It is objective. It is
[39:38] embedded in the the laws of physics and
[39:41] thermodynamics. digital scarcity. It it
[39:43] will it go down eventually? Yes, it will
[39:45] a little bit even if there's a paper
[39:47] Bitcoin scandal, but it's going to rage
[39:50] pump with the revenge. I do you remember
[39:52] man when 2022 when we were like around
[39:57] um you know it was like 15k the lowest
[39:59] was 165 500 and then we got to 25 and
[40:03] then everyone was like oh man I'm going
[40:05] to wait to buy you know people like
[40:06] Gareth Soloway we'll just we'll buy when
[40:09] it's 8,000 and then it rage pumped to
[40:12] like 34,000
[40:14] and then everyone's like all right guys
[40:15] this is it and the next two three year
[40:18] or we are about 3 years after that. But
[40:22] and in two years, we we saw Bitcoin
[40:24] going to all-time highs, $80,000, right?
[40:27] It was so fun. And in a way, I was sad
[40:31] because you I'm never going to be able
[40:33] to buy Bitcoin for $50,000 again. So, I
[40:36] cherish every moment of when I DCA for,
[40:39] you know, low low amounts like that. So,
[40:41] in a way, will we ever have a a paper
[40:44] Bitcoin scandal? I hope so, because then
[40:47] I can buy more cheap sats.
[40:50] Yeah, this year we can see it. It's it
[40:53] was around the uh November December 2022
[40:57] era where we had the 16,000. And man, we
[41:00] were ready. I I I was ready to go down
[41:02] to 5,000. I was like, let let's do this
[41:04]  Like, let's let's get get some
[41:06] Bitcoin under 10K. But unfortunately, it
[41:09] it never happened. Amazing, man. Can you
[41:11] believe? Look at that. And I I honestly
[41:14] think, if you ask me, I honestly think
[41:17] we're never going back. We're never
[41:19] going to see $70,000 again. And people
[41:22] are saying, "Oh, you know, you're gonna
[41:23] jinx us. You're g I hope so. I want
[41:25] lower. I want to buy cheaper Satoshi's,
[41:28] you know." So, I hope I don't think
[41:29] we're ever going to see You see how
[41:31] Bitcoin is holding now above 100,000,
[41:34] right? It's holding steadily because
[41:36] Fidelity, Cityroup, they're all buying
[41:39] it. You know, JP Morgan, Chase, they're
[41:41] now custodying Bitcoin. You know, Jamie
[41:43] Diamond said, "I hate bitcoins. Those
[41:45] steam bitcoins." Jamie Diamond always
[41:48] talks about Bitcoin is a is a digital
[41:50] money laundering scheme. Whatever,
[41:53] Grandpa, just go eat your tapioca and
[41:55] take a nap. And what is he said now a
[41:59] couple weeks ago? He said, "We're now
[42:01] custodying Bitcoin for our clients." Why
[42:04] is he doing that? He's not doing that
[42:06] out of the goodness of his heart. He
[42:08] hates Bitcoin. It's because billionaires
[42:10] were getting on the phone and saying,
[42:12] "Jamie, I've been your client for 20
[42:14] years. I'm going to leave you if you
[42:16] don't let me custody Bitcoin. So he's
[42:18] like, "Yes, sir. Yes, sir. Yes, sir."
[42:19] And now he's talking about because he's,
[42:21] you know, people are obviously catching
[42:23] him on his lies. He is custodying
[42:26] Bitcoin for his clients. So, it's
[42:29] coming. It's here. It's already here.
[42:31] Institutions are not coming. They're
[42:33] here. And it's going to spread faster
[42:35] and faster. Um, if I hope, you know, I
[42:39] love America. I'm an American. Like I
[42:41] I've told you before, I've been here
[42:42] since I was 10 years old. I really hope,
[42:45] wish, and pray that Trump and and uh the
[42:49] Wyoming Republican Senator Cynthia
[42:52] Lumis, she's a ve she's a huge
[42:54] Bitcoiner. We love her in Bitcoin. Uh
[42:57] thank you, Cynthia Lumis. If you ever
[42:59] watch this by chance, we love you very
[43:01] much. Um she has a bill that will make
[43:06] the United States Treasury buy and
[43:09] huddle 1 million bitcoins. If that
[43:14] passes
[43:16] the there is going to be
[43:19] such a huge supply shock because when
[43:22] people see we say we say you know in the
[43:25] economics world we say when America um
[43:30] sneezes the world catches a cold because
[43:32] everybody looks to America like it or
[43:35] not for better for worse everybody is
[43:37] looking to America because of our stable
[43:39] government and Europe in a way too. So
[43:42] if when America does something in Europe
[43:44] it does something everybody follows
[43:46] suits. All the third world countries
[43:48] like Brazil you know and these are not
[43:50] small countries I'm talking about
[43:51] countries with 210 million 250 million
[43:54] Indonesia you know we're talking about
[43:57] um India for example you know Pakistan I
[44:01] think Pakistan has you know a good 100
[44:04] over 100 million Nigeria now that the
[44:06] population their growth is booming. Um,
[44:09] so eventually when America starts
[44:10] huddling Bitcoin, all the other
[44:12] governments are going to do it and Trump
[44:14] already gave everybody the green light.
[44:15] So I think Robin it's happening as we
[44:18] speak. It's fair to it's it's it's
[44:20] already there. I just want to um mention
[44:23] that because you brought it up with
[44:25] paper Bitcoin and strategy. I I really
[44:28] like I have very high doubt that he is
[44:30] doing that because um like FDX was an
[44:34] offshore
[44:36] thing like it was not like an SEC
[44:38] approved thing or something like that
[44:40] and I do believe that like like look at
[44:43] the incentive that Sailor has to do real
[44:46] paper Bitcoin. Yeah, of course like you
[44:48] can make an argument it's paper Bitcoin
[44:49] because like it lays with Coinbase and
[44:51] with like other custodians. He does not
[44:54] own the keys. like he was not running
[44:55] around with like keys for 500,000
[44:57] bitcoin. Yeah. Uh if if you count that
[44:59] as paper bitcoin. Yeah. He most of the
[45:01] institutions have paper bitcoin. But um
[45:05] he actually bought them and uh if he
[45:09] would lie about that he could face
[45:12] prison. Yeah. For what upside?
[45:16] What what would he gain from that? It's
[45:19] hilarious when people bring it up. So
[45:21] like Yeah. It's weird that he doesn't do
[45:23] the proof of reserve. Uh but there's
[45:25] probably a lot of reasons that are not
[45:28] public for exactly that and we we
[45:31] probably never really really know. But
[45:33] yeah, the security risks uh um might be
[45:37] legit. Like I'm I'm not clever enough to
[45:40] judge that actually. Like I I've never
[45:41] run a public traded company and I think
[45:43] nobody should judge that if they haven't
[45:46] run a publicly traded company.
[45:49] and think, "Oh, it's it's easy to to
[45:52] judge someone if you haven't walked in
[45:54] in his shoes." Um, but I want to
[45:56] highlight something that you've
[45:59] you've said and I think it's really
[46:01] interesting. You've said you you heard
[46:03] Bitcoin and you have not really paid
[46:05] attention and you don't even know what
[46:07] they uh said. And it's interesting
[46:09] because I think every Bitcoin mention is
[46:13] good for Bitcoin. Like probably most
[46:15] likely they said weird things about
[46:18] Bitcoin in in the TV. Like it probably
[46:20] wasn't like a Bitcoin podcast where like
[46:22] they had like a positive things about
[46:24] Bitcoin like oh like the price crashed
[46:26] or the price goes up like whatever. Um
[46:29] so every mention even if it's in the
[46:32] worst possible form even if even if uh
[46:35] Jamie Diamond is saying like oh like
[46:38] Bitcoin is bad or like Warren Buffett is
[46:40] like Bitcoin is rat poison. uh or all of
[46:43] those things, those are points for
[46:47] people to remember and the only real
[46:50] thing they remember is like Bitcoin and
[46:53] at some point they have a good
[46:54] connection with Bitcoin as you had later
[46:56] on and they're like, "Oh, I remember
[46:58] Bitcoin. I heard it like a year ago from
[47:00] Warren Buffett at two years ago from
[47:02] Jamie Diamond and three years ago from a
[47:04] random channel." I have no clue what
[47:06] they actually really said about Bitcoin,
[47:08] but I remember that name. And that's the
[47:11] big play that that's that's the thing
[47:13] that Bitcoin haters don't get. Um,
[47:17] and I told that story I think like at
[47:19] least like five times already in the
[47:20] podcast, but uh I was in university for
[47:25] like a very short amount of time. H and
[47:28] one of the classes was an IT security
[47:30] introductionary class. had nothing to do
[47:33] with Bitcoin, but the first class he did
[47:37] was uh on anti security and uh and
[47:41] encryption.
[47:43] So, he could mention Bitcoin
[47:46] uh but he doesn't have to mention
[47:48] Bitcoin. And he not only mentioned
[47:50] Bitcoin, he actually dumped on Bitcoin a
[47:54] lot. He's like, "Oh, it's too
[47:55] centralized. Like the miners all in in
[47:57] in China." And like he he mentioned some
[48:00] weird arguments like that which at the
[48:03] time was actually still true but like no
[48:05] longer there uh now. But the interesting
[48:08] thing is like he could choose to not
[48:10] mention it at all but he chose to
[48:13] introduce Bitcoin to every student in
[48:15] that university in a bad way. Yeah,
[48:17] granted but if you introduce it to like
[48:20] a thousand people there's at least like
[48:22] five people that like oh like let me
[48:24] Google that Bitcoin. Like why is he
[48:27] mentioning it? like why are we hearing
[48:29] about a cryptocurrency in an encryption
[48:32] course? Uh that that that is that is a
[48:35] little bit weird. I just want to hear
[48:37] about IT security. I don't want to I'm
[48:40] not in the finance class here. So um
[48:44] every mention of Bitcoin, every
[48:45] advertisement for Bitcoin, be it good or
[48:48] bad, I think it's very good for for
[48:50] Bitcoin and overall will increase uh
[48:54] adoption because there's already so much
[48:55] good material online there available.
[48:59] Yeah. Every I think it goes back to the
[49:01] thing every publicity is good publicity.
[49:04] You know, even if it's bad publicity in
[49:06] a way, you know, even if it's somebody
[49:08] like like your university professor
[49:10] trashing Bitcoin, you know, it's it's
[49:13] good because like you said, out of a
[49:14] thousand people, even if 15 people look
[49:18] it up, five of those thousand people are
[49:20] going to say, "Wait a minute, there's
[49:22] something to this." And they start
[49:23] studying it more and more, you know, and
[49:25] then again, they'll hear it mentioned
[49:26] over there and they'll hear it mentioned
[49:28] over there. I like I always like to
[49:30] bring up the example of Venmo. So Venmo
[49:33] is a um is an and it ties back to this.
[49:37] It's an application where you can just
[49:40] send your friends
[49:43] money. It's pretty much it. You can pay
[49:46] your guy, you can pay your your mom, you
[49:49] can exchange goods and Venmo is just
[49:52] it's a way for you to pay people without
[49:54] using cash. And everybody in America, if
[49:57] you're in America, you know, VMO, Zel,
[49:59] PayPal, it's the same thing kind of. And
[50:02] I remember one day being in the in the
[50:04] ambulance station and one of our
[50:07] co-workers say, "Hey guys, we're getting
[50:09] pizza." I'm like, "Okay, I want to pay
[50:11] Chin. I don't have any cash though. Can
[50:13] I get you later? You know, I'll go to
[50:15] the ATM and print it, whatever. You
[50:18] know, bring it and give it to you." And
[50:21] he said, "Oh, just use Venmo." And I'm
[50:24] like, what? You know, what is that? I
[50:27] never heard about Venmo before in my
[50:30] life. And apparently
[50:32] everybody had Venmo. My mom had Venmo.
[50:36] Come to find out, my cousins have Venmo.
[50:38] How did I not How did I not Maybe I
[50:41] heard about it and didn't pay attention.
[50:43] But how did I not know what Venmo was,
[50:46] you know? Of course, I immediately
[50:47] downloaded it because everybody's using
[50:49] it. It's much easier now. Makes life
[50:51] more simpler, you know. My pest control
[50:54] guy comes in. I'm like, "Oh, can I just
[50:56] VMO you? I don't have any cash, you
[50:58] know, uh, you know, your friend does
[51:01] Narin for you and you want to give him
[51:03] some gas money, you know, just Venmo
[51:05] him." You know, it's so much easier.
[51:07] It's obvious. It's the obvious next step
[51:09] for for human society. When people see
[51:13] when when people who study this subject
[51:16] see that there's a small group of people
[51:21] printing literally printing the money
[51:24] and even worse sometimes they don't even
[51:26] print because there's no proof of work
[51:28] not printing they just they just type
[51:32] they just type numbers on a screen
[51:36] Federal Reserve balance sheet the United
[51:38] States has another trillion dollars in
[51:42] circulation. When people realize that
[51:44] there is a small group of people
[51:46] printing the money that you and I have
[51:48] to work for,
[51:50] people are going to flock. Again, it
[51:52] always comes back to Bitcoin. People are
[51:53] going to flock to Bitcoin because
[51:55] they're going to look for for hard
[51:57] money. They're going to look for an
[51:58] asset that cannot be printed,
[52:01] manipulated, inflated, and that's
[52:03] Bitcoin. It's just it's just it's a
[52:07] ledger in cyberspace that says Gus like
[52:11] if I ever go to Austria and you let me
[52:14] stay in your couch I give you 500,000
[52:17] Satoshi's that the ledger the Bitcoin
[52:20] ledger just says Gus gave Robin you know
[52:24] and it's it's doing these calculations
[52:27] 24/7 and the the it's we're up to um are
[52:32] we we went so high that we changed the
[52:34] numericals for the hash rate, you know.
[52:36] So, when people realize this, they're
[52:38] going to flock to Bitcoin. There is no
[52:40] ifs or buts. My my couch is free for
[52:42] you, man.
[52:44] Thanks, man. I appreciate it. Come to
[52:46] Austria. I The couch is not huge, but
[52:50] it's definitely free for you. I
[52:51] appreciate it, man. Um, I I'm honestly
[52:54] looking at um a good um good real estate
[52:59] in the in the Alps somewhere, you know,
[53:02] where where Italy borders with Austria.
[53:05] And my wife and I are always looking at
[53:07] real estate. It's so tough cuz when you
[53:09] have the Bitcoin, you're like, man, I
[53:10] really want this house, but you know
[53:12] that the house is going to when you buy
[53:14] the house, it's going to deteriorate and
[53:16] the house is going to get old. And
[53:18] Bitcoin is is hard money. Bitcoin never
[53:20] gets old. It never deteriorates. it only
[53:22] increases in value. So, every time you
[53:24] want to buy something, you're like, "Ah,
[53:26] but eventually we're going to make the
[53:27] move for sure." And then we'll have an
[53:29] inerson podcast hopefully. I would love
[53:32] that, man. Like, even if you're in
[53:34] Italy, I'll come visit you in Italy and
[53:36] it's it's no like it's so close. Yeah,
[53:39] I'm I'm really looking forward to to
[53:40] that. I think we already talked about it
[53:42] one year ago. I hope we can already talk
[53:45] about in person about it in one year.
[53:47] Maybe maybe in two years, whatever that
[53:48] the time frame is. I'm I'm really
[53:50] looking forward to that. How is actually
[53:52] how is actually Bitcoin uh impacted your
[53:54] life and now you have a little a long
[53:56] time you you're really deep into it. You
[53:58] have a truly good understanding of
[54:00] Bitcoin also. You're not just like
[54:02] having Bitcoin but you also really
[54:04] understand the the mission behind it.
[54:06] Yeah. Um it impacted my life in a way
[54:10] that is immeasurable. Right. My um my
[54:13] parents,
[54:15] you know, are from Brazil and in Brazil
[54:18] it's very hard to make a living. Um and
[54:22] and the the money there is worth five
[54:26] times less than the US dollar. Literally
[54:28] $1 is five Brazilian RI and uh so it's
[54:31] very hard. You know, people like in
[54:33] Austria, like in America, they they
[54:35] their main savings account is their
[54:37] house, right? They they they'll buy a
[54:39] house and they'll pay the bank every
[54:41] month. the mortgage and that's how they
[54:43] acrew their value and then one day when
[54:46] they're 80 they die and they leave that
[54:49] that asset for the children and the
[54:51] children will divide you know if you
[54:52] have three children or four children
[54:54] they'll divide them equally amongst
[54:56] themselves right and that's the main way
[54:59] people average people in Brazil Nigeria
[55:03] um wherever you know anywhere in the
[55:05] world that's the way they they have
[55:06] their savings account you know and so
[55:09] I've never thought I would be, you know,
[55:12] this wealthy, you know, and I say that
[55:15] with a lot of um a lot of reverence and
[55:20] respect to God and a lot of gratitude to
[55:24] America,
[55:26] but also mostly gratitude towards
[55:28] Satoshi Nakamoto for discovering digital
[55:31] scarcity. You know, it's like if you
[55:34] have um if you have a an iron log or if
[55:38] you have an iron ore or or a uh a mining
[55:41] business, literal physical ore mining
[55:43] business back in the 1900s, early 1900s,
[55:48] and this man called Henry Ford makes
[55:50] this thing called a truck.
[55:53] You're going to be very grateful to them
[55:55] because now you don't have to have 50
[55:58] horses. All of a sudden, your man can
[56:00] you can just buy a car, buy the truck,
[56:02] the Ford, and you can put a bunch of
[56:06] iron ore in the back of that truck. And
[56:09] that's is kind of a silly example
[56:11] because trucks and cars and motorized
[56:14] vehicle are used for literally
[56:15] everything, right? For all types of
[56:18] exchanging of goods and services and
[56:19] producing uh goods. Um, but you'd be
[56:23] very thankful for that man named Henry
[56:25] Ford. And uh and like Michael Sailor
[56:28] says, you know, when somebody discovers
[56:30] something really important, you're not
[56:33] going to say, you know, screw you, you
[56:35] know, and then Michael Sailor goes on to
[56:37] say, oh, what is that fire? May I borrow
[56:40] some of that fire, sir, and thank you,
[56:43] you know, you show gratitude. So that's
[56:45] the the the sort of respect I have to
[56:47] Satoshi, to America for for giving me
[56:50] this wonderful opportunity. So, Bitcoin
[56:52] changed my life in countless ways
[56:55] because I used to be worried and afraid
[56:57] all the time. What what if I pass away?
[57:00] What if something happens to me? How are
[57:02] my children going to make a living?
[57:04] Well, Bitcoin is taking care of that for
[57:06] me. Even if my heart stops right now, my
[57:10] children will have will have enough
[57:13] money to pay off the house. They'll buy
[57:16] a car cash. They'll be able to buy a
[57:18] second home. Maybe that's the power that
[57:21] Bitcoin gives you. Oh, but you're lucky.
[57:24] You were early. No, no, no. You were
[57:26] still early. Bitcoin is going to do
[57:28] another 5x. It's going to do another
[57:30] 10x. Bitcoin is going to 10 million.
[57:32] Bitcoin is going to 50 million. And it
[57:35] again goes back to that, how am I so
[57:37] certain that Bitcoin is going up
[57:39] forever? I asked the question to the
[57:41] normie, will governments and banksters
[57:45] ever stop printing money?
[57:48] The answer is no. They'll never stop
[57:50] printing money. And it's funny because
[57:53] it's the power they used to have that
[57:56] they flexed for us. You know, they
[57:59] flexed that. I have the power to print
[58:00] money. You listen to me. You pay taxes.
[58:03] Give me back my, you know, give to
[58:04] Caesar what he sees. You know, when the
[58:07] when the when the disciples of Jesus
[58:08] said, you know, Lord,
[58:11] when are you going to overthrow this
[58:13] Roman regime? basically through tax. You
[58:16] know, Jesus said, "No, no, no, no, no,
[58:18] no fighting. Give to Caesar what is
[58:21] Caesar." So, we as Christians have an
[58:23] obligation to pay taxes. But what we
[58:26] didn't see coming is that
[58:28] the money that Caesar uses to control
[58:31] the empire is rapidly rotting. This is
[58:36] why I do believe that I do think that
[58:38] America will FOMO will FOMO into Bitcoin
[58:44] and the world will follow suit. It's
[58:45] going to happen. You know, um we didn't
[58:48] we didn't we couldn't even dream of
[58:50] Black Rockck buying almost a million
[58:53] bitcoins out. We couldn't even dream of
[58:56] a person like Michael Sailor putting all
[58:59] of his cash into and his company's net
[59:02] worth into Bitcoin. We couldn't even
[59:04] dream of of Croup or JP Morgan Chase
[59:08] custody in Bitcoin for their clients,
[59:11] but it happened and it's happening. We
[59:13] couldn't even dream of having a
[59:15] president who's so pro Bitcoin. Trump
[59:17] won't shut up about Bitcoin. That's what
[59:19] people around him say. Trump will always
[59:21] talk about Bitcoin. Um, so it it not
[59:25] only is happening as we speak, but it's
[59:28] going to continue to happen. And
[59:30] eventually of course the fiat
[59:33] the fiat rule ruler will break. So
[59:37] Bitcoin will be the only denominator. So
[59:39] this is why we say Bitcoin is repricing
[59:42] everything because one day everything
[59:44] will be priced in Bitcoin. There's $900
[59:46] trillion of assets on Earth. Real
[59:49] estate, you name it. Cars and and goods
[59:53] and services and gold and stocks and
[59:55] bonds. 900 trillion.
[59:58] Bitcoin only has about three trillion of
[60:00] those 900 trillion. What Bitcoiners are
[60:03] saying, what Satoshi said initially
[60:06] is that all those 900 trillion will flow
[60:08] into Bitcoin and all fiats on earth will
[60:11] break. Will it happen in our lifetime? I
[60:13] don't know. Possibly. But Bitcoin is
[60:15] will repric everything. So this is why I
[60:17] tell people you are early. You are very
[60:20] early. So buy Bitcoin. It's going to
[60:21] change your life.
[60:24] This this is very very wise of you. It's
[60:27] it's very true. Also, I have I have one
[60:30] question. I'm really curious what what
[60:32] what you say. I have one question for
[60:34] every each and every one of my guests
[60:35] that that comes back on the show. The
[60:37] question is, what have you learned since
[60:40] you have last been on the podcast
[60:42] outside of Bitcoin? Uh um I've learned
[60:47] more things about medicine, you know,
[60:51] working with different paramedics
[60:53] and, you know, taking different people
[60:55] with different ailments to the hospital
[60:57] and taking care of people. I've learned
[60:59] that um there is there is more hope than
[61:06] one thinks. I've learned to be more
[61:07] positive. I've learned that the the law
[61:10] of attraction is real. I've learned that
[61:12] if you're a positive person and you
[61:14] think positive and you pray positive and
[61:16] you you hope, wish, and pray and you
[61:19] just you emit that positive energy to
[61:21] the universe, the universe is going to
[61:24] emit it back to you. And same for
[61:26] negativity. If you are angry all the
[61:28] time, you're mean, you're rude, you're
[61:30] disrespectful, you're always yelling at
[61:32] people, the universe is going to throw
[61:35] that back at you. The universe is the we
[61:37] are the universe. The universe is us.
[61:39] The universe is just echoing who you are
[61:42] to yourself. So when you're really nice
[61:44] and polite and loving and kind and
[61:46] compassionate, people are going to miss
[61:48] you when you're not around. People are
[61:50] going to emit that energy back. And I do
[61:52] believe that's what I learned and I'm
[61:54] you know that's what I learned since
[61:56] last time. But also um I'm comprehending
[62:00] it more and more every day because I
[62:02] think we can we we grow our
[62:04] understanding about something grows
[62:06] every day. That's why we need to ponder
[62:08] and meditate on certain things that will
[62:10] make our life more more useful and
[62:12] better. I love that. That's beautiful.
[62:16] It's it's it's something of like or you
[62:18] you you learn you go ahead and you like
[62:20] you adapt and then you learn more about
[62:23] the same things basically and you're
[62:25] trying to to get a little bit wide of
[62:28] circles wide of circles and you're like
[62:30] oh this is true or this is not true. and
[62:34] and and through this continuous
[62:35] learning, if you look back like 5 years,
[62:37] you're like, "Oh shit." Like I I didn't
[62:40] know anything about that like 5 years
[62:42] ago. And and this continuous learning is
[62:45] like so interesting to to to witness. So
[62:49] it will be really fun also to see and I
[62:51] will have this podcast all my life. So,
[62:53] it would be fun to see if we do an
[62:55] episode in, let's say, 20 years from now
[62:58] and see like what what you have said
[63:00] there and how is it in 20 years. I want
[63:02] to do that. I want to do that. We'll
[63:05] definitely do it, Ben. God willing,
[63:06] we'll do it. I I would I would love
[63:09] that. I would love that. I I have to
[63:11] first keep it up and keep my word that I
[63:14] do it all my life. Uh and then in 20
[63:16] years, we can we have to do that. Thank
[63:19] you so much uh Gus for for for being in
[63:22] such a gracious uh uh guest on my show.
[63:26] Um before I let you go, oh I almost
[63:28] forgot. We have an end routine in the
[63:30] podcast um where the previous guest is
[63:32] asking a question for the next guest
[63:33] without knowing who the next guest
[63:35] actually is. Uh it's an interesting
[63:37] question. The the previous guest ask you
[63:39] what must happen in order for you to
[63:42] sell Bitcoin for another asset. Wow,
[63:45] that's that's a huge question, huh? Um,
[63:49] yeah.
[63:50] Um, I would say, you know, God forbid a
[63:55] health scare, you know, uh, I'm not
[63:58] selling Bitcoin. I will live in a
[64:01] cardboard box with my children and I I
[64:03] will feed them. I will I will find food.
[64:06] I will trap meat. I will I will grow. I
[64:09] very good gardener. I will feed my
[64:11] children, but I will not sell my
[64:13] Bitcoin. Um, so I think what would
[64:16] happen for me to actually sell my
[64:18] Bitcoin for some fiat, it would be a
[64:21] health scare, you know?
[64:23] I love that. It's a it's a it's a good
[64:25] one because this is like your life's
[64:29] energy and health and time is the only
[64:31] thing more well more more valuable than
[64:34] than the Bitcoin itself. Thank you so
[64:36] much for being such a courageous uh
[64:40] guest. Um, where can people find you?
[64:42] Where can people reach out to you? Um,
[64:44] Scavuchccini777
[64:46] on Twitter X. Um, it's, you know, the
[64:50] Twitter handle for people who those who
[64:52] don't know, Scavachini is S C A V A N I
[64:57] N I. Scavenachini. Sorry, N I. Yeah,
[65:00] Scava. Scavachini. Sorry, I'm not in the
[65:03] description.
