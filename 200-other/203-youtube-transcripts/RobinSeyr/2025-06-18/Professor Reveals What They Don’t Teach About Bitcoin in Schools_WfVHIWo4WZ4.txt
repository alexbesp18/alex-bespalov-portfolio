[00:00] My whole goal is to get Bitcoin becoming
[00:03] less partisan. I want politicians and
[00:05] voters on both sides of the political
[00:07] aisle to actually appreciate Bitcoin as
[00:09] a tool. You know, my day job is that I'm
[00:11] a high school math teacher teacher in
[00:13] the US. Um I try to marry the two of
[00:15] those together as often as I can, right?
[00:17] Like I'm a lifelong educator and I love
[00:19] teaching people about things. When I I
[00:21] talk to other parents who know that I'm
[00:23] into Bitcoin and they say, "Oh, you're
[00:24] into crypto." And I'll try to
[00:26] differentiate. Bitcoin is a a
[00:27] cryptocurrency the way that the earth is
[00:30] a planet. You know, technically it is
[00:32] true that earth is a planet, but it has
[00:34] a lot of very unique properties that are
[00:36] important for you to understand that
[00:38] make it different and and uniquely
[00:40] positioned as a planet, right? You know,
[00:42] you can contribute more hash power to
[00:44] the network because you have more
[00:46] resources and really what you're doing
[00:48] is just making the the network more
[00:50] secure. You're not printing more Bitcoin
[00:52] because you are able to afford a lot of,
[00:54] you know, powerful machines or something
[00:55] like that. We need to re-educate people
[00:57] about Bitcoin.
[00:59] [Music]
[01:03] Let's jump directly into the topic. But
[01:05] before um uh give us some overview of
[01:08] the few people that don't know who you
[01:10] are and why you're excited about
[01:11] Bitcoin. Yeah. So um uh you know my day
[01:15] job is that I'm a high school math
[01:17] teacher. Uh I teach in the US uh and I
[01:20] teach you know calculus all the way down
[01:22] to algebra uh to kids that usually don't
[01:24] want to be in the room. Uh but we try to
[01:26] make it fun and engaging. So um that's
[01:29] my day job and I got into Bitcoin um
[01:31] really uh because a buddy of mine told
[01:33] me about it um like most people and
[01:36] really pursued it through a mathematical
[01:38] lens. You know, I took the computer
[01:40] science and the math that I knew and
[01:41] tried to make sense of this new
[01:43] invention. Um, and eventually that led
[01:46] me down sort of a rabbit hole of
[01:48] understanding the the power of Bitcoin
[01:50] as a social justice tool and as a
[01:54] implement to actually um better the
[01:57] lives of people all around the world and
[01:58] really strive for the things that
[02:01] progressive folks that are in my circle
[02:03] um you know left-leaning leftenter uh
[02:06] people really care about. And so I ended
[02:08] up writing a book called A Progressives
[02:10] Case for Bitcoin, which is
[02:13] uh an admittedly American title, but the
[02:15] the goal is to try to get people who are
[02:17] sort of left center and skeptical of
[02:19] Bitcoin to actually learn about it as uh
[02:22] their first touch point um thinking
[02:24] about it besides um maybe a financial
[02:27] investment, but really how does it make
[02:29] the world a better place. Um so that's
[02:31] my role in the Bitcoin space. Um I try
[02:33] to marry the two of those together as
[02:35] often as I can, right? like I'm a
[02:36] lifelong educator and I love teaching
[02:38] people about things. Um, and so Bitcoin
[02:41] is just an extension of what I've been
[02:43] doing my whole career uh is teaching
[02:45] people about complicated things and
[02:47] making interesting to them. So that's
[02:48] how I kind of view my role in the
[02:50] Bitcoin space. Awesome. Yeah, I think we
[02:52] need more even more educators. I think
[02:54] we haven't even touched uh any any
[02:58] maturity level in how many educators
[03:00] there are. It's it's it's a few and they
[03:02] are very loud but it's it's like we
[03:04] don't have enough in the depth of it and
[03:08] I try my best to bring as many different
[03:10] people on the podcast as as possible.
[03:12] And it's also great to see that uh more
[03:14] and more teachers and professors uh from
[03:17] kind of the academia where usually it's
[03:20] like hard to get Bitcoin in um is more
[03:23] and more coming into Bitcoin. I guess
[03:25] it's also the math background that that
[03:27] kind of primed you to Bitcoin. Was was
[03:29] math getting it easier for you? Um, for
[03:31] sure. I think that um you know, uh the
[03:34] my story is like this classic moment
[03:37] where I just sort of impulse bought
[03:38] Bitcoin. Um you know, it's kind of funny
[03:40] in hindsight, but I bought $20 worth of
[03:42] Bitcoin, my first ever purchase, and I
[03:45] realized in a in a moment of um of
[03:48] surprise like, oh no, like I don't
[03:50] understand anything about Bitcoin, and
[03:53] if I lose this $20, then my wife is
[03:55] going to probably be mad at me if I
[03:56] can't explain myself. So, I just dove
[03:59] in, you know, during my son's bath time,
[04:01] literally just watching, you know, my
[04:03] first YouTube videos about Bitcoin while
[04:06] my son was splashing around. That was
[04:08] sort of how I got my first uh uh my
[04:10] hooks into it. But it's really, it
[04:13] really was the math background and being
[04:14] able to understand sort of
[04:16] mathematically what's happening with the
[04:17] network and to understand the computer
[04:19] science um behind the problems that it
[04:22] solves. I think it made it a lot easier
[04:24] for me to to really appreciate Bitcoin
[04:26] as a thing that's um feels inevitable,
[04:30] uh is always going to be around, is
[04:31] going to sort of be, you know, invoke
[04:34] the scarcity and and all of the things
[04:35] that Bitcoiners already know. But that
[04:37] was easier for me. Um and I I think to
[04:39] your other point, which is we need more
[04:41] educators, I think that there's a
[04:43] certain way to teach people about things
[04:44] that are complicated and scary. And um a
[04:48] lot of times people in the Bitcoin
[04:50] space, they they lose sight of the fact
[04:51] of where like a normal person is, right?
[04:54] They lose sight of the fact that like
[04:55] when you're introduced the internet and
[04:58] money, people are justifiably skeptical
[05:01] or scared or confused. Um and meeting
[05:04] people where they are and finding a way
[05:05] to talk to people that's respectful and
[05:07] brings them along and keeps them in
[05:09] their zone of proximal development. So
[05:11] it's not just like, oh yeah, by the way,
[05:13] let's think about this really high level
[05:14] concept right away. um that all takes
[05:17] very like a lot of years of skill and
[05:19] honing and practice to do that well. And
[05:22] I think that the more educators that we
[05:24] have in the Bitcoin space, the better we
[05:25] are for it because it's not just like,
[05:28] well, I'm going to I'm passionate about
[05:29] it, so I'm going to talk about it.
[05:31] That's not necessarily the best way to
[05:32] always educate somebody about something
[05:34] that they're scared about or confused
[05:36] or, you know, uncertain. Um, so I feel
[05:38] like the more educators we have, like
[05:40] lifelong educators who have been in
[05:42] classrooms and actually understand how
[05:44] to teach people about things, the better
[05:45] off we'd be. 100%. And then what was the
[05:49] kind of the the intrigue for you to
[05:51] write the progressive case for Bitcoin?
[05:54] Yeah. So I I think once I tapped out and
[05:57] and sort of went through the entire
[05:58] catalog of what's going on
[06:00] mathematically, what's going on with the
[06:02] computer science network, what's the
[06:04] Byzantine general's problem and, you
[06:06] know, the double spending problem and
[06:07] all of these things, you know, my my
[06:11] algorithm on my social media, my YouTube
[06:13] just sent me down this really weird
[06:16] path. At the time, I thought it was
[06:18] weird, right? I was getting ads for
[06:20] survivalist bunkers and, you know,
[06:22] ammunition and all of these things,
[06:24] right? And this is not sort of what my
[06:26] feed normally looks like. And I realized
[06:28] just by clicking on some videos and sort
[06:30] of going really deep down the rabbit
[06:32] hole of sort of Bitcoin and and who are
[06:35] the influencers and who are the
[06:36] proponents of Bitcoin, there's a lot of
[06:38] people who I didn't agree with on uh
[06:41] almost anything, right? I agreed with
[06:43] them about Bitcoin, but uh what they
[06:45] were saying and the language that they
[06:46] were using and sort of the assumptions
[06:48] that they had when they were talking
[06:49] about Bitcoin was a real turnoff for me.
[06:52] And I knew that if I, you know, if I
[06:55] really cared about the people in my life
[06:56] and I wanted them to get on board with
[06:58] Bitcoin and to learn about it, then I
[07:01] was going to have to have a resource
[07:02] that spoke their language and, you know,
[07:04] wasn't about sort of the rightwing and
[07:07] the government. Um, you know, everyone
[07:09] who doesn't eat steak is, you know,
[07:12] worthless, you know, whatever sort of
[07:13] trope you might want to add in there. I
[07:16] knew that the YouTube videos that
[07:18] explained Bitcoin really well also had
[07:21] um a lot of that stuff in there that
[07:22] would turn people off. So I I realized
[07:24] at that moment I said I need to write a
[07:25] book and I don't think it exists. And so
[07:28] if there's ever a book that you want to
[07:29] read and you can't find it, you should
[07:31] write it yourself. And I was stupid
[07:32] enough to start. Um and if I would have
[07:35] known how long it would have taken or
[07:37] how much work it would have taken, I
[07:38] don't think I would have done it. So I'm
[07:40] really grateful that I had no clue what
[07:41] I was getting myself into. Um but I did
[07:44] I did that. I wrote the book and I feel
[07:46] like it's it's clearly changed my life
[07:48] and put me on a whole new trajectory and
[07:51] has put me in this Bitcoin space that
[07:53] I'm really grateful to be in. But it's
[07:55] also given me literally something to
[07:57] hand to a friend, to a colleague, to a
[07:59] neighbor and say, "I know you're
[08:01] skeptical about Bitcoin, but take a look
[08:03] at this. Here's all of the good things
[08:04] that it could do for the for the world
[08:06] and for the people in it." Um, and so
[08:08] I'm grateful that that we have that and
[08:10] and nowadays there's a lot of other
[08:12] resources, too, right? So um that's a
[08:14] good thing that the the tent keeps
[08:16] widening and uh that makes me feel
[08:19] optimistic.
[08:21] How would you deal with with those terms
[08:23] is always really hard for for me because
[08:25] like progressive and like conser like
[08:27] there's always like I feel like almost
[08:29] every second person has a different
[08:30] meaning and definition of those words.
[08:32] How do you define uh a progressive
[08:35] person? Yeah. So, um, and especially,
[08:38] you know, I speak for myself, right?
[08:39] Like one, one of the things about the
[08:41] title of my book is not, um, I never
[08:43] called it the progressive case for
[08:45] Bitcoin, right? Like this isn't the
[08:47] definitive thing. This is just my
[08:48] perspective. Um, and like I said before,
[08:51] the term is the way I use the term is is
[08:54] probably uniquely American, right? So,
[08:57] there's some sort of translation that
[08:58] happens for a European audience
[09:00] especially. Um, but we're talking about
[09:02] people who are at least left center,
[09:05] think that the government does have a
[09:07] role to play in making society fair and
[09:10] equitable, providing a safety net for
[09:12] people um who, you know, live in our
[09:15] society and who uh need help. um who
[09:19] care about, you know, people of all
[09:21] different sort of socioeconomic
[09:23] backgrounds and racial backgrounds and
[09:26] uh you know, regardless of race, sex, uh
[09:29] you know, sexual orientation, all of
[09:31] these things which are very much um seem
[09:34] obvious to me and these are all the
[09:36] things that I care about. Um, and then
[09:38] when I'm watching YouTube videos from a
[09:40] few years ago about about Bitcoin, um,
[09:43] these things are all being sort of put
[09:45] down or talked badly about and all of
[09:47] those things, right? So, um, you know, I
[09:50] don't I'm I'm literally not a member of
[09:53] like the Democratic party in the United
[09:55] States, but if you're trying to think
[09:57] about um which of the two major
[10:00] political parties in the US, I most
[10:02] closely align, it would be the
[10:04] Democrats. Um, but I think that's
[10:06] generally sort of the the basic
[10:08] framework and that means different, you
[10:11] know, the word means different things to
[10:12] different people. But I do think that
[10:14] Bitcoin has a role in helping protect
[10:16] vulnerable people, um, people who are
[10:19] victims of violence, people who are
[10:21] under authoritarian uh, regimes all
[10:24] around the world. Um, I think that
[10:26] people who are sort of systematically
[10:28] underserved by the current system. Um,
[10:31] you know, I think that a lot of
[10:32] Bitcoiners or just a lot of maybe
[10:34] conservatives in the US want to think
[10:36] that all right, well, if you work hard,
[10:38] then you'll succeed. And they they fail
[10:41] to realize that there's a whole system
[10:42] that's really actually suppressing uh a
[10:44] lot of people um within it. And so I
[10:47] think Bitcoin provides opportunities for
[10:49] all of those things to make them better
[10:51] for the people in the world. Um, and I
[10:54] think that's sort of how I would couch
[10:55] the the progressive label within the
[10:59] Bitcoin conversation. Um, and you know,
[11:02] when I started writing the book, I'll be
[11:04] very honest, I don't maybe I'm the only
[11:07] the only one.
[11:10] I, you know, in hindsight, that was very
[11:12] naive of me. I'm certainly not. There's
[11:14] there's a lot of people who actually
[11:15] think very much in the along the same
[11:18] lines and want to see Bitcoin talked
[11:19] about not just as sort of number go up.
[11:21] How do you get more dollars? Um how do
[11:24] you use it as an investment for your
[11:26] bank account for for gaining wealth in
[11:28] US dollars, but actually how can we use
[11:31] it for a social good? How can we make
[11:32] the world a better place? Yeah, I think
[11:34] there's a the the social impact of
[11:37] Bitcoin is I mean the human rights
[11:40] foundation I think is doing a Alex
[11:41] Gladson I think they also doing a great
[11:43] job in in in in discussing that. I think
[11:46] there's a there's a real big impact that
[11:48] Bitcoin has on society completely
[11:52] outside of of money and finances which
[11:54] is super interesting because money just
[11:56] touches everything. So like if if you
[11:58] exchange the money for different money
[12:01] um you are in every sector in every
[12:04] aspect of your life. Uh even for
[12:06] families like you you exchange money for
[12:09] me for birthday maybe like the grandma
[12:11] give some some dollars to to the uh
[12:13] kids. So like in literally every aspect
[12:16] of life money is somehow involved
[12:18] directly or indirectly. So it has a lot
[12:20] of impacts on on how we interact with
[12:24] each other and how we live together. So
[12:25] that that's a really great great point.
[12:28] Yeah. And and I think that this is yeah
[12:30] to your point, right? Money sort of has
[12:32] its uh you know tentacles in everything,
[12:35] right? And so what you want to do if
[12:37] you're trying to describe how Bitcoin is
[12:39] a better version of the system that we
[12:41] have already um the the key thing for me
[12:45] that I've realized through the years is
[12:46] that um almost everybody looks at the
[12:49] world and sees that there's some sort of
[12:50] problem with it. They don't like this
[12:52] thing or this is going in the wrong
[12:53] direction or whatever it is. And if you
[12:56] really want to convince that person that
[12:57] Bitcoin is a tool, find out what that
[13:00] thing is that they care about. What do
[13:01] you care about that you think is going
[13:03] wrong? And and to your point, money is
[13:06] going to be involved in that somehow.
[13:08] And so if it's sort of women's rights
[13:10] around the world, like Bitcoin, you
[13:12] know, helps solve that. If it's the fact
[13:14] that people need to monetize their homes
[13:17] and, you know, be make their homes that
[13:19] they live in a financial instrument for
[13:20] a store of value, like Bitcoin answers
[13:23] that, right? So, whatever it is that
[13:24] they think is the problem, or maybe
[13:26] there's many, meet them where they are
[13:28] and you can kind of make a point about
[13:30] how Bitcoin can help with that. Um, and
[13:34] just be reasonable and like meet them
[13:36] where they are and answer their
[13:37] questions with patience. Um, and not,
[13:40] you know, call names and and all of that
[13:41] stuff. Uh, which is sometimes what can
[13:43] happen at least on social media. Um, so
[13:46] yeah, like think think about the things
[13:49] that they a person cares about and
[13:51] discuss how Bitcoin can help. And I
[13:53] think the human rights foundation you
[13:54] mentioned with Alice Bstein and a lot
[13:56] he's got an amazing team there. They're
[13:59] doing great work. Um the progressive
[14:01] bitcoiner is another you know this is an
[14:04] organization that started off as a
[14:05] podcast and now is become a nonprofit
[14:08] within the United States who can accept
[14:10] tax-free donations to like actually
[14:12] educate and promote Bitcoin as a as a
[14:14] tool for social justice. Um, so there's
[14:16] all of a sudden we're seeing an uptick
[14:18] in in possibly um the community's
[14:22] ability to talk to a different audience.
[14:25] Uh, which I think is important.
[14:28] Super there are so many different
[14:30] avenues I want to go down with, but the
[14:32] first one I think is uh when you talk
[14:33] with progressives um how we define it
[14:37] earlier. Um, what would you say is the
[14:40] like the core values of like progressive
[14:42] values and Bitcoin values that kind of
[14:44] align and made them realize or like
[14:47] Bitcoin is actually aligning the best
[14:49] with with progressive views? Like how
[14:50] was what was like the core values of
[14:52] progressive that you see most aligning
[14:54] with with Bitcoin? Yeah, I think that um
[14:57] one of the Yeah, it's hard to pinpoint
[14:59] one. One of them has to be sort of this
[15:03] growing income and wealth inequality
[15:05] that we see all around the world and
[15:06] especially in the US but this is true
[15:08] elsewhere too. Um this is like one of
[15:11] the top you know campaign talking points
[15:14] among Democrats and progressive
[15:16] politicians in the US right we see this
[15:18] growing wealth inequality and when and
[15:21] sort of the voters are following along.
[15:23] Yeah this is bad this is harmful like if
[15:25] it gets too far then societyy's going to
[15:27] really struggle. All of these things are
[15:29] probably true. Um, but nobody's talking
[15:33] about sort of the root causes of that or
[15:35] taking it one step lower or thinking
[15:37] about what the base level system is
[15:39] doing to en enable that. And so what I
[15:43] like to really do is talk about sort of
[15:46] the role of the current financial system
[15:49] and the the role of Bitcoin and really
[15:51] kind of convince people or talk to them
[15:53] about how um you know this isn't just a
[15:56] couple of um greedy individuals who are
[15:59] able to sort of bend the rules because
[16:02] they're billionaires and the rest of the
[16:04] system is completely healthy. uh this
[16:08] inequality that we see and this wealth
[16:10] extreme wealth inequality. I'm not
[16:12] talking about everybody needs to be
[16:13] equal. I'm talking about extreme wealth
[16:15] inequality that can cause social unrest.
[16:18] That's baked into the system, right? So
[16:20] it's not just like oh well everything's
[16:22] fine except for a couple of bad people,
[16:24] right? If we can get Elon Musk and Jeff
[16:26] Bezos under control and everything's
[16:28] fine. The truth is that the inequality
[16:31] that we see is baked into the system of
[16:33] the current financial markets and we
[16:36] have the Cantalon effect and we see
[16:37] people who have influence over uh
[16:40] government and close connections to the
[16:42] banks get first access to the money and
[16:44] you know inflation is hurting everybody
[16:46] else. They're able to get hard assets
[16:48] and resources um and and it just
[16:51] exacerbates that wealth inequality.
[16:53] Well, that's in the system. So, what can
[16:54] we do about that? And how can we think
[16:56] about Bitcoin as an alternative uh
[16:58] system? So, like that's one example. I
[17:00] think that there's um
[17:03] you know uh equal access and inclusion
[17:05] uh opportunities to really connect with
[17:08] uh progressives in the sense that you
[17:10] know there's people who don't have a
[17:11] bank account and who are being exploited
[17:14] by cashchecking places and payday loan
[17:17] places all across you know my country
[17:19] and saying you know if just because you
[17:21] don't have a bank account and because
[17:23] the banks don't service your
[17:24] neighborhood because there's not a lot
[17:26] enough wealth to make it worth their
[17:28] time. um this sort of snowballs into
[17:31] people being in a tough spot and you're
[17:33] paying more for their financial
[17:35] services. they don't actually have
[17:36] access to financial services the way
[17:38] that um many sort of middle class and
[17:42] affluent people uh in the west do then
[17:45] everything becomes harder and more
[17:46] expensive and bitcoin is sort of an
[17:48] equal opportunity allincclusive anybody
[17:51] can get involved with it way to transact
[17:54] and it's not the only solution that's
[17:57] going to solve this problem but it's an
[17:58] important piece and the further we get
[18:00] down to using Bitcoin as a medium of
[18:02] exchange and a unit of count and in the
[18:05] future this could be a really important
[18:06] part of having everybody on the planet
[18:09] at least has some access to uh financial
[18:12] services the way that um that most
[18:15] affluent people in the west take for
[18:17] granted. Um and so there's a lot of
[18:20] other things too, right? There's, you
[18:21] know, the environment is another issue
[18:23] that progressives care about quite a bit
[18:25] and a lot of people at least in my
[18:27] circles in America
[18:30] um make the mistake of saying, "Well, if
[18:32] something uses energy, then it's bad."
[18:34] and then they don't think about sort of
[18:35] the deeper side of that. So again, I
[18:39] talk about this in my book a lot too. Uh
[18:42] where the way something uses energy and
[18:44] the energy it uses and where it's
[18:46] located is all very much important part
[18:48] of that question. Um and how Bitcoin
[18:50] actually might help um you know the
[18:53] financial you the electrical grid and
[18:56] like uh bootstrapping um renewable
[18:59] energy and all of those things. this
[19:01] these are new arguments for a lot of
[19:02] people who don't really think about
[19:04] Bitcoin a lot. Um, so these are all sort
[19:07] of opportunities depending on what the
[19:08] person cares about. I can kind of have
[19:10] that conversation with them. Yeah, it's
[19:13] it's fascinating because
[19:16] I see a lot of uh discourse like on both
[19:19] sides obviously uh but on the left side
[19:21] I see a lot of discourse like oh it's
[19:22] greedy businessman that's the mistake.
[19:24] Oh like
[19:26] why do you like why are they greedy?
[19:28] like why are they seem to be greedy
[19:31] businessmen? I think it's more about the
[19:33] broken money system and less about the
[19:35] individual. I think like we we we we
[19:38] don't benefit if we now take out Elon
[19:40] Musk like that that does not change
[19:42] anything in in the overall system. It's
[19:44] about like a broken monetary system and
[19:46] not like oh like if those people will
[19:49] contribute more to society obviously
[19:50] everything no like we like new people
[19:53] will be born in the same money system at
[19:55] the same incentives like that that's
[19:57] nothing nothing changes there. Yeah and
[19:59] and I think that's the best way to put
[20:01] it right like what you have is not just
[20:03] sort of a bad thing that's on top and
[20:05] you can just cut it off. uh it's it's
[20:07] interwoven, right? So the the badness
[20:10] that we're talking about this wealth
[20:11] extreme wealth inequality is certainly
[20:14] in the inside the system. And I think
[20:16] it's interesting, right? Like the idea
[20:18] that there's a couple of greedy
[20:19] businessmen part that's part of the
[20:22] beauty of the design of Bitcoin, right?
[20:24] is the realization that people are going
[20:26] to act in their own self-interest and
[20:28] they're going to be greedy and how can I
[20:30] create a system like that's part of the
[20:32] beauty of Bitcoin to say if everybody
[20:34] acts in their own self-interest and is
[20:36] greedy then nobody can manipulate the
[20:38] system and nobody can gain control of it
[20:41] and nobody can sort of print more
[20:43] Bitcoin everybody is acting in their own
[20:45] self-interest and if you you know we can
[20:47] call that greedy that's fine that's
[20:49] that's okay but we have to realize that
[20:51] all humans will act that way so the one
[20:53] of beautiful things about Bitcoin is
[20:55] they say, "Well, instead of creating a
[20:58] system where if you're really really
[20:59] greedy,
[21:01] then you get more and because you have
[21:03] more resources, you get to be more
[21:04] greedy and because you're more greedy,
[21:06] you get more resources." That's our
[21:07] current financial system. And so, you
[21:10] don't necessarily blame the one
[21:12] individual for being greedy because
[21:14] everybody acts in that greedy sort of
[21:16] way. But what you do is you try to come
[21:18] up with a new system that just because
[21:20] you're putting more resources into it
[21:21] doesn't mean you get more resources out
[21:24] and it's more fair, right? Like if you
[21:26] know you can contribute more hash power
[21:28] to the network because you have more
[21:30] resources and really what you're doing
[21:32] is just making the the network more
[21:34] secure. You're not printing more bitcoin
[21:36] because you are able to afford a lot of
[21:38] you know powerful machines or something
[21:40] like that. So I think that that sort of
[21:43] uh incentive system that we have now is
[21:47] detrimental to our society in lots of
[21:49] obvious ways because having more
[21:52] resources allows you to get more
[21:53] resources and that's a sort of a runaway
[21:55] exponential problem. Bitcoin is
[21:58] absolutely not set up like that. they're
[22:00] able to come up with, you know, Satoshi
[22:03] is able to come up with a system where
[22:04] if you um are greedy, then what you're
[22:07] doing is helping the network and helping
[22:09] the system instead of enriching
[22:11] yourself.
[22:12] Yeah, it's a perfect system of aligning
[22:14] incentives between everyone from from
[22:18] the bottom till the top like everyone is
[22:20] benefiting. If if if uh Michael Sailor
[22:23] is buying more Bitcoin, this is
[22:25] benefiting the whole network because all
[22:27] the network is is getting stronger with
[22:28] it. like it's it's it's it's it's a
[22:31] beautiful beautiful system. How is how
[22:33] do you think this will change
[22:35] governments when you see now the
[22:37] political uh system um a lot of it is
[22:41] funded by central banks and by depth and
[22:44] almost most of it uh and only a little
[22:47] part comes from actual taxes. Um how do
[22:50] how do you think Bitcoin will will
[22:51] change the governments if Bitcoin
[22:54] actually takes out the money printer
[22:56] completely?
[22:57] Yeah. And I think that um you know I I I
[23:01] think that this is possible. I think
[23:03] that there's a world in which we use
[23:04] Bitcoin as um
[23:07] as the global financial system and
[23:09] government still exist, right? There's
[23:11] powerful entities right now that are
[23:13] powerful and influence the world even
[23:15] though they don't print money, right?
[23:17] Like Amazon and Walmart and Disney don't
[23:20] print money, but they're very powerful
[23:22] and important players in the global um
[23:24] system. So I think governments can also
[23:27] be that too. Um and the problem is that
[23:30] the printing of money to fund deficits
[23:33] to fund the spending that the
[23:35] politicians vote for uh layers an
[23:38] obuscation across the whole system. Like
[23:41] it's hard for voters to see what we're
[23:44] spending, why we're spending it, and
[23:46] where the money is coming from because
[23:48] it's all sort of hidden behind a layer
[23:50] of money printing. And what that means
[23:52] is it's harder for voters and
[23:55] democracies to hold their politicians
[23:57] accountable and say, "You voted to spend
[23:59] the money this way. You that means my
[24:01] taxes went up and that means that I
[24:04] don't like you anymore and I don't want
[24:05] the money spent like that." And so then
[24:07] the people have a voice and they can
[24:08] vote that person out. Um, but we don't
[24:12] have that right now because what what
[24:14] happens is everybody gets a little bit
[24:15] of something from their politician. The
[24:17] taxes really don't go up ever or by a
[24:20] lot. um because it's being funded by the
[24:22] money printer. And so there's no
[24:24] accountability. There's no transparency
[24:26] on the part of the politicians to say
[24:27] this is a priority. It costs money and
[24:30] this is how I want to do it. This is I
[24:32] want to raise taxes and if you and if
[24:35] you think this is a priority and you
[24:37] think we should raise taxes to do this,
[24:39] then vote for me. Um nobody has to do
[24:41] that right now. And so you get a bunch
[24:43] of politicians who all want to spend
[24:45] money and this is left and right. um
[24:48] Democrats and Republicans, but they're
[24:51] never held accountable to say, "Oh, this
[24:53] is how your spending affected me in an
[24:55] obvious way, right? We know that the
[24:58] central bank printing money to fund
[25:00] these deficits and and buy all the bonds
[25:02] and and allow the government to run
[25:04] these deficits hurts people sort of um
[25:07] in an an opaque way because the
[25:10] inflation goes up and it's harder to buy
[25:12] goods and services. But there's no
[25:14] direct link to your policies have caused
[25:18] this bad thing to happen. And so if we
[25:20] are in a system where central brains
[25:23] central banks can't print money anymore
[25:24] because the population demands that we
[25:28] use Bitcoin because it's a more fair and
[25:30] just system. Then all of a sudden the
[25:32] the politicians can absolutely come up
[25:34] and say, "Listen, I think there should
[25:36] be a safety net for people who get hurt
[25:37] on the job and the government should
[25:39] step in and help those people and this
[25:41] is what it costs. And if you think
[25:42] that's that's worthwhile and something
[25:44] that our society should have, then vote
[25:46] for me and this is what your taxes will
[25:48] be. It's a much better system than what
[25:51] we have now, which is everybody gets
[25:53] something. It all runs very
[25:54] inefficiently. It's all sort of
[25:56] promises. Nobody has to actually account
[25:58] for what their what their policies are
[26:01] costing. Um I I would much rather see a
[26:03] system like that in place. And that
[26:05] includes things like, you know,
[26:07] unemployment insurance or health care or
[26:10] education or uh, you know, going to war.
[26:13] Like I feel like the the people, the
[26:15] voting populace in democracy should have
[26:17] much more of a direct link to this is
[26:21] something I care about and maybe you do
[26:23] like you need to defend your country and
[26:25] going to war is the right call and
[26:26] everybody thinks so and so you vote for
[26:28] that or something like that. But I think
[26:29] that uh right now we have a system that
[26:31] we're led by people who don't have any
[26:33] accountability. Um, so I feel like
[26:35] that's the number one way that I see
[26:37] Bitcoin
[26:38] influencing in the long term. This is
[26:40] not like something that happens in the
[26:42] next election cycle, but I do think that
[26:44] it has a potential to influence the way
[26:47] politicians operate in the long term.
[26:50] Um, and in the short term, you know, my
[26:53] whole goal is to get um, Bitcoin
[26:56] becoming less partisan. Yeah, just like
[26:59] I want I want politicians and voters on
[27:02] both sides of the political aisle to
[27:04] actually appreciate Bitcoin as a tool um
[27:07] and realize that it it could do bad
[27:10] things, but it could do a lot of really
[27:11] good things, too. And the more people
[27:12] that we have using it for good things,
[27:14] the better our world will be. Um and so
[27:17] my goal eventually, like in the short
[27:19] term, within my lifetime, is to really
[27:21] uh you serve as a proponent for Bitcoin
[27:24] being treated like well the internet.
[27:25] there's no politicians who are saying we
[27:27] should get rid of the internet now. Um,
[27:29] and just sort of something that exists
[27:31] and something that we need to deal with.
[27:33] Um, but it's not a hyperartisan issue
[27:36] where Democrats and Republicans or left
[27:38] versus right are fighting about it
[27:40] anymore. I just want it to be a normal
[27:42] thing that that exists. I love that and
[27:45] and I want to get into this uh also with
[27:48] Donald Trump and and and the Bitcoin
[27:50] conference that was there and stuff like
[27:51] that.
[27:52] One thing um before that is I love the
[27:56] idea of a free competition between
[27:59] ideas. I think that's that's what
[28:01] politics actually should be like.
[28:03] Politics is the place where we negotiate
[28:05] between each other how we live together
[28:09] and the best ideas should win in that
[28:12] and not like the not the ideas with the
[28:14] best funding or not the ideas that kind
[28:17] of sound good but actually not good
[28:18] because they have not been done enough
[28:20] research. So like that there should be a
[28:22] free competition of ideas. I think
[28:24] Switzerland is a a good one good
[28:27] indicator of like how
[28:30] direct democracy can work. Uh it's not
[28:33] perfect. It's it's far from perfect
[28:35] probably. I'm not from Switzerland. Uh
[28:37] but I I think free competition of ideas
[28:40] is always the best case and taking away
[28:43] the money printer is really important
[28:45] for that. And I have one more uh
[28:47] interesting point and I'm curious what
[28:49] you think about you said in the
[28:50] beginning of like Amazon and Apple
[28:52] cannot create money. I would almost
[28:55] argue because they have such a good
[28:58] credit rating and get like like millions
[29:01] of or billions of dollars for like 0%
[29:04] interest rate. Like if someone askked me
[29:06] like, "Oh, do you want like a billion
[29:08] dollars with 0% interest rates and you
[29:10] have to pay it back in 10 years?" Yeah,
[29:11] of course I'll take it. I'll buy some
[29:13] Bitcoin and I'll take give give you the
[29:14] billion dollars back in 10 years. It's
[29:16] almost like they don't have money
[29:18] printer, but it's almost a money
[29:20] printer, indirect money printer. How do
[29:22] you how do you look at that? No, and I I
[29:25] mean you're right. I think that that's
[29:26] this is sort of the rich getting richer
[29:28] canalon effect thing, right? where like
[29:30] in the current system the people who are
[29:33] closest to the money printer and you're
[29:34] talking about big corporations who have
[29:36] great credit ratings and a lot of you
[29:38] know sort of access to politicians and
[29:40] all of these and the banks they benefit
[29:42] from the money printing for sure right
[29:45] um I think that um you know but my I
[29:48] think the point I'm trying to make is
[29:50] that a lot of people a lot of bitcoiners
[29:54] especially will say if the if the
[29:56] government can't print money anymore
[29:57] then it will cease to exist
[29:59] And so all I'm trying to say is that if
[30:02] the government can't print money
[30:03] anymore, it can still serve to be sort
[30:06] of our societal like how do we want
[30:08] society to look and it can also like tax
[30:12] and spend a lot of money. It just can't
[30:15] create the money out of thin air. So So
[30:17] I'm only making the point that
[30:18] governments can still exist without a
[30:20] money printer and they'll probably be a
[30:22] lot better and more efficient and more
[30:24] responsive and more transparent if they
[30:26] do. So I think that I I agree with your
[30:28] point on a technical level like giant
[30:31] corporations certainly benefit the most.
[30:34] Um and banks I include banks in there
[30:37] too, right? Banks are obviously creating
[30:38] the money by issuing debt. Um all of
[30:42] those institutions benefit from the
[30:44] printing of money and uh but they they
[30:47] exist and they're powerful forces in the
[30:49] global economy without necessarily being
[30:51] a government that prints money. And so I
[30:53] think that the governments that we know
[30:54] today don't have to look like they they
[30:56] do now, right? Like like the idea of how
[30:59] we govern ourselves and how sort of uh
[31:03] like we decide what systems are in place
[31:05] to to have a rule of law and to have
[31:08] sort of a free market and all of the
[31:09] things that we want um are all sort of
[31:13] negotiable throughout history, right, in
[31:15] the long when we we zoom out. And so I
[31:18] do think that there's a place for
[31:20] governments to exist or for some sort of
[31:22] entity to actually uphold the values
[31:24] that society cares about without
[31:26] necessarily them being able to directly
[31:28] print money the way that central banks
[31:30] do right now. Yeah, absolutely. We just
[31:32] have to look at at the history where uh
[31:35] we had hard money standards, we had
[31:38] pre-monetary
[31:39] uh ancient uh governments, we had like
[31:42] Rome, Egypt, like all those places where
[31:44] there was not crazy money printing like
[31:46] now and we still had governments in in
[31:48] in some capacity, some form very
[31:50] different but some some form. So it's
[31:53] like for me it's a no-brainer that we
[31:57] will have some structure um of
[31:59] government. Um it's just a big question
[32:02] of mine how how it will actually look
[32:04] like
[32:06] because the government government is
[32:08] really depending right now a lot on the
[32:09] money printer uh and the popularity
[32:12] contest of it. I mean the past
[32:16] election with Donald Trump was was one
[32:18] big thing like it's more of a like Obama
[32:20] kind of discovered social media for him
[32:22] and and Donald Trump discovered podcasts
[32:24] for him. So like every politician kind
[32:26] of discovers some new media that he
[32:28] really um tries to to to um yeah use to
[32:34] to get the more popular votes. Um, which
[32:37] leads me to the question of like how do
[32:39] you actually see now for the progressive
[32:41] case of Bitcoin and now in the past one
[32:43] and a half years we have seen uh Donald
[32:46] Trump and the Republican party and Sut
[32:48] Lumis and like so so many people from
[32:50] the Republican party um being really
[32:54] loud about Bitcoin and also being on the
[32:56] on stage at the like biggest Bitcoin
[32:58] conferences and it's quite silent from a
[33:03] European standpoint like I'm not in
[33:04] American politics but just from
[33:06] attractive feeling is quite silent
[33:08] around like Harris and and Biden and AOC
[33:12] and and those are literally the only
[33:14] three people I can name from the
[33:15] demographic now.
[33:17] Yeah. Yeah. Um so there's a couple of
[33:21] responses, right? So last year um at the
[33:24] Bitcoin conference in Nashville, Donald
[33:26] Trump uh took the stage. Um, and earlier
[33:29] that day, the day that Donald Trump
[33:31] spoke at the Bitcoin conference, I was
[33:34] on the same stage on the main stage of
[33:36] the Bitcoin conference in Nashville, and
[33:38] I was speaking to two different
[33:39] Democratic lawmakers who are elected
[33:41] members of Congress about Bitcoin and
[33:43] about its power to transform the world
[33:45] into a better place and how it's
[33:47] actually uh important. So, it's not as
[33:50] if there's no Democrats who are seeing
[33:53] the light and understanding that this is
[33:55] important concept. Okay. Um, but you're
[33:58] right. I think that the sort of the
[33:59] volume and the information that's being
[34:02] fed out into the media is definitely not
[34:04] balanced. And so I I think that's a
[34:07] major concern. So
[34:09] I I think and I I expressed this in in
[34:12] multiple ways to multiple people. the
[34:16] right call for Democrats and for
[34:18] progressive people in the U the US is to
[34:20] say Donald Trump says he's in favor of
[34:24] Bitcoin,
[34:25] but look at all of the things he's doing
[34:28] with these meme coins and the crypto and
[34:31] to enrich himself. And really, Donald
[34:34] Trump is is falling into the very worst
[34:37] stereotypes of what we mean by crypto
[34:40] because he's just self-deing and
[34:42] grifting and scamming and get, you know,
[34:44] offering people, you know, chicken
[34:46] dinner if they buy a million dollars
[34:48] worth of his, you know, silly coin. He's
[34:51] not really acting like a Bitcoiner. He's
[34:53] not actually acting like somebody who
[34:55] cares about the network and the system
[34:58] that's that's being created. And so what
[35:01] that does is it provides an opportunity
[35:03] and you know, who knows if they'll take
[35:05] it, but it provides an opportunity for
[35:07] Democrats to say, "Donald Trump says he
[35:10] likes Bitcoin, but here's what Bitcoin's
[35:11] really about." Or, "Donald Trump is
[35:14] actually using all of this stuff to
[35:16] enrich himself and to and make his
[35:19] family a lot of money and sort of
[35:21] rugpull a bunch of people." But here are
[35:23] all of the pro-social reasons that we we
[35:26] care about Bitcoin. So I think that what
[35:28] it does is it provides an opportunity
[35:29] for Democrats to distinguish themselves
[35:32] from Trump in a way to say not let
[35:34] Donald Trump likes Bitcoin so Bitcoin is
[35:36] bad. But Donald Trump doesn't even
[35:39] understand Bitcoin. He's not actually
[35:40] using it well. He's not being a faithful
[35:43] proponent of the technology. He's just
[35:46] using it to get himself rich. And I
[35:48] think that there's a there's a great
[35:49] opportunity for Democrats to to take
[35:52] that time to talk and point and run with
[35:54] it and say here look at all the
[35:55] pro-social things that we could be doing
[35:57] helping people in need more inclusivity
[36:00] helping the environment like these are
[36:01] all the good things that Bitcoin does.
[36:04] Now, you know, I was lucky enough to
[36:06] actually be able to say this to some
[36:08] people who who matter in terms of the
[36:10] democratic politics recently, which is
[36:13] not politicians, but sort of the the
[36:15] think tanks and the organizations that
[36:17] advise politicians. You know, I was in a
[36:19] room with people and and they were
[36:21] asking really thoughtful and interesting
[36:23] questions. So this is like a total shift
[36:26] from what we saw a year ago, two years
[36:28] ago from Democrats is the people who are
[36:31] doing the advising and the researching
[36:33] and the sort of the recommending about
[36:35] what the campaign topic should be and
[36:37] how people should talk about them on the
[36:39] campaign trail are actually realizing
[36:42] that the Democrats screwed up. They're
[36:44] actually asking really thoughtful
[36:46] questions. um they actually see this as
[36:49] an opportunity to distinguish themselves
[36:52] from Donald Trump in a way that's pro-
[36:54] Bitcoin and the ethos behind Bitcoin and
[36:57] not just sort of attaching, you know,
[36:59] campaign slogan to it. And so whether or
[37:02] not that actually gets traction and and
[37:05] takes off and we see a a distinct shift
[37:08] in the next political cycle, I I can't
[37:10] say. But I can say that the people
[37:12] advising the politicians are starting to
[37:14] realize what needs to happen and the
[37:17] people advising the politicians are
[37:19] asking really good questions and the
[37:21] people advising the politicians are
[37:23] realizing that that a change needs to
[37:25] happen. So I'm optimistic now that like
[37:29] when we go forward and we see sort of
[37:30] into the future, what are what are
[37:32] Democratic politicians look like in
[37:34] terms of Bitcoin? I'm I'm hopeful that
[37:36] we see a shift. Um, I can't guarantee
[37:39] it, but I think that the first baby
[37:41] steps are being made now, uh, you know,
[37:43] going back even a couple of months. Um,
[37:46] and sure, they they are behind the
[37:48] Republicans in terms of paying lip
[37:50] service to, um, to Bitcoin in a way that
[37:54] like gets Bitcoiners all excited. Um,
[37:58] but they're starting to do that work and
[38:00] I feel like if they do it well, then we
[38:02] might actually see something that's more
[38:04] fruitful, more helpful for Bitcoin, more
[38:06] like true to the ethos of Bitcoin, which
[38:09] is like a new system, helps people,
[38:12] inclusive, um, helps the environment as
[38:15] opposed to just a Trump coin that you
[38:18] get to have dinner with the president if
[38:19] you are willing to spend millions of
[38:21] dollars. This, you know, this is not
[38:23] actually helping anybody except Donald
[38:25] Trump and his family, right? So, I feel
[38:27] like there's really a distinction that
[38:29] we can make and I'm hopeful that we're
[38:31] going to start seeing that distinction.
[38:33] Let's take a break for a moment and
[38:35] appreciate the beauty that Coin
[38:38] Vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[38:40] watches. Those watches are the most
[38:43] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[38:46] that you are a true Bitcoiner. and Coin
[38:49] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[38:52] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[38:55] watch collections. You have the date of
[38:57] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[39:01] there and of course also the block
[39:03] height and which epoch we are currently
[39:06] in. I love the level of detail they put
[39:09] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[39:11] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[39:14] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[39:17] love those watches. so so much. And now
[39:20] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[39:22] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[39:25] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[39:26] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[39:29] first way is you put it on a hardware
[39:31] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[39:34] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[39:37] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[39:40] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[39:43] if you check out the link in the
[39:44] description, you even get 5% off if you
[39:47] use the code Robin. And the second way
[39:50] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[39:53] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[39:56] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[39:59] They will personalize for you a
[40:02] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[40:04] your individual situation. They will
[40:07] show you how you can secure your own
[40:09] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[40:12] enough. You also have to keep all your
[40:14] devices secure. One topic that is
[40:16] overlooked often is the inheritance
[40:18] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[40:22] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[40:24] a plan for that in place already? And
[40:27] last but not least, if you're in a
[40:28] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[40:31] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[40:33] that, head over to the
[40:35] bitcoinway.com/roin
[40:38] to get a 30 minute free call. And just a
[40:41] quick side note, I will be for the first
[40:44] time ever speaking at the Bitcoin Prague
[40:47] event in June. It will be absolutely
[40:50] legendary and I'm really looking forward
[40:52] to seeing all of you there. You can get
[40:54] your ticket in the link down in the
[40:57] description of Bitcoin Prague. And very
[40:59] important, use code Robin to get 10% off
[41:03] your ticket. I'm really looking forward
[41:05] seeing you there. That would be awesome
[41:06] if the Democratic Party could really
[41:11] embrace Bitcoin, not crypto. Like if
[41:14] they are having the stance of like uh
[41:16] it's an important technology and Bitcoin
[41:20] is the true revolution and we have to
[41:23] crack down on the crypto scams. I think
[41:25] that's something um a lot of Bitcoiners
[41:28] were disappointed with with Trump where
[41:30] they're like, "Hey, why does he do
[41:31] shitcoining?
[41:33] Why does he talk about crypto all the
[41:35] time when it's actually about Bitcoin?"
[41:37] Uh and uh you you could I I don't see it
[41:42] happening anytime soon on like a on the
[41:45] high level of like presidential debates.
[41:47] Um but even uh also like um what is his
[41:50] name? JD Vance spoke at the Bitcoin
[41:53] conference and I I was kind of
[41:56] disappointed with his speech. I mean,
[41:58] it's great that the vice president is at
[41:59] the Bitcoin conference. I I get it. But
[42:02] it it's been he like it's been the only
[42:07] really good thing that he kind of said
[42:08] is like, "Oh, I own Bitcoin." Like I
[42:10] think that's the only real thing like,
[42:12] "Oh, like yeah, like you you want the
[42:14] politicians to like at least own own
[42:16] Bitcoin so the incentives are aligned."
[42:19] The other things is like like crypto and
[42:22] like oh web free and what's going on
[42:23] with those things. I don't know like
[42:25] there's there's not a really talk. If
[42:28] Democrats could embrace that that would
[42:29] be awesome. And and what I can tell you
[42:32] first of all we already knew JD Vance
[42:33] owned Bitcoin, right? So like that's
[42:36] like that's good. I you know good for
[42:39] him. Uh I think it's probably going to
[42:41] work out well for him in the long run.
[42:43] Um what I can say is um I was in the
[42:47] room with other you know crypto people
[42:50] talking you know at this round table
[42:53] talking to the to the think tanks that
[42:55] advise Democratic politicians
[42:58] and I I went into that room and I was
[43:00] unapologetic and I said from the very
[43:02] beginning I'm going to be Bitcoin only.
[43:03] I'm going to talk about the benefits of
[43:05] Bitcoin. I'm going to talk about the
[43:06] scams and the grip associated with
[43:08] crypto and why that's a justifiable uh
[43:11] you know stereotype to make 99% of the
[43:14] time. Um and the people in the room who
[43:18] were on the crypto side of the table
[43:19] were very they were polite and they were
[43:22] like okay yeah but like there's other
[43:23] projects and I'm like well that's fine
[43:25] but I I'm only Bitcoin. the people on
[43:27] the campaign side of the table, the
[43:29] people who were in politics and who were
[43:31] part of the democratic establishment,
[43:35] it was the first time that they had ever
[43:36] heard somebody say Bitcoin only or
[43:39] Bitcoin and not crypto. And and I don't
[43:43] and and they asked really thoughtful
[43:45] follow-up questions. They wanted to
[43:46] understand more about it. And when I
[43:48] answered their questions, they had more
[43:50] questions for me. And so what happened
[43:52] was there was a curiosity there in that
[43:54] conversation to understand what exactly
[43:56] is going on with Bitcoin and why does a
[43:58] Bitcoiner think it's all different and
[44:00] all of these crypto people are saying,
[44:02] "Oh, no, no, we're all together." They
[44:05] were very interested in that
[44:06] conversation. Now, ultimately the
[44:10] talking points and the and the
[44:13] and what's being the marching orders
[44:15] given to the politicians are is going to
[44:16] be stemming probably from campaign
[44:18] donations and all of that, right? And so
[44:21] I can't say that that the Bitcoin only
[44:25] in like the principled approach to
[44:27] saying Bitcoin only is going to
[44:28] overshadow the millions and millions of
[44:31] dollars that like XRP is going to be
[44:33] donating to Democratic politicians. I
[44:35] wish it would. Um but I can say that the
[44:38] people in the room who were involved in
[44:40] not in the crypto spot part but like the
[44:42] campaign part were really interested in
[44:45] in in engaging me in that conversation
[44:47] and say well why do you think that it's
[44:49] different and why is it important that
[44:51] it's different and what are the talking
[44:52] what is the opportunity here? So and and
[44:55] I don't think that that Donald Trump or
[44:58] JD Vance or most Republicans have ever
[45:01] had that conversation. I think they lump
[45:04] it all together. You can tell by the way
[45:06] that Donald Trump talks about it, the
[45:08] way JD Vance talks about it, they think
[45:10] it's all the same. And they're really
[45:11] just looking for an avenue. How can I
[45:14] enrich myself? How can I release a Trump
[45:17] coin? How can I release a Melania coin?
[45:19] How can I get just a pump and dump scam
[45:21] going about this? That's not what
[45:23] Bitcoin is about. It's it's the opposite
[45:25] of what Bitcoin is about. And so for
[45:28] really highlevel campaign operatives in
[45:30] the Democratic party to hear me be able
[45:33] to articulate
[45:34] here's what Bitcoin does, here's how
[45:36] Donald Trump is misusing that name,
[45:39] here's how all of the ways he's being
[45:40] grippy and scammy and we have an
[45:42] opportunity to differentiate from them
[45:45] from them. It was a is a huge 180 in
[45:48] terms of just listening and engaging and
[45:50] having a conversation. So that makes me
[45:52] super optimistic. I'm really happy that
[45:54] that was able to happen and and we'll
[45:56] see what happens going forward, but
[45:58] we've made really good first steps.
[46:01] That's super interesting seeing that
[46:05] because we never think about that that
[46:07] they maybe never heard about Bitcoin
[46:09] only because we are in like a very small
[46:11] bubble and we always have the the bias
[46:16] of ourselves. So, we think just because
[46:18] I know it and like most of my Bitcoin
[46:20] friends know it and we talk about it on
[46:21] the podcast all the time, Bitcoin only,
[46:23] that doesn't mean the whole world caught
[46:25] on to it. And the opposite is true. It's
[46:28] just like a very small subject of the
[46:31] world. And so those politicians are
[46:33] like, "Wait, there's a group that just
[46:35] just likes Bitcoin. It's like they're
[46:36] really passionate about Bitcoin only and
[46:38] they're rightfully uh saying to
[46:41] everything else that's a scam." It's
[46:43] just a sign that we're early and in a
[46:44] very small bubble. Yeah. I know. And and
[46:47] I think first of all, I it was the best
[46:49] part of of my day when that happened.
[46:51] But this is a conversation I have at the
[46:53] like the bus stop, right? When I I talk
[46:55] to other parents who know that I'm into
[46:57] Bitcoin. And they say, "Oh, you're into
[46:59] crypto." And I'll try to differentiate,
[47:01] you know, and the metaphor that, you
[47:03] know, I used recently on Twitter and I
[47:05] tried at the bus stop was, you know,
[47:06] well, you know, somebody will say, well,
[47:09] technically Bitcoin is just a
[47:10] cryptocurrency, right? Well, you know,
[47:13] Bitcoin is a a cryptocurrency the way
[47:15] that the earth is a planet. You know,
[47:17] technically it is true that earth is a
[47:20] planet, but it has a lot of very unique
[47:22] properties that are important for you to
[47:23] understand that make it different and
[47:26] uniquely positioned as a planet, right?
[47:29] Like so to understand like earth as an
[47:31] importance in the in our solar system is
[47:34] the same way you can understand bitcoin
[47:35] is important within you know all
[47:38] cryptocurrencies. that's completely
[47:39] unique, completely different. And when I
[47:42] say unique, I mean in the precise
[47:43] mathematical sense, right? There's
[47:45] there's literally only one of them. Um,
[47:47] and so I feel like that's an important
[47:49] conversation. I've also had a
[47:51] conversation recently in in my local
[47:53] networks with people who are in
[47:54] traditional finance who
[47:57] make a lot of money in the current fiat
[48:00] system who think Bitcoin is a scam and
[48:03] really they're involved in all of this
[48:05] sort of moving money around charging
[48:07] fees being sort of rent seekers. That's
[48:09] how they make their living. And they
[48:11] think that Bitcoin is a scam. Well,
[48:12] they're actually starting to for the
[48:14] first time in my life ask thoughtful
[48:17] questions and not dismiss me immediately
[48:19] because I'm into Bitcoin. They're
[48:21] actually engaging me in a really
[48:23] sophisticated way and asking really
[48:24] intelligent questions. So, you know, the
[48:28] politicians, the people in traditional
[48:30] finance, the guy at the bus stop, like
[48:32] everybody I'm talking to about Bitcoin
[48:34] now is treating that conversation
[48:37] differently than they did four years
[48:39] ago. Um, so I think this cycle is
[48:42] introducing I'm not saying mass
[48:44] adoption, FOMO, buy in now. What I'm
[48:46] saying is the conversation is more
[48:48] nuanced. It's more respectful. It's more
[48:50] interested. It's more educated. Um, and
[48:53] so that has to bode well for Bitcoin as
[48:55] a technology going forward. I love the
[48:58] Earth analogy. I think I will steal that
[49:00] in in some some regards. I think that's
[49:03] really good. Um, and because I get it
[49:05] all the time from like family members
[49:07] like, "Oh, like but Bitcoin is a crypto,
[49:09] right?" Like, yeah, like technically
[49:12] you could like you're right.
[49:16] Uh, yeah, that's a really good uh good
[49:18] comparison. Um, talk to us about the the
[49:22] political cost or the political
[49:24] opportunity that someone has when they
[49:27] speaking out about Bitcoin. Um because I
[49:30] think it it kind of shifts now where
[49:32] politicians now finding out that hey
[49:35] speaking about Bitcoin can actually
[49:37] boost yourself in the political space
[49:40] where just a few years ago nobody really
[49:42] wanted to even if they had Bitcoin even
[49:44] they had like a conviction with Bitcoin
[49:46] they're like oh like I don't know I
[49:47] think Cumin the earliest that I remember
[49:50] that that really like spoke out about
[49:52] Bitcoin but obviously I'm I'm not into
[49:54] American politics that much so I don't
[49:55] know. Um so how's this change? How did
[49:59] you see that happening? So I I think
[50:02] you're right. Cynthia Lemus is certainly
[50:04] the first politician like a highlevel
[50:07] like politician that I know about that
[50:09] talk about Bitcoin in that way and and
[50:11] she has done a fairly good job given her
[50:13] role to represent the state of Wyoming.
[50:16] Um you know she can't necessarily only
[50:19] think about Bitcoin. She has to think
[50:21] about everything and how it's regulated
[50:22] and how it's treated by the government.
[50:24] But she's done a really good job of of
[50:26] sort of promoting Bitcoin only, Bitcoin
[50:29] focused legislation and ideas while
[50:31] still having to include the other stuff
[50:33] because those things exist. So Cynthia
[50:36] Lumis is a great model of a politician
[50:38] who's sort of unapologetically talking
[50:40] about Bitcoin. I mentioned her in my
[50:42] book, which is to say that if you go
[50:44] down the list of things that Cynthia
[50:45] Lumus really cares about and her
[50:47] campaign promises and what she campaigns
[50:50] on, I agree with her about Bitcoin and I
[50:52] agree with her on nothing else. So like,
[50:55] you know, like I think that gay people
[50:57] should be allowed to get married or that
[50:59] abortion services should be allowed, you
[51:01] know, for people who need them. Uh all
[51:03] sort like I think that there should be
[51:04] sex education taught in schools. like
[51:07] everything else I disagree with her
[51:08] about, but I agree with her about
[51:09] Bitcoin. I think that that the Democrats
[51:13] right now are in a position where there
[51:16] and I think this is justifiable. A lot
[51:18] of like maximist Bitcoiners are going to
[51:20] sort of just brush this off. But I do
[51:23] think that there is an opportunity to
[51:25] gain support if you speak positively
[51:27] about Bitcoin.
[51:29] But unfortunately they painted
[51:31] themselves into a corner because
[51:34] if they talk about positively about
[51:36] Bitcoin they will gain some support but
[51:38] they might lose some support too because
[51:40] the people who exist who are voters in
[51:42] the real world who are um low
[51:45] information about Bitcoin they don't
[51:47] like it. And so if if you've only spent
[51:50] 20 minutes learning about Bitcoin and
[51:53] you think you understand it, then you're
[51:55] probably not going to like it and you're
[51:56] gonna not be happy with a politician who
[51:59] says that they do. So I do think that
[52:01] there it is a very interesting and
[52:03] dynamic situation. It's not just a a
[52:06] like gain it, right? Like I think
[52:07] Republicans have already were the first
[52:10] movers on this. They get to have all of
[52:12] the pro- Bitcoin people because they say
[52:15] nice Bitcoin things and everyone who
[52:17] hates Bitcoin is already on the other
[52:19] side anyway. So, it doesn't really hurt
[52:20] them. Democrats do need to be careful
[52:23] about this idea. Well, how do I talk
[52:25] about Bitcoin? How do I come out in
[52:28] support of it? And this is a important
[52:30] conversation to have to say we need to
[52:31] re-educate people about Bitcoin and not
[52:34] just say, well, it's crypto bros trying
[52:36] to get rich, you know, whatever. you
[52:38] need to talk about it's anti- big bank.
[52:41] It's, you know, more inclusive. It's
[52:43] better for the environment. It helps
[52:44] people, you know, who are victims of
[52:46] violence flee uh a a violent household
[52:50] or a violent country, whatever it is,
[52:52] right? Like it helps people who are
[52:54] getting deported right now illegally to
[52:57] uh have remittances sent back to them
[53:00] crossborder, low fees, uncensorable,
[53:03] unconfiscable. Like Bitcoin does all of
[53:05] these pro-social things. So, I think bit
[53:07] like Democrats have an opportunity to
[53:10] step in, but they can't just be this
[53:12] mindless like yes, Bitcoin, uh, give us
[53:15] your votes and give us your money. They
[53:17] have to be much more nuanced because the
[53:18] Republicans got all of the sort of
[53:21] unthinking, yes, Bitcoin, if you're
[53:23] going to say good things about Bitcoin,
[53:25] I'm going to vote for you. Those votes
[53:27] have already been sucked up. What we
[53:28] need to do is re-educate the populace
[53:30] and say, here are the pro-social things
[53:32] that Bitcoin does, and we're going to
[53:34] actually do them. We're not going to
[53:35] just talk about Bitcoin and then enrich
[53:37] ourselves with crypto scams. We're going
[53:39] to actually do the good things that
[53:40] Bitcoin does. And Democrats have an
[53:42] opportunity and I would love for to see
[53:44] them step into that opportunity and
[53:46] actually take it on. And we'll, you
[53:48] know, for now it's to be determined. But
[53:50] I think that's a real opportunity for
[53:52] them. I see a a presidential election in
[53:56] what would it be 2028 I think is the
[53:58] next one. Um where both candidates kind
[54:01] of fight on like who is the more true
[54:03] Bitcoin? total against that would that
[54:06] would be amazing right so I think that
[54:08] you know one of the politicians that I
[54:10] spoke to on the Bitcoin stage last year
[54:13] his named Ro Kana who's a representative
[54:15] from California and I don't have any
[54:17] inside information but I don't think
[54:19] anybody would be surprised if he wanted
[54:21] to run for president in 2028 or maybe
[54:24] 2032 I don't know um but he he sees the
[54:28] power of Bitcoin he's he understands
[54:29] that it can make the world a better
[54:31] place now he he still has some education
[54:32] to do and all that, but he was on stage
[54:35] at the Bitcoin conference the same day
[54:36] that Trump was on stage at the Bitcoin
[54:38] conference. And so in the next
[54:40] presidential election, like I absolutely
[54:42] there's a possibility that say, well,
[54:45] you say you're on Bitcoin, uh, but
[54:47] you're actually a crypto scammer and I'm
[54:49] the true Bitcoiner and here's how I'm
[54:51] going to make the world a better place.
[54:52] I think that that would be amazing. I
[54:54] don't know that that's if that's likely,
[54:56] but it's certainly possible. Um, and I
[54:58] would love to see that happen.
[55:00] I think it's also important what you do
[55:01] because uh I think it hurts Bitcoin in
[55:04] the public perception if it's just on
[55:07] one aisle and as we discussed it's
[55:10] definitely not balanced. Uh the the loud
[55:13] voices are now on the we al always talk
[55:15] about America but like 50% of my viewers
[55:18] are in America even though I'm not um
[55:21] the 50 like the biggest volume of like
[55:24] who to speak to and stuff like that is
[55:26] happening on the Republican side. So
[55:28] what happens is yeah you are for Bitcoin
[55:30] and obviously all all of the sudden you
[55:33] are Republican like in the public eye
[55:35] you're like oh I like Bitcoin and that's
[55:37] why I'm a Republican. No like that it's
[55:39] it's it's the same thing with with with
[55:42] Tesla owners. I don't know if this it's
[55:44] like just because you have a Tesla
[55:46] you're not necessarily in support of
[55:48] Elon Musk. Um it can happen probably
[55:51] most of them are but like it's it's not
[55:54] necessarily the the same case. Maybe
[55:55] you're just like uh in favor of electric
[55:58] cars and you want to help the planet or
[55:59] like whatever you you want to do. Um I
[56:02] I'll just say I'm I'm a Bitcoiner and
[56:04] not a Republican. I also own a Tesla
[56:06] because I care about electric cars and
[56:08] want to help the planet and I don't
[56:10] support Elon Musk. So, I feel like I'm
[56:13] I'm the perfect case study and and I
[56:15] think that that is sort of the point
[56:18] behind writing the book and and titling
[56:20] it the way that I did and to say a
[56:22] progressive case for Bitcoin is to say
[56:25] this exists. This is not just a
[56:26] Republican right-wing thing. Like,
[56:30] here's an easy to you can read my book
[56:32] on on one airplane trip, right? Like if
[56:34] you're coming back from Vegas for
[56:36] example and you're trying to fly back to
[56:37] Europe, you can read my book in one in
[56:39] one airplane trip and it's just a first
[56:42] touch point for people to understand, oh
[56:44] this isn't just about Republicans or
[56:46] crypto bros getting themselves rich. You
[56:48] know, I don't talk about the Bitcoin
[56:49] price at all in the in the entire book,
[56:52] you know, like I don't talk about the
[56:53] fact that if you buy Bitcoin, you're
[56:55] going to be better off financially, you
[56:56] know, four years. I just talk about the
[56:59] the things that we like progressives
[57:01] really care about. So, I feel like
[57:02] that's the hope is to say, "Oh, this
[57:04] isn't just a Republican thing." Like,
[57:06] anybody can get into this and it's going
[57:08] to sort of serve purposes that they care
[57:10] about. Um, and so that I think that
[57:12] that's the hope and that's why I've
[57:14] stuck it out because it's not always the
[57:17] it can feel kind of lonely sometimes to
[57:19] be in the Bitcoin space and to be a
[57:20] progressive and to know who all loud
[57:22] voices are saying and what they're
[57:24] saying about me. Um, but that's why I'm
[57:26] sticking it out because I think it's
[57:27] important work. it it's very important
[57:30] and uh it's
[57:33] I think there's more progressive in in
[57:36] the Bitcoin community than we think.
[57:37] It's the same the same is true with
[57:40] plant-based people. I think there are
[57:42] more plant-based eaters in the Bitcoin
[57:45] space than you might think. Um, every
[57:48] because I made videos for example with
[57:51] uh with Nico from Simply Bitcoin with
[57:53] other people where we were very
[57:55] pro-Trump like the guest is very
[57:58] proTrump. Then I get a lot of comments
[58:00] of like, hey, like I really hate Trump,
[58:02] but I'm a Bitcoiner. Like I get those
[58:04] comments. I see the volume of people.
[58:07] Uh, and the same is true. I had Matthew
[58:10] Luziak on that wrote that the fear food
[58:14] or something like with cyberine
[58:16] something like that. Um and and he was
[58:20] making the case for like carnivore and
[58:22] and not eating plant-based and stuff
[58:24] like that. So and then there are a lot a
[58:26] lot of people coming out, oh I'm a we a
[58:28] plant-based eater. Like I I love Bitcoin
[58:30] and I love eating plant-based. It's
[58:32] really good for my body and like so it
[58:34] it's it's it's it's funny how Bitcoin is
[58:38] a mirror and just because like you are
[58:41] maybe a carnivore maybe maybe you are uh
[58:44] a conservative like you you support
[58:47] Trump like you you like support all
[58:50] those things and then you're like hey
[58:52] I'm also Bitcoiner so I think all other
[58:56] bitcoin also has to be like that. No,
[58:59] like Bitcoin is Bitcoin is neutral.
[59:00] Bitcoin is nothing. Bitcoin is anything
[59:02] like you want to be and it's just a like
[59:05] if if you think Bitcoin has to be like
[59:07] that then you portraying your selfimage
[59:10] on Bitcoin and mirroring that out which
[59:12] is not true. So it's a it's really
[59:15] interesting um the community aspect of
[59:17] of that. I I agree with you and I think
[59:20] the loudest voices are the carnivores or
[59:22] you know like all of that stuff. But I I
[59:24] do think that your comments on your
[59:27] YouTube videos are probably very
[59:28] telling, right? Like if if somebody's
[59:30] watching right now like, "Hey, I'm a
[59:32] plant-based. I'm into the environment.
[59:34] Like I'm into Bitcoin." Like that's or
[59:37] like maybe I'm Bitcoin curious, but I
[59:39] have all of these other priorities and
[59:41] things I care about like that. Like I
[59:43] wrote my book for you like that person,
[59:45] right? To say like, "Oh, I'm I'm hearing
[59:48] all of these things to be a Bitcoiner. I
[59:50] have to be, you know, into carnivore
[59:52] diet." Well, that's not true. Um, and so
[59:55] like that's I think that's why I tried
[59:56] to write the book and why, you know,
[59:58] like we have this new institution called
[60:00] the Bitcoin um the progressive
[60:02] Bitcoiner. It's the nonprofit I
[60:03] mentioned earlier. Like there's a lot of
[60:05] resources now that are available for
[60:07] people who are into that kind of thing.
[60:09] Um or who who even if they themselves
[60:12] maybe they're a carnivore but they have
[60:14] a friend or a family member who isn't
[60:16] and they don't want to turn them off
[60:18] with like this extreme rhetoric. Lyn,
[60:20] I'm trying to provide a resource for
[60:21] people um to learn about Bitcoin without
[60:24] that extreme predicate uh rhetoric that
[60:26] actually speaks a language that they
[60:28] speak.
[60:30] Yeah. No, I support this u because I
[60:32] think there's something like feared
[60:33] food, but it's not plant-based or
[60:36] carnivore. It's the processed food.
[60:38] Yeah. Yeah. Like sometimes it's just
[60:41] like misguided
[60:43] somehow. I I I have to I think I I
[60:45] really want to uh make a plant-based
[60:48] versus carnivore debate on my channel
[60:50] because I think it's a fun topic
[60:52] completely outside of Bitcoin. Has
[60:54] literally nothing to do with Bitcoin. Uh
[60:56] it
[60:58] outside of like indirectly touching with
[60:59] money. Uh it's it's it's a it would be a
[61:02] fun idea. What do you think is the are
[61:05] you plant-based? Uh I am. And yeah, I'll
[61:08] just say like I think that you're right.
[61:10] It's it's the the distinction shouldn't
[61:12] be carnivore versus plant-based. I think
[61:13] it's it's literally sort of a pro you
[61:16] can be a vegan and plant-based and
[61:18] absolutely be uh eat junk food that's
[61:21] processed all the time, right? And you
[61:23] know, it depends on how busy and
[61:25] stressed I am. I fall into that. Even
[61:26] though I'm plant-based, I'm eating
[61:28] processed junk. Um and the same thing is
[61:30] true no matter what diet you have. So, I
[61:32] feel like if you're really clean vegan
[61:33] and you're just eating plant, you know,
[61:35] vegetables, plants, and you know,
[61:38] cooking your food in in in very clean
[61:40] ways that aren't processed, I think
[61:41] you're going to be a healthy person. And
[61:43] I think that you can be a healthy person
[61:44] if you have an omnivore diet also, and
[61:47] you're not having processed food. So,
[61:49] like I like I'm I am plant-based, but
[61:51] I'm not pro like promoting it in terms
[61:54] of everybody should be. I just think
[61:55] that like you should try to just be a
[61:56] healthy person and eat whole foods. Um,
[61:59] and so for me, my body appreciates and I
[62:02] actually do better if I'm a plant-based
[62:04] person. Um, but that's not I'm not
[62:07] suggesting that for everybody. Yeah. Me
[62:10] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[62:10] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[62:10] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[62:10] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[62:10] me me me me me me me me ne me me me me
[62:11] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[62:11] me me me me me me me me me me me me me
[62:11] me me me me me me me me me me ne ne e
[62:11] neither. I actually eat both and uh I'
[62:14] I'm probably mostly plant-based,
[62:16] honestly. Uh I think a lot of people
[62:19] don't know that. They just assume that I
[62:20] eat a steak a day and I and a lot and I
[62:23] love steak. I like I had a steak in
[62:25] Vegas and and I love eating I love
[62:28] eating that but honestly my body feels
[62:30] better after plant-based and and when I
[62:32] eat clean b clean clean plant-based but
[62:34] I really have to do my research on on
[62:36] that topic. I haven't haven't gone down
[62:38] deep the rabbit hole of like food. Uh
[62:42] but but yeah, it's it's an interesting
[62:43] it's interesting how Bitcoin kind of
[62:46] forces you almost to get down those
[62:48] rabbit holes even though like like you
[62:51] learn about money and then wait you're
[62:53] talking about food like Yeah. Yeah.
[62:55] Yeah. And and I think that's fine,
[62:57] right? Because money does touch on
[62:58] everything, right? And so like the idea
[63:00] that like our broken money system is
[63:02] probably contributing to like huge
[63:04] factory farms where you know like it's
[63:07] we're not producing healthful food
[63:09] anymore for our people like that is tied
[63:11] to the money system and I feel like you
[63:13] know I'm not an expert on on that stuff
[63:15] but I do think that it's it is connected
[63:17] and and Bitcoin is perfect for lifelong
[63:20] learners right so if I'm going to like
[63:22] leave with something it's like Bitcoin
[63:24] probably affects something that you care
[63:26] about and if you consider yourself a
[63:28] lifelong learner then you're going to
[63:29] keep learning. If you're if you find
[63:31] yourself into Bitcoin, you're going to
[63:32] keep learning the rest of your life for
[63:34] sure. Do you think um
[63:38] how do you see the connection between AI
[63:41] and and Bitcoin? Because I think AI is
[63:44] probably the biggest thing for me
[63:47] happening outside of Bitcoin. Like
[63:49] Bitcoin is revolutioning revolutioning
[63:51] the money which is obviously the biggest
[63:52] thing like which touches everything. But
[63:55] AI also has a unique capability and
[63:58] opportunity to completely change what we
[64:01] do on a daily basis. How do you look?
[64:03] How do you look at that? Um, I I think
[64:05] it's hard to make a prediction because
[64:07] AI changes so quickly. Um, and its
[64:10] capabilities and what it's doing. Um,
[64:12] yeah, human beings just are not very
[64:14] good at thinking in exponential terms. I
[64:16] think that we're we think in linear
[64:18] terms. So it's really hard for us to
[64:20] predict what's going to be happening six
[64:22] months or 18 months from now in terms of
[64:24] AI. So it's hard to make a prediction.
[64:26] What what I can say is that Bitcoin has
[64:29] given me a lens through which to look at
[64:31] like technological advancements and
[64:33] what's happened in the past is um even
[64:36] though we have a deflationary technology
[64:39] situation and things are getting cheaper
[64:41] to produce and easier to produce and
[64:44] transport uh what we have seen you know
[64:46] Jeff Booth talks about this a lot is
[64:48] like all of the all of those gains are
[64:50] flowing to the top and so you know your
[64:54] food isn't any cheaper um your health
[64:56] care isn't any cheaper even though it's
[64:59] cheaper to produce and transport and and
[65:01] like you know educate people and all of
[65:03] those things right everything should be
[65:04] getting cheaper but it isn't some things
[65:06] are like the phones and the TVs yes
[65:08] they're getting cheaper but everything
[65:09] else is getting more expensive and those
[65:12] gains are flowing to the top right the
[65:13] people that own the companies the people
[65:15] that sort of sit on top of the system
[65:17] are all gaining benefit from that and so
[65:20] that Bitcoin allowed me to see that
[65:23] through that lens and I think that I I
[65:26] try to think about AI in the same way,
[65:29] right? Like there's a version of AI that
[65:31] says, oh, all of these jobs that we used
[65:34] to have to do by hand and all of these
[65:36] things that uh we used to spend time and
[65:39] energy doing, we don't have to do those
[65:40] anymore. And there's a version of that
[65:43] says, well, that means everybody can
[65:44] work less and they can sort of have more
[65:47] leisure time and they can be more
[65:48] relaxed and and all of these things. And
[65:51] I just don't see that as the natural way
[65:53] of it happening. I think all of those,
[65:56] you know, those people get laid off and
[65:57] the gains and the sort of the
[65:59] efficiencies and the more money and the
[66:01] profit all flow to the top. And so,
[66:03] Bitcoin has given me an opportunity to
[66:06] appreciate that that's the most likely
[66:07] thing to happen because when we look at
[66:10] the current financial system, that's
[66:12] what we see happening. And so maybe
[66:14] Bitcoin is sort of a last, you know, a
[66:17] lastditch defense against uh all of the
[66:20] gains and benefits and and flowing to
[66:22] the top. I think the other lens that
[66:25] Bitcoin provides is understanding that
[66:27] AI can be a powerful tool to fight
[66:29] against corruption and authoritarian
[66:31] regimes and dictators. And it's also a
[66:33] very powerful tool for dictators and
[66:35] authoritarian regimes to surveil people.
[66:38] And so just to be aware of the fact that
[66:41] the people who are in power now, they
[66:43] want to remain in power
[66:45] um and they want to control their
[66:47] population. All of a sudden, artificial
[66:50] intelligence has become this very
[66:52] powerful tool of face recognition and
[66:54] pattern detection and tracking and
[66:56] surveillance uh in order to do that. And
[66:58] we need to be aware of that and and find
[67:00] ways to fight against it. So, um I don't
[67:03] see like I don't I'm not one of those
[67:05] people like oh because the AI is so
[67:07] smart it's going to want to buy all the
[67:09] Bitcoin and use Bitcoin. I I think that
[67:11] Bitcoin gives me a lens to look at this
[67:13] new technology and gives me sort of
[67:16] cautionary tales like what should we
[67:18] what should we be worried about with AI
[67:21] and what are the ways it could help and
[67:23] what are the things that would be a
[67:25] hurdle to that help. Um so I think
[67:27] that's the connection that I see but
[67:29] it's hard to make a prediction like um
[67:31] so you know like I would hate to to even
[67:34] be asked like what do you think AI is
[67:36] going to be doing in 18 months? It's
[67:38] it's really just hard to comprehend. Um,
[67:40] so I think that's that's the best I can
[67:43] do in terms of the connection between
[67:44] those two things. Yeah. It's it's it's
[67:47] unbelievable
[67:49] how we got from an AI development last
[67:53] year to this year. Oh yeah. I I it's
[67:56] it's it's completely different. And then
[67:58] you go back five years and you're like
[68:00] there wasn't even like we didn't even
[68:03] talk about AI. like nobody cared about
[68:05] AI back then because like it was just
[68:08] like something nerds and people that
[68:10] really got into this technology was
[68:12] interested in but with the introduction
[68:14] of chat GPD I think that was like really
[68:16] the inflection point where people all of
[68:18] a sudden had something to interact with
[68:19] AI just like this this all of the sudden
[68:23] there's like Google like the the Google
[68:25] moment for the internet uh so that was
[68:29] really interesting uh to see how AI is
[68:33] all of the sudden coming into the
[68:34] mainstream and now I rely on it every
[68:37] single day. like I couldn't do the
[68:39] podcast without the fasc and and you
[68:42] know just look like my wife owns a
[68:44] business and she was at a point where
[68:46] she needed to hire somebody but couldn't
[68:48] quite afford it because you know like
[68:50] the income stream didn't you know and
[68:52] and like you know truth be told like
[68:55] without AI like AI was what enabled her
[68:58] to like run her business when she could
[69:00] she needed to add another person to her
[69:02] payroll but could probably only afford
[69:04] like half a person you know what I mean
[69:06] and so like AI like that every day she's
[69:09] probably using AI to help her with some
[69:10] sort of task or or brainstorm an idea.
[69:13] Um, you know, and I and my kids are
[69:16] using it in in my classroom, right? So,
[69:18] they're not using it to like cheat on
[69:20] their homework. Well, they might be, but
[69:22] like I see them using AI to say, "Oh,
[69:25] we're learning this topic in class. You
[69:27] know, my teacher just gave me a couple
[69:29] of examples. Can you create four more
[69:32] examples for me that are about this
[69:33] topic?" And and the thing is producing
[69:35] like perfectly crafted calculus problems
[69:38] with solutions that the kids can check
[69:40] themselves. So they're using it
[69:41] responsibly. It's what a powerful tool.
[69:44] It's not something I ever had, right?
[69:45] Like I had a textbook and whatever
[69:47] questions were listed in the textbook is
[69:48] what I had access to. There's no
[69:50] internet even. Well, there might have
[69:52] been internet but not for somebody but I
[69:54] wasn't nerdy enough at the time. Wasn't
[69:56] mainstream enough. So like I'm learning
[69:58] calculus with like the four problems
[70:00] that are in the book and these kids can
[70:02] learn calculus with an infinite number
[70:04] of examples at their fingertips
[70:06] immediately. So like it's powerful
[70:08] across the board. Um and and all of
[70:11] those things couldn't have happened a
[70:13] year ago as well as they do now. And so
[70:16] knowing what's going to be um you know
[70:18] on the horizon is is even harder. It's
[70:20] it's hard to predict. Absolutely. Um I
[70:24] have one question to ask each and every
[70:25] one of my guests and the question is
[70:27] what can we learn from you besides
[70:29] Bitcoin?
[70:31] Um that's a great uh that's a great
[70:35] question. So not Bitcoin related.
[70:38] Um I uh
[70:43] you know what I I am a self-taught
[70:46] computer scientist coder right? So I'm
[70:48] I'm a math guy. Um, but I years ago
[70:52] before AI or anything like that, um, I
[70:55] learned how to just sort of self-taught
[70:57] and I had a couple of friends that
[70:58] helped me. So, I'm not an expert. I'm
[71:00] not like a coder or a hack or anything,
[71:02] but like I really found it interesting
[71:03] to learn about different algorithms and
[71:05] things like that. So, um, this isn't
[71:08] maybe this isn't the best answer, but I
[71:10] would say that I'm fascinated by, um,
[71:14] like I'm I'm always trying to like have
[71:16] my my pet projects create programs that
[71:19] will play games against me, like the
[71:22] like that kind of AI where it's like
[71:23] you'll play chess or play Connect 4
[71:26] against me. And one of the coolest
[71:28] algorithms that I started learning about
[71:29] was called the Monte Carlo tree search
[71:32] method. Um, and you know, for people who
[71:35] know about this, it's it's going to be
[71:37] pretty basic, but for people who have
[71:38] never heard about it, it's amazing. Um,
[71:40] you can train a a system to play a game
[71:44] uh against you without telling it the
[71:46] rules or giving it any sort of input
[71:48] like this is a good position in chess,
[71:50] this is a bad position in chess. It
[71:52] create it uses no human knowledge about
[71:54] the game, just like uh is this a win
[71:57] state or a lose state. And so it's
[71:58] fascinating uh kind of thing. So, it
[72:00] kind of um I I fell in love with that
[72:03] and started programming a bunch of
[72:04] different games and it was it's very
[72:06] basic and very self-taught and very like
[72:08] in my own garage kind of thing. Um but
[72:11] it's one of the things I really uh find
[72:13] interesting and so I do projects like
[72:14] that. But Monte Carlo research method
[72:17] was one of the things that was like sort
[72:18] of a light bulb for me like oh I can
[72:20] program a chess a computer to play chess
[72:22] without telling it what's a good
[72:24] position or a bad position. That's kind
[72:25] of neat. So um I would say look into
[72:27] that. That's kind of a cool thing.
[72:30] I I had this is super interesting
[72:32] because uh when I I was in technical
[72:37] school. It was now five 6 years ago that
[72:41] I graduated from school and at the end
[72:43] of the school you had to do some project
[72:46] and a colleague of mine had an EI
[72:48] project and they used the same exact
[72:51] algorithm that you just uh say that I
[72:53] cannot even repeat it but I remember
[72:55] that name from there and they made me
[72:59] compete with that because I was the best
[73:01] fox and geese player. Did you do you
[73:03] know that game? I don't I don't
[73:06] um it it's it's that game. It's like you
[73:09] have two foxes and a bunch of gizers and
[73:12] the the the objective for the geese is
[73:15] to get all the to get nine geesees in
[73:18] that in there without foxes and the
[73:21] foxes want to keep them out. like it's
[73:23] it's like very easy to explain and I was
[73:26] super good in that because I always
[73:28] played it as a as a small child with my
[73:30] grandma and uh this game uh they tried
[73:35] to to do with me because it's like way
[73:38] easier than chess like like that you can
[73:41] master this in two days if you really
[73:44] with that chess you cannot master in two
[73:47] days it's just too complicated but and
[73:49] they tried it with that and I beat it.
[73:51] Oh no,
[73:53] they they did they did not succeed
[73:56] because not like you have to train it
[73:58] and you have to have it on the computer
[73:59] running. So did not had enough time to
[74:01] let it run. Um but that's how I know
[74:04] about that. It's the only time I I I
[74:06] really heard about that. So like yeah,
[74:08] Fox and Geese if if I guess I'm going to
[74:10] look I'm going to look into it because
[74:11] it seems like a perfect little thing
[74:12] that you can code. Um and I and I feel
[74:15] like I could probably make a version
[74:16] that you can't beat. Um,
[74:20] and I think it's it's to me and I will
[74:22] uh prove it differently. So I I think
[74:25] it's a fascinating thing when I create
[74:27] like I like I started with connect four
[74:30] um you know you drop the checkers in and
[74:32] you got to get four in a row. And it's
[74:34] such a frustrating thing to be beaten by
[74:37] a computer but then to realize that you
[74:39] programmed the thing that is beating
[74:41] you. It's kind of like this weird like
[74:43] transcendental moment where you're like,
[74:45] "Oh, wow." Like I'm beating myself but
[74:47] with a machine. You know what I mean?
[74:49] It's kind of cool. Um, so yeah, I think
[74:51] that that's I mean all that stuff is
[74:53] very interesting. I'm kind of nerdy like
[74:54] that, but um yeah, cool. Fox and Geese.
[74:57] I'm going to look into it. I've never
[74:58] seen it before, so I'm going to learn
[74:59] about it. It's a It's a super fun game,
[75:02] at least for me, because uh every time I
[75:04] play with another human being, I win. Is
[75:07] that right? All right. So, all right.
[75:09] Challenge accepted. I'm going to look
[75:11] into it, see what I can do.
[75:14] Next podcast episode, we're playing
[75:15] while we're speaking. Yes, exactly. It's
[75:18] al it's also a little It's also shorter,
[75:20] you know, like chess can be a very long
[75:22] game, but geese is like usually after 10
[75:25] 20 minutes. Yeah. But we have an endine
[75:27] in the podcast where the previous guest
[75:29] is asking a question for the next guest
[75:30] without knowing who the next guest
[75:32] actually is. And the previous ask you
[75:34] the question, uh, what do you think
[75:37] Bitcoiners are getting wrong right now?
[75:39] Oo. Um, I think I I might have asked
[75:43] this question. Um, I I think that um I'm
[75:46] very highly skeptical of
[75:51] companies that are being created for the
[75:53] sole purpose of having a Bitcoin
[75:55] treasury.
[75:56] I think that if you're a corporation
[75:58] that's providing a profitable good or
[76:00] service and you want to take some of the
[76:02] profits and buy Bitcoin with it and
[76:03] create a treasury for Bitcoin, that's
[76:05] absolutely something that you should do
[76:06] and it's a good idea. Um, that's what I
[76:09] do on a personal level. Um, right? Like
[76:12] I provide a good and service, I get paid
[76:13] and and some of the profits from that uh
[76:16] go into Bitcoin. Um, but I don't like
[76:20] I shouldn't say I don't like it. I'm
[76:22] worried that the idea of of issue like
[76:24] creating a company that's just going to
[76:26] issue debt to buy Bitcoin has a lot of
[76:30] um risk involved. And if we just sort of
[76:33] blind and we think number goes up all
[76:35] the time and it's not volatile and it
[76:37] doesn't go down sometimes and all of the
[76:39] sort of models are based on well I can
[76:42] survive a 50% draw down or whatever. I
[76:46] just think it's going to blow up. You
[76:48] know I think that it's um I think it's
[76:51] going to become it has a potential to
[76:53] become a real bad mess. So, I think
[76:55] that's what some Bitcoiners are getting
[76:58] wrong right now is sort of jumping on
[76:59] this bandwagon that um you know because
[77:02] Michael Sailor did it now a bunch of
[77:04] other companies are going to do it. I
[77:06] think that we just need to be more
[77:07] cautious and kind of uh learn from
[77:09] history and realizing that like trying
[77:12] to create infinite money by issuing debt
[77:14] and doing complicated financial
[77:16] instruments is sort of what the old
[77:18] system was doing and it didn't work
[77:20] well. So we don't need to be doing it as
[77:22] Bitcoiners and and that's my take on
[77:24] that. Yeah, I think uh 21 Capitalist is
[77:27] is is doing that but other
[77:30] like most like all the other companies
[77:32] that I know they are usually having some
[77:34] business like semi-cientific metanet and
[77:37] and stuff like that. 21 Capital is the
[77:39] only one that I know that that really
[77:41] and that was a weird like like big
[77:45] companies create their own company just
[77:48] for the purpose to have to to acquire
[77:52] Bitcoin but like where's the money
[77:55] coming from and like how is it it's
[77:57] getting there's a lot of question in my
[77:59] mind then also like Jack Mullers at the
[78:01] top is interesting um with with the
[78:05] strike I think Jack Muller's doing great
[78:07] work with Strike and I use Strike every
[78:09] day and I think it's a great service and
[78:12] it's it's profitable and um you know I
[78:15] think that's all of that's good for
[78:17] Bitcoin. Um and sort of creating I don't
[78:20] I guess I'm not saying it's bad. I'm
[78:22] just saying that Bitcoiners should be
[78:24] cautious about the idea of creating a
[78:26] company uh that you know is doing this
[78:29] other sort of fiat-minded stuff in my
[78:31] opinion. Um and and there's you know
[78:34] like I said if you're providing a good
[78:35] service and making a profit then
[78:37] absolutely invest in Bitcoin uh with
[78:39] that profit. But um you know and I think
[78:41] 21 Capital is the most famous example
[78:44] but there's a lot of talk about these
[78:45] other Bitcoin treasury companies that
[78:46] are happening now. Um and you know I
[78:49] think Micro Strategy like you could
[78:51] probably make an argument like you know
[78:53] their entire business model now is just
[78:54] Bitcoin you know in terms of like what
[78:57] their stock is and all of that. So it's
[78:58] just a proxy and exposure to Bitcoin. um
[79:01] and they're releasing all these
[79:03] complicated financial instruments in
[79:05] order to obtain more Bitcoin. Like I
[79:06] don't have I don't have any ill will
[79:08] towards Michael Sailor. I think he's
[79:10] he's a great ambassador for Bitcoin most
[79:12] of the time. But um I just think that
[79:15] Bitcoiners should probably be more
[79:17] cautious than they are now as opposed to
[79:18] just sort of blindly thinking that if
[79:20] Michael Sailor does it then it's good
[79:22] and everybody should be doing it. I
[79:24] think we need a little bit more
[79:25] introspection than that.
[79:28] Absolutely. Um and we have come already
[79:30] kind of to the to the end of it. Thank
[79:33] you so much Jason for for for being on.
[79:36] Um before I let you go, where can people
[79:38] find you, ask your questions, reach out
[79:39] to you? Yeah. So um you can find me on
[79:42] Twitter cjason is uh my handle and my
[79:46] website for the book is
[79:48] bitcoinprogressive.com.
[79:50] So you can see uh where to buy the book
[79:52] or see me do uh interviews talking about
[79:54] Bitcoin like this one. Um, and so those
[79:57] those are the best ways to reach out to
[79:59] me and to be in touch. My DMs are open.
[80:01] Always happy to engage with people with
[80:03] in good faith and uh educate people
[80:05] about Bitcoin. Awesome. Thank you so
[80:07] much, Jason. Also, thank you so much for
[80:09] everyone that is watching and listening
[80:11] for joining us today. As always, I'll be
[80:13] back tomorrow with another episode.
[80:14] Bye-bye.
