[00:00] Without the policy in place, I would
[00:02] never be 86% allocated. Not a chance. No
[00:06] way. I can buy Bitcoin instant. I mean,
[00:08] like instant. When I go to sell
[00:10] property, it takes me 90 days to sell
[00:12] it. I actually think that we need to
[00:14] start giving to the lobbyists like like
[00:17] I like Coinbase because Coinbase fought
[00:19] the SEC. Now, when they're not talking
[00:21] about price, we have made a lot of
[00:23] progress. Now, Bitcoin is already
[00:25] running down the racetrack and beating
[00:26] everyone. It's not like we're still
[00:28] testing. This is a 16-year-old super
[00:31] athlete that has never lost an Olympic
[00:34] champion result and he's been attacked
[00:37] by everybody. He is getting stronger.
[00:39] So, if I can contract time, I actually
[00:42] raise lighten my whole load and I become
[00:45] more well. I was able to observe the
[00:47] people not not the price. I didn't care
[00:49] about the price. high quality people. I
[00:51] mean, really brilliant people that I
[00:53] like hanging out with and they were
[00:55] their characteristics are a lot like
[00:57] mine. But when you stick this much
[00:59] intelligence into an industry, it always
[01:02] explodes. We're in stage one. We've not
[01:05] left the atmosphere yet.
[01:10] Good. We are live. It's my first ever
[01:13] live stream. I'm so glad to do it with
[01:14] you. Well done. I'm glad to be the guy.
[01:16] Absolutely. Um, I want to first get the
[01:19] the w of the conference because we
[01:20] always said Bitcoin 2095 in Las Vegas. I
[01:23] think it's the biggest Bitcoin
[01:24] conference ever. It's probably the
[01:25] biggest one. Like, it's a really huge
[01:27] conference. I think 35,000 uh uh people.
[01:30] How do you like it so far? It's awesome.
[01:32] It's awesome. And it's in a really good
[01:34] location. Like I like the way Vegas was
[01:37] built to do these conventions. And
[01:39] Bitcoin now this will be the smallest
[01:41] convention in Bitcoin's history next
[01:43] year. Like this thing is going to be so
[01:46] big next year. You have every major bank
[01:48] here showing their toes. It will be
[01:52] huge. I I watched the uh the JD Van
[01:55] presentation. Did you watch? I have not
[01:57] got a chance to see that one. He he
[02:00] talked about something interesting. He
[02:01] talked about advice to to Bitcoiners at
[02:04] the end of the speech and it was
[02:06] interesting for me because he said like
[02:08] don't make this mistake of ignoring
[02:10] politics. How do you think um how much
[02:14] pay attention should someone and Bitcoin
[02:16] pay attention to politics? How important
[02:18] is this? Well, I think when you have a
[02:20] uh look, we we we have an administration
[02:23] that is extremely positive,
[02:27] the digitization of our world. They see
[02:29] the opportunity.
[02:31] You have 37 besides Trump, you have 37
[02:34] year old average age uh between David
[02:38] Sachs and
[02:40] uh Bessant and JD Vance. I mean, you
[02:44] want I want the politicians to be
[02:46] involved. That's why I gave Trump 12.8
[02:50] in Nashville. People thought I was
[02:52] crazy, but and quite frankly, if I can
[02:55] just take one second or 30 seconds to I
[02:58] have a a bit of a bone to pick with the
[03:01] old
[03:03] OG Bitcoiners
[03:06] who have been and I understand why you
[03:08] would be remiss to want to support
[03:11] politics, but I actually think that we
[03:14] need to start giving to the lobbyists
[03:17] and who whatever lobbyist you like, but
[03:20] I am not doing the work and like like I
[03:23] like Coinbase because Coinbase fought
[03:25] the SEC
[03:27] and so it it decentralization is awesome
[03:31] but in order to get political movement
[03:34] we're fighting some of the largest
[03:35] corporations on the planet and unless we
[03:38] act as a centralized body to support
[03:41] some political process I'm afraid that
[03:45] the Visas Mastercards JP Morgans and the
[03:49] midtier banking system is sucking the
[03:52] life out of Joe Consumer. They don't
[03:54] suck anything out of it. But out of Joe
[03:57] Regular, they're extorting these
[04:00] companies because they're grossly
[04:01] inefficient.
[04:03] And so if they have lobby dollars, then
[04:07] crypto industry, Bitcoin needs a
[04:10] centralized supporting lobby team. And
[04:12] that's why I think we're making the
[04:14] progress we're making because the first
[04:16] dono was $25 million Trump. and it got
[04:19] his attention and we should want to get
[04:22] people's attention. We are the greatest
[04:24] industry in the world. We got to start
[04:26] acting like it. I love that. It's really
[04:30] important. So like it's it's the future
[04:33] of it, right? You're literally this is
[04:35] an insurance policy. I'm investing in
[04:38] the future of Bitcoin by laying out the
[04:41] political rails and and that is like
[04:44] that is gets us to sustainability.
[04:46] Policy is really really important. I
[04:48] know everybody thinks Nia is a trader
[04:50] and a and a risk taker, but without the
[04:53] policy in place, I would never be 86%
[04:56] allocated. Not a chance. No way. In in
[05:00] many ways, Bitcoin is the most like the
[05:02] the least riskiest things you can do
[05:04] right now. At least for me, how I see
[05:06] it. But do you see it as risk still? I
[05:10] see it as riskless like like almost no
[05:14] risk now.
[05:16] Um, I I I see no risk to Bitcoin unless
[05:20] you consider a risk of $5,000 downturn
[05:23] or $10,000 downturn, but $10,000
[05:27] downturns that happen in four days.
[05:31] I don't even I haven't even looked at
[05:32] the price of Bitcoin. What is it? 109, I
[05:35] think. Very interesting, right? Uh I
[05:38] think it's at 107 actually. So, you're
[05:40] 2,000 off. You don't care. I don't care.
[05:44] No one in three days has asked me about
[05:46] the price of Bitcoin at this trade show.
[05:47] That is a big deal. No one's asked me
[05:50] about the price and no one has stated
[05:52] the price. Now, when they're not talking
[05:55] about price, uh we have made a lot of
[05:58] progress, man. Because I remember people
[06:00] walking around just looking at their
[06:01] damn what's happening, what's price is
[06:04] going down. That's not happening
[06:06] anymore. like like I've been I go to
[06:08] some really cool shows and events like
[06:10] this and I was in one in Montana with uh
[06:14] Salt with Scaramucci. He does a great
[06:17] show by the way. U
[06:20] some of the biggest players in the
[06:22] world. Not one mention of price. Oh
[06:25] yeah. They're talking what are we
[06:26] building for five to eight years? I mean
[06:30] City Bank. What are we building for 12
[06:32] years? It's a very different crypto
[06:34] world, man, than when I when you and I
[06:37] came in. It's But is it most of the like
[06:41] the the Oh, I grabbed. Yeah. Um is it
[06:45] most of the high net worth individuals
[06:48] and we and the companies that are price
[06:50] agnostic because you see a lot of retail
[06:53] folks, a lot of people that come into
[06:55] Bitcoin. Uh maybe they have like 0.5
[06:58] Bitcoin, 0.2 Bitcoin. I think the there
[07:01] is like the the price is still a bigger
[07:03] topic. I noticed just like on on on
[07:06] funers and stuff like that if you put
[07:07] the price in I guess there's more
[07:09] attention there. Yeah. Uh but I see the
[07:11] institutions that they really don't care
[07:12] about the price. They're completely
[07:14] agnostic. If it's 50,000 or 150,000 they
[07:17] just buy it. There's a good asset to buy
[07:18] it. Actually don't even think they look
[07:20] at the price. They look at the market
[07:22] cap. two trillion dollar industry.
[07:25] Really, really big institutional players
[07:27] and smart people will be like, well,
[07:30] there hasn't been a $2 trillion industry
[07:33] that has ever failed. In the history of
[07:35] finance, if you get to $2 trillion, you
[07:39] have so much critical mass, you don't
[07:41] fail. And this is why I think Bitcoin at
[07:45] $2 trillion market cap is less risky
[07:49] today than it was when it was a $600
[07:52] million market cap. Because I can't say
[07:55] that about a $600 billion market cap
[07:57] that it doesn't survive. This is why I
[07:59] don't believe XRP, Salana, or Ethereum
[08:03] will ever go on a reserve.
[08:06] Why? Like all you guys were getting
[08:08] jacked up buying XRP and Ethereum
[08:10] thinking it was going to get on a
[08:11] reserve. Their market caps are too
[08:13] small. $600 million $600 billion
[08:17] Ethereum market cap does not allow a
[08:19] pension or much less a government to go
[08:22] I'm going to plow into my reserve into
[08:24] XRP or slot. But Bitcoin where they two
[08:28] trillion dollars and you're seeing this
[08:30] in the policy now we will put digital
[08:33] assets on our balance sheet assuming
[08:36] they have a market cap of exceeding this
[08:40] and that leads you to one product and
[08:43] that is Bitcoin Bitcoin only 2002 two
[08:46] trillion dollars my brother who does
[08:48] real estate $330 trillion worth of real
[08:51] estate his mindset I'm not picking on
[08:54] him but his mindset's going to
[08:56] this industry here, this 330 compared to
[08:59] this tiny little $2 trillion,
[09:02] this two trillion could get wiped out.
[09:05] Now, that's his viewpoint. I look at it
[09:08] very different. This two trillion only
[09:11] gets much bigger and this 330 only gets
[09:14] smaller. Like like to me, I I don't want
[09:18] to be here. I want to buy this and
[09:21] Bitcoin is already running down the
[09:23] racetrack and beating everyone. Like
[09:26] it's not like we're still tested. This
[09:28] is a 16-year-old super athlete that has
[09:31] never
[09:33] lost an Olympic champion result and he's
[09:37] been attacked by everybody. Everybody in
[09:38] their brother and he's still alive. He
[09:41] is getting stronger. You're telling me
[09:43] you would bet against a 16 or 17 year
[09:46] old athlete that's going into rugby and
[09:50] he's competing against guy a veterans
[09:53] that have been around 35 years. He's
[09:55] gonna destroy the 35 year old like like
[09:58] like this is like bet betting against a
[10:02] farce that's never lost to race a one of
[10:05] one breed line like like you could just
[10:08] to the Saudis they'll be like I'm buying
[10:10] that arts right so Bitcoin to me is just
[10:13] a it's never lost a race
[10:17] never lost a race I I feel uh real
[10:20] estate uh is is a really interesting
[10:23] market for Bitcoiners because I've seen
[10:25] I've probably interviewed like 30 real
[10:28] estate people that switched entirely or
[10:32] most of their real estate properties to
[10:34] Bitcoin. I it it's more than gold bucks.
[10:37] It's more than any other industry where
[10:39] I see like all right, I get the same
[10:41] properties but just in a digital realm
[10:44] and I don't have to deal with tenants
[10:46] and all of that physical [ __ ] for for
[10:48] for real estate. It's it's like I I
[10:52] thought first we demonetized gold.
[10:55] maybe those ETF market and stuff like
[10:58] that, but actually real estate is a huge
[11:00] market where financial energy gets
[11:02] sucked into Bitcoin. I I find it
[11:05] fascinating.
[11:07] Yeah, it it makes sense to me that the
[11:09] real estate guys would get it.
[11:12] And I suspect that the guys you're
[11:14] talking about are the big guys are
[11:17] struggling because the big guys have so
[11:20] much of it.
[11:22] So for them, I'll bet you most of your
[11:23] guys are they have individual homes or
[11:25] some apartments, but they're not 40,000.
[11:28] Yeah. The middle and and it's the middle
[11:31] guy. See, I think Bitcoin wakes up
[11:36] people that are
[11:38] feeling more and more gravity. I use the
[11:41] word gravity
[11:43] to be to cover inflation, friction,
[11:48] in and outs, liquidity, all everything
[11:50] friction, right? like takes me 3 days to
[11:53] buy a piece of real estate on a good
[11:56] day. Could take me 90. I can buy Bitcoin
[11:59] instant. I mean like instant. When I go
[12:02] to sell property, it takes me 90 days to
[12:04] sell it. I mean, there's just so the bit
[12:07] the real estate middle tier real estate
[12:09] guys will get this really quickly. And
[12:12] the big guys, I think they will all come
[12:15] into Bitcoin
[12:17] because it's going to elevate their
[12:18] kaggers. It's going to reduce risk and I
[12:22] think the more they do it four years
[12:24] from now my brother will not buy real
[12:26] well I shouldn't say that look he's a
[12:28] big real estate guy like he he has a big
[12:30] big business right
[12:32] but I suspect it's not going to be 15%
[12:34] of the portfolio it's going to you're
[12:36] going to see people change this
[12:38] allocation radically it's also
[12:40] interesting because real estate is
[12:42] really big because of the borrowing
[12:44] against the real estate basically you
[12:46] buy it on dump how do you look at the
[12:48] same thing with Bitcoin
[12:50] Yeah, it's it's kind of interesting. I
[12:54] uh let's say the median house is uh 500
[12:56] grand. Just pretty easy easy math,
[12:58] right? Um
[13:01] I I put up 50 to 100 grand. I get to buy
[13:04] a house. Yeah. Or well, I get to enter
[13:08] into a long-term obligation
[13:11] to service that contract, which is
[13:14] long-term interest rates, but also the
[13:17] obligation is I have to buy insurance. I
[13:20] have to keep the house up. I have to
[13:22] learn how to clean leaves out of the
[13:24] gutters. I know you guys love being a
[13:26] roof man. Uh, got married to that little
[13:30] girl that y'all wanted to do picnics on
[13:32] Saturdays and Sundays. You get married,
[13:34] you buy a house. Investment. Uh, baddest
[13:38] investment in the history of mankind, by
[13:40] the way. It's just a lie. Your parents
[13:42] were wrong. Their parents were wrong.
[13:45] And you'll be drastically wrong because
[13:47] they didn't have Bitcoin. You have the
[13:48] opportunity to Bitcoin. You don't care
[13:51] if I rent or if I own. When I invite you
[13:54] to dinner, then you don't you don't ask
[13:55] me, "Hey, do you own this whole hotel?"
[13:58] No, I don't. I rent it by the night.
[14:01] Nobody cares.
[14:03] So,
[14:05] you know, Bitcoin, I do not have any
[14:08] leaves to clean. I don't have hurricane
[14:10] protection to do. I don't If my plumbing
[14:14] goes bad and my housekeeper calls me
[14:16] right now, I have to stop this interview
[14:18] at your expense.
[14:20] You didn't ask me to buy a house.
[14:21] Imagine an employee coming to you go, "I
[14:24] got to go home for the plumbing." I look
[14:26] at him, "Bro, that's not my problem."
[14:28] You and your wife decided to buy a
[14:30] house. Let your wife do the plumbing,
[14:32] but you're making 100 grand a year here.
[14:33] You cannot just leave at 2:00 to go fix
[14:36] your investment, which is a bad
[14:38] investment. And they're going to keep
[14:40] going back home and fix it. So, it's
[14:42] just not Look, I'm interested in
[14:45] producing more energy with less energy.
[14:48] I want more to happen in less time.
[14:53] Time is grabbing
[14:57] for me. And the older you get, like
[14:59] you're going to remember this interview
[15:01] in 20 years. Like, hey, that guy really
[15:03] like time, dude, is worth more than one.
[15:07] Extremely finally is extremely poorly.
[15:12] No one's able to define when it's going
[15:15] to end. Um, no one can define when it's
[15:18] going to end. We treat time
[15:20] worse than we do money. Time is the only
[15:24] thing that's more valuable and more
[15:25] scarce than Bitcoin as long as we die.
[15:28] Said time. So if I can contract time,
[15:34] I actually raise lighten my whole load
[15:38] and I become more wealth.
[15:41] Wow. I don't think there's ever been a
[15:43] time I've never thought of that that
[15:45] way. I'm becoming more wealthy and
[15:48] lighter. And by lighter I mean lighter,
[15:52] less latigious issues, happier, no
[15:56] lawyers around me, no regulatory people,
[15:59] no tax people, no maintenance, no
[16:02] insurance, no, hey, you have to renew
[16:03] this contract.
[16:06] That is a lot of noise that I no longer
[16:09] have to deal with. Like I don't I'm not
[16:11] having somebody call me up. Hey Gary,
[16:13] you got to do the K1s.
[16:16] Right. It it it like most people
[16:18] complain that hey all these big
[16:20] companies in the big money I don't have
[16:22] a chance. You must stop saying that to
[16:25] yourself because it's not true. You're
[16:28] being a victim. Bitcoin,
[16:32] not real estate, not dollars, not the
[16:34] stock market, not Nvidia. Bitcoin
[16:38] puts me on an equal playing field with
[16:42] anyone that's in doubt about Bitcoin.
[16:45] Okay. And it actually raises my my
[16:49] profile. I was just with Dan Tapiro.
[16:52] Dan Dan's gonna be one of the richest
[16:54] guys in Bitcoin. He sees every bloody
[16:57] deal there is. And I can go give him the
[17:00] guy a hug. And like we're all on a
[17:02] similar level like but but
[17:06] you know if you do this you people I
[17:09] don't think people asking why are so
[17:11] many interesting people going into
[17:13] Bitcoin. That's what got me into
[17:15] Bitcoin. I was able to observe the
[17:17] people not not the price. I didn't even
[17:19] care about the price. I thought XRP and
[17:22] Salana and all these people they were
[17:24] idiots right I mean idiots just
[17:27] screaming at each other. But I saw the
[17:29] Dan Tapiros and the Dan Hells and and
[17:33] the just so many great
[17:36] high quality people. I mean, really
[17:38] brilliant people that I like hanging out
[17:41] with. And they were their
[17:42] characteristics are a lot like mine.
[17:45] Little roy can't really stick them in a
[17:48] cage. You know, they don't really fit
[17:51] the the MBA. That's how you do the
[17:55] program.
[17:56] And I found them very attractive, right?
[17:58] I found that wild spirit really. I like
[18:02] that. But when you stick this much
[18:04] intelligence into an industry, it always
[18:08] explodes.
[18:09] The the intellectual capital is more
[18:11] important than all the money coming
[18:13] here.
[18:14] People look at the money coming in. I
[18:16] look at the intellectual capital and go
[18:19] 140, 140, 140, 140. Whoa, whoa, whoa,
[18:25] man. 125 IQ. Uh, I'm going to slow down
[18:27] my weight. 140 IQ. Oh, man. They're
[18:30] coming through the door. Billions and
[18:33] billions of dollars.
[18:36] Like, small little wager bets. Okay, the
[18:38] these are like guys. I only do I only do
[18:43] digital. I will not look at an analog
[18:45] deal. Like, I wouldn't look at an analog
[18:47] deal. I don't care how good it is. If it
[18:50] isn't digital, I'm not touching it.
[18:53] I want to be an expert in this specific
[18:56] total focus,
[18:58] man. This is we're in stage one, man.
[19:01] We're in stage one. We have not even hit
[19:05] we've not left the atmosphere yet. Like,
[19:08] we're not even close to hitting that.
[19:10] What is the next stage for Bitcoin? 4
[19:12] trillion. It look it it's going to move
[19:15] through. It's going to go to three
[19:16] trillion. Three trillion to get it to
[19:18] the size of Saudi Aramcoat.
[19:21] uh three trillion gets it the size of
[19:24] Apple. It has to eat through these
[19:27] things. It's not taking anything from
[19:29] Apple. When I say eating through it,
[19:31] it's eating through market cap. It's
[19:34] growing, right? One day it's in the high
[19:37] school uh basketball, college
[19:41] tournaments and the next year it's in
[19:43] the Olympics,
[19:45] right? And it keeps going up. One day it
[19:47] is going to end up on the top tier
[19:50] because it has less friction. All the
[19:52] other buckets of money, bonds, debt,
[19:57] 300 trillion, they all have so much
[19:59] noise, so much friction, so much legacy.
[20:03] Bitcoin
[20:04] is like that cousin that's just free and
[20:07] he can do whatever he wants, right? Um,
[20:11] add that to all the 140 IQs that are
[20:14] walking through the door. So really and
[20:18] add to that a global complex that is
[20:21] under so much duress right now. So
[20:24] unstable. This is a cocktail for
[20:27] perfection
[20:29] to be protected against trauma, war,
[20:34] inflation, insanity,
[20:37] you know, degradation. I mean just
[20:40] Bitcoin's made me a better person
[20:41] actually. made me think about the
[20:43] goodness of one dollar over another. I
[20:46] don't even think all dollars are equal.
[20:48] I do not believe all dollars are equal.
[20:51] I believe there's probably very few
[20:52] dollars that are uncorrupted.
[20:55] And I care about that now. I do. I care
[20:58] about it. What do you mean? Uh what do
[21:00] you mean with like $1 is better than
[21:02] another one that from where you get it
[21:04] or like what what's the intention behind
[21:06] the the for instance I would rather
[21:08] crude oil $400
[21:11] and we stop killing people. I would
[21:14] rather pay $8 for gasoline like the
[21:17] Europeans do like you do then we keep
[21:20] killing people. I don't I don't need
[21:23] that much crude oil.
[21:25] Uh I think Americans would do very well.
[21:28] One, I think energy is too cheap and
[21:31] that is the one of the problems. Um, it
[21:35] establishes really bad behavior,
[21:37] consumption behavior. Most certainly
[21:39] energy in the United States is priced
[21:41] too cheaply. And I can prove it with
[21:44] anyone.
[21:45] Ask one simple question. How many people
[21:48] listening to this show turned their
[21:50] laptop computer off last night? It'll be
[21:53] a big fat zero.
[21:55] A million people. There'll be maybe 30
[21:58] people that turn their computer off.
[22:00] That is an extreme waste of energy. It
[22:02] tells you that the price of energy is
[22:04] too cheap because they don't care. Yeah.
[22:08] If it was priced right, we would turn it
[22:09] up. See, so inefficient. So the whole
[22:12] energy complex ends up in Bitcoin
[22:14] because of that. If you can understand
[22:16] that inefficiency on the demand side
[22:19] alone, wow. Not to mention, by the way,
[22:23] 23% of all the energy sitting on the
[22:26] front end of a pipe, it never makes it
[22:29] to market.
[22:31] There's no way to get there. That's all
[22:33] becomes big one. All of that becomes
[22:35] It's crazy to think about the the
[22:37] potential of that. Um, I want to get uh
[22:40] to to one thing uh with the borrowing
[22:42] against Bitcoin. I I I wanted to ask
[22:44] because it's a big topic right now in in
[22:47] Bitcoin uh that I get a lot of questions
[22:50] about like if you have some expense or
[22:52] you want to enjoy your life. We talked
[22:54] in the previous episodes with you a lot
[22:56] about hey like you should use your
[22:58] Bitcoin and enjoy life like not just
[23:00] stacking and like you you get Bitcoin to
[23:02] get freedom and not just like
[23:06] disagree. I disagree a little bit. Uh
[23:09] yeah, I disagree. I think people have
[23:12] too much pleasure
[23:14] and too little discipline. I can look
[23:16] most people that I've met, they they
[23:18] they look at me and my brother's life,
[23:20] my life, whatever, and they go, "Wow,
[23:21] you've only ever uh you you've only ever
[23:24] worked for yourself. You would never
[23:26] work for anyone." And it's like, "No,
[23:27] that's not true. I'd work for you
[23:29] tomorrow morning. I have nothing on who
[23:31] I'm working for. I could care less. I
[23:33] want to work with a great team. If I
[23:36] build a business though, that business
[23:38] I'm going to be broke most of the entire
[23:41] journey
[23:43] and by broke I mean I do not have the
[23:45] ability to invest in anything other than
[23:48] that business because it's become my
[23:50] little it's become who I am as a human
[23:53] being. I am Gary Cardone. I build
[23:55] technology business and I own
[23:57] chargebacks 911 blah blah blah right it
[24:00] becomes an identifier. Problem is, I'm
[24:02] on that journey for 10 to 12 years,
[24:04] maybe, but it's not going to be much
[24:06] shorter than that. And there is no
[24:08] pleasure when you're running your own
[24:10] company. Saturdays and Sundays, shit's
[24:12] happening. You show up. However,
[24:16] on on it seems like for some reason, the
[24:19] Bitcoin people that invest in Bitcoin
[24:23] want to make all the money in 12 days.
[24:26] Like if you hang for four years, you're
[24:27] not going to sell your Bitcoin on year
[24:29] five because you'll go, "Oh, wow. I'm
[24:31] gonna do this another eight years." Hold
[24:34] Bitcoin for four years. Remember,
[24:37] real estate's a 10year minimum. Private
[24:39] equity is a building your own
[24:42] businesses. And to have Bitcoin for a
[24:44] four-year stack, all you have to do is
[24:47] be disciplined for four to six years.
[24:49] Just tell your wife, dude, we're not
[24:50] going on a holiday for four years. It's
[24:53] cool. Go on the camping thing. You do
[24:55] not need to go on a $50,000. It's a half
[24:58] a Bitcoin. I mean, I can't I go on those
[25:02] kind, but I I mean, and and I
[25:06] not everything I do has a return on like
[25:09] I do enjoy my life, but I own a lot of
[25:11] Bitcoin, right? And I have no debt. I'm
[25:14] free, man. I have enough Bitcoin now
[25:17] that I have escaped what normal people
[25:21] call gravity or inflation.
[25:23] And I'm really regret saying that
[25:25] sometimes because I'm like it sounds
[25:27] bad, but like
[25:30] it it's taken me 50 years to learn this,
[25:33] man. Like, and I'm looking at going,
[25:36] "Wow, I've just learned the the Holy
[25:38] Grail. Took me 50 years, man. I've been
[25:41] digging hard for my whole life." I mean,
[25:43] it brings it makes me emotional.
[25:46] You can see almost like I'm like, "God."
[25:48] So, I would say yes. Do not go on
[25:51] holiday. Don't gamble. you know, spend
[25:54] four to six years, man, building super
[25:57] wealth and you're gonna you're gonna
[26:00] escape the gravity that most people
[26:01] feel. I mean, you could always go back
[26:03] and do something different if it doesn't
[26:05] work. But like I'll refund anybody's
[26:08] money over six years. I think I could
[26:11] make that financial advice. Even even
[26:13] here 107, I buy 107 four years, I will
[26:16] be in the money. No one that has ever
[26:18] hold held Bitcoin in 16 years has ever
[26:21] lost money. if they held it for four
[26:22] years and didn't get clever. It's the
[26:24] clever guys, dude. Like, I know people
[26:28] that are too smart for Bitcoin.
[26:31] I know a lot of them, dude. They're
[26:33] either too smart or too arrogant. One or
[26:36] the other. I say that to a lot of rich
[26:38] guys. It's all that. You might be too
[26:40] smart for Bitcoin.
[26:42] And it's a bit of both. You know, not
[26:45] hey, everybody gets Bitcoin when they
[26:47] deserve it. I think that's a horrible
[26:48] statement. But you might be too smart
[26:51] there, Rob. That NBA might cost you $300
[26:55] million. Like I see that a lot, man.
[26:57] Overthinking this thing. You can
[26:59] overthink this thing really easy. That
[27:02] that that's really interesting. I love
[27:04] that you said you're zero depth. Well, I
[27:06] have debt, but I have control. I believe
[27:09] in debt. Okay. Uh I believe in correctly
[27:14] priced debt and the right volume. I
[27:17] don't believe in 12% debt.
[27:20] I don't I borrow against my Bitcoin. I
[27:24] refuse to pay 10, 11, 12, 15%. [ __ ] you.
[27:28] The greatest collateral in the world.
[27:31] You can call yourself a Bitcoin company
[27:33] if you want, but if you come after me
[27:35] and charge me, try to charge me 15% for
[27:37] lending my Bitcoin uh money back on my
[27:41] Bitcoin, I don't think you're really a
[27:43] Bitcoin. Think you're another parasite.
[27:46] uh that's trying to suck the life out
[27:48] and and these rates are on hold. Yeah, I
[27:49] got rates in the single digits
[27:52] in volume.
[27:54] That means this is all going to change
[27:55] now. Like you're going to have no one
[27:58] ever needs to sell their Bitcoin.
[28:00] I I I'm won't say never, but there is no
[28:04] need for me to sell Bitcoin. I just paid
[28:06] my taxes borrowing against my Bitcoin.
[28:10] And if I can borrow at five or six, I
[28:13] can outpace five or six. the 10-year
[28:15] Treasury. All the financial wizards are,
[28:19] you know, doing their mental
[28:20] masturbation at 8:00 in the morning on
[28:22] all these finance shows going yield is
[28:25] going to destroy the whole world. My
[28:27] brother even. And I'm like, bro, let me
[28:29] just ask you, would you borrow money?
[28:32] Would you lend me money at 5 and a half%
[28:34] which is 500 basis points less than the
[28:36] 10-year Treasury? Would you loan me
[28:39] money at 5 and a half% for 10 years?
[28:41] Would you? I I got excellent credit.
[28:44] Would you loan me money for five and a
[28:46] half% for 10 years? Because the the
[28:48] treasury is is at five. So I'll pay you
[28:51] a premium. Would you do that? The answer
[28:53] is going to be no way. Would you borrow
[28:56] a trillion dollars at 5% for 10, 20, or
[29:00] 30 years? Yes, please. And that's why
[29:03] the 10ear Treasury ain't going down. And
[29:06] when I say this to people, it drives me
[29:08] crazy, man. No. No, you're wrong. Oh,
[29:10] yes. I am most certainly right. This is
[29:13] why demand. Those are the people that
[29:14] are too smart for first year. And
[29:17] they're actually dumb because they're
[29:19] not really looking at reality. The
[29:21] reality is over 30 years the average
[29:23] interest rate has been 8 and a half to
[29:25] 9% in the entire US economy between 1972
[29:29] and today exploded
[29:31] on interest that is 40% more expensive
[29:35] than it is today. And everyone's
[29:37] freaking out. I'm like, what? If you
[29:38] cannot run the world on 6 or 7% debt,
[29:43] there is something wrong. If I can't
[29:45] find a way to make a 6% improvement
[29:48] every year on my life, there must be
[29:51] something.
[29:53] Yeah. Maybe I'm spending too much money.
[29:54] That's usually the problem. After the
[29:56] Yeah. Oh, totally. D to. Now, on that, I
[30:02] just like to go somewhere because
[30:03] everybody thinks this is about Bitcoin.
[30:05] You go, "Oh, yeah, but I can't buy
[30:07] $100,000 Bitcoin." I met a woman in
[30:09] here, 31 years old. She's divorced, got
[30:13] two kids. She owns 30 Bitcoin. And when
[30:16] I looked at her, she told me she owed 30
[30:17] Bitcoin. I said, "Wow, you're the first
[30:19] woman I've ever met at 30 years old that
[30:22] can literally tell any man on the planet
[30:24] to [ __ ] off." Now, why do I say that and
[30:27] why am I so rude? I think freedom. My
[30:30] question to everyone is, "Hey, how do
[30:33] you define freedom?" Remember when we
[30:35] did this, I had this when you when I did
[30:38] that. I like doing these shows because
[30:41] the more I speak out loud, I really do
[30:43] try to be extremely honorable. I'm not
[30:46] pitching anything. I have nothing to
[30:48] pitch. I buy Bitcoin. You can't buy my
[30:50] Bitcoin.
[30:52] Anybody, right? And that allows me to be
[30:55] extremely neutral on the viewpoint.
[30:58] And I look at it this way. This
[31:00] 30-year-old woman, what she should do is
[31:02] pound herself into this industry now
[31:05] because there is no I could get 40 jobs
[31:09] here today.
[31:11] You could get dozens of job. Why would
[31:14] they hire us? Because we're here, man.
[31:17] If you're a woman, there are no women in
[31:19] this industry. You should come into this
[31:20] industry. If you don't have a resume or
[31:23] a college degree, you should come into
[31:26] Bitcoin, dude. We don't care. In fact,
[31:28] I'll build a case. It's better to have a
[31:30] blank sheet. Yeah. If I if they had good
[31:33] parents like you, you had good parents.
[31:36] Guarantee you had good parents because
[31:38] you're you're you show up. You're
[31:40] consistent. That's all I need to say.
[31:42] You're consistent. You had good parents.
[31:43] Did you have good parents? Totally.
[31:46] Absolutely. You're going to raise your
[31:47] kids the way your parents raised you if
[31:49] you if you marry the right chick. So I
[31:50] just So the job part
[31:53] it it's so stupid because they're like I
[31:55] can't afford a h 100red grand. Well
[31:57] there's a $100,000 job in Bitcoin
[31:59] waiting for you. Now you may not start
[32:01] at 100. You might start at eight but
[32:04] right now you're at zero. So who cares?
[32:07] Hey, you should pay to come in this. You
[32:10] should talk to your dad and go, "Hey,
[32:11] look, instead of me going to college, I
[32:13] bet you pay Gary Cardone or Robin 12, 15
[32:17] grand a year and go mentor in tutelage
[32:21] and be become an apprentice for a master
[32:24] like Michelangelo did. Michelangelo
[32:27] didn't get paid to become a genius. He
[32:30] worked for a mediocre
[32:32] marble master, a mediocre guy. Then he
[32:36] swept the freaking
[32:39] and now he know hard to make good marble
[32:42] when when the floor is dust
[32:45] right that's the piece people forget oh
[32:47] wow order is necessary for a business
[32:51] organization
[32:53] order and organization are not required
[32:54] in Bitcoin
[32:56] HR no requirements for HR thanking God
[33:00] no HR department who wants to hire big
[33:03] HR department consultant
[33:06] It's the only people that want a big
[33:08] truck. So, the jobs, man. I mean, look
[33:10] at you. You're living a really robust
[33:13] life because you found the industry that
[33:15] embraces who you are. It doesn't try to
[33:18] change you. Every industry I've ever
[33:21] been in, they all wanted me to be a
[33:23] little different. And it's irritating
[33:27] because it because it styies creativity
[33:29] and innovation.
[33:31] styies when I have to wear a suit and a
[33:34] white tie and look like everyone else.
[33:37] It literally a sty innovation. I wear I
[33:39] wear a Jimmyi Hendris t-shirt all the
[33:41] time. I love my Jimmyi Hendris t-shirt
[33:44] because it's literally a silent message
[33:46] to everyone. Why do we all agate over
[33:51] extreme personalities and then we spend
[33:54] an entire lifetime
[33:56] trying to be as vanilla as possible?
[33:59] It It's sad. Janice Jobs and Donald
[34:02] Trump. Say what you want. It outrageous.
[34:04] I It's weird. That's weird to me. We
[34:07] agate all these crazy people
[34:11] and then we become we don't want to be
[34:13] that crazy.
[34:15] I want to be bra like I want to be
[34:17] really really unique and free. And this
[34:19] freedom thing
[34:21] back to that point is my ability to say
[34:25] yes
[34:26] to anything. Whether I do it or not is
[34:28] different. Can I get on a private plan
[34:30] and go wherever the hell I want? That
[34:32] may be really crazy dream for some
[34:34] people, but I have
[34:37] I have I'm able to go do that. It's
[34:39] cool. Don't have to like smash you with
[34:42] or anything. It's a cool thing. I'm also
[34:45] able to say no
[34:47] to anyone about anything, including DOJ,
[34:51] SEC, FBI. [ __ ] it. Stop it, dude. I
[34:55] don't do anything wrong. You can't come
[34:56] hurt me. I'm not going to let you come
[34:58] and capture me. So, the ability to say
[35:00] yes and no.
[35:03] I don't think many people have that,
[35:05] man.
[35:06] 21st century, we should have the ability
[35:08] though, the power to say yes and no to
[35:11] anything. I' I've never had that until I
[35:14] met this industry. Let's take a break
[35:16] for a moment and appreciate the beauty
[35:19] that Coin Vigilante has made with the
[35:22] Bitcoin watches. Those watches are the
[35:24] most amazing, the most elegant way of
[35:28] showing that you are a true Bitcoiner.
[35:31] And Coin Vigilante just dropped a
[35:33] completely new and amazing Genesis
[35:36] edition of their watch collections. You
[35:39] have the date of the first ever minded
[35:42] Bitcoin block in there. And of course,
[35:44] also the block height and which epoch we
[35:47] are currently in. I love the level of
[35:50] detail they put in in this masterpiece.
[35:53] Make sure to check out those amazing
[35:55] coin vigilante time pieces down in the
[35:58] descriptions. I love those watches so so
[36:01] much. And now, if you have Bitcoin, I
[36:04] really do hope that you don't have it on
[36:06] exchange. But if you do have it on
[36:08] exchange, I have two ways for you to
[36:10] deal with that. The first way is you put
[36:12] it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[36:14] entry for you to get into the
[36:17] self-custody game. I recommend Bitbox
[36:20] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[36:23] super simple and secure way. And if you
[36:25] check out the link in the description,
[36:27] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[36:30] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[36:33] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[36:37] partner in terms of how to get the most
[36:40] out of your sovereignty. They will
[36:42] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[36:45] that is perfect for your individual
[36:48] situation. They will show you how you
[36:50] can secure your own devices. Securing
[36:53] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[36:55] have to keep all your devices secure.
[36:57] One topic that is overlooked often is
[37:00] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[37:03] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[37:05] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[37:08] place already? And last but not least,
[37:10] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[37:12] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[37:14] plan B. For all that, head over to the
[37:17] bitcoinway.com/roin
[37:20] to get a 30inut free call. And just a
[37:24] quick side note, I will be for the first
[37:26] time ever speaking at the Bitcoin Prague
[37:29] event in June. It will be absolutely
[37:32] legendary and I'm really looking forward
[37:34] to seeing all of you there. You can get
[37:36] your ticket in the link down in the
[37:39] description of Bitcoin Prague. And very
[37:41] important, use code Robin to get 10% off
[37:45] your ticket. I'm really looking forward
[37:47] seeing you there. It's so interesting
[37:49] because I've I see outside of Bitcoin
[37:52] almost never people that are doing
[37:56] anything abnormal, anything wild. And in
[38:01] Bitcoin, it's almost exclusively wild
[38:03] things that people are doing. It's they
[38:06] have really wild CDs. They have wild
[38:10] experiences and they have really
[38:11] interesting opinions. That's why I have
[38:14] a podcast with over 500 episodes and I'm
[38:17] still not bored or like a
[38:21] not bored. It's it's still super
[38:23] interesting and it gets interesting more
[38:25] interesting over time because there are
[38:26] so many different characters and I mean
[38:28] we are sitting here the third time now
[38:31] and I feel like we can do it another 50
[38:34] times and and I'm still like figing new
[38:37] things from you out and learn new things
[38:38] from you. It's it's it's quite how how
[38:41] deep this those Bitcoin personalities
[38:43] do. Yeah. I think uh
[38:47] I love to think, excuse me, I love to
[38:49] think in pictures
[38:52] and I think about Mercury. Bitcoin looks
[38:55] to me like Mercury in that
[38:58] if you put Mercury on a table and
[39:00] there's a gap somewhere, it's
[39:02] immediately going to that gap and it
[39:04] fills the gap up. Someone asked me once,
[39:07] he said, "Hey, how would you define your
[39:10] career in a couple of sentences?" Like I
[39:12] find big big gaps and fill them. I mean
[39:17] that is really basic. Like you laugh and
[39:20] you're like that's damn smart. I don't
[39:22] need to write a big book about it, man.
[39:24] Find a gap, fill it, find a bigger gap,
[39:27] fill it. That's creates a business.
[39:29] Supply and demand. Oh, there's some
[39:32] people don't even know there's a crack.
[39:34] Before Bitcoin, nobody really knew there
[39:36] was a 3 and a half to 8% gap in Visa,
[39:39] Mastercard payment process. uh uh most
[39:42] beautiful duopoly that is by the way
[39:45] duopoly is basically a double monopoly
[39:48] construct that operate as a monopoly
[39:52] uh passively and they never get in
[39:54] trouble for it and the DOJ SEC FTC and
[39:57] every other governmental agency support
[40:00] you getting completely hosed completely
[40:03] hosed and completely more hosed by a
[40:06] duopoly that is grossly inefficient.
[40:09] There is no competition for them and
[40:11] that is why they're grossly inefficient.
[40:14] Just like all the fracking on this
[40:16] planet in oil and gas happened at $30
[40:19] crude, not 100 governments. If you don't
[40:23] allow competition, which you've allowed
[40:25] to facilitate no more than four four
[40:28] companies running every industry on this
[40:30] planet, we will continue to have people
[40:33] paying too much for too many things
[40:36] because you have no competition and
[40:38] you're supporting a monopoly contract.
[40:40] It's disgusting. is absolutely
[40:43] disgusting that congressmen and women
[40:45] are in office making millions of dollars
[40:48] doing I don't know what how they make
[40:49] that much money but they then allow Visa
[40:53] Masterard the banking cartels the energy
[40:57] complex the financial house the debt
[41:02] markets that the the Google and freaky
[41:07] Google construct on social media is
[41:09] disgusting they take they take 30 33% of
[41:13] every dollar you send him on YouTube.
[41:16] Don't send him YouTube through YouTube,
[41:18] dude. Send him crypto. Okay? Because
[41:21] we're feeding Visa Mastercard every time
[41:23] we do that. I stopped taking money.
[41:26] Don't send me a contribution.
[41:28] I don't want to help Visa. 33% to give
[41:31] to uh whoever Google go. By the way, I'm
[41:36] complaining about Visa. Google's making
[41:38] $33.
[41:39] Somebody sent me out 300 bucks to Google
[41:42] Spre 100 bucks for what? For my content.
[41:46] For my content. So that should not even
[41:49] be allowed, man. Like literally I
[41:51] stopped doing it because I will not
[41:52] support the supply.
[41:55] So like you started smiling when I said
[41:58] y'all send him digital. Like he doesn't
[42:00] see this is where I build a case for
[42:03] other tokens. I could easily build a
[42:06] case that other tokens are less
[42:08] predatory and evil than Visa Mascot.
[42:11] Like let's remember who the real enemy
[42:13] is XRP, Salana and all you. The real
[42:16] enemy is not each other. The real enemy
[42:19] is all the stuff outside in Legacy Lane
[42:22] and we're sitting here Brad Garlinghouse
[42:24] is arguing with us about Bitcoin. He's
[42:26] like, "Bro, we shouldn't be doing that,
[42:27] man. Should be one common message
[42:31] and the best crypto wins. This crypto is
[42:34] not certainly going to be Bitcoin. You
[42:36] can go chase this alpha if you want.
[42:39] It's stupid. I mean, this is dumb and
[42:41] dumb. Uh, it just shows me you have a
[42:44] broke mindset, right? Why would you buy
[42:47] a Volkswagen
[42:49] that's a used Volkswagen never been
[42:51] tested when this super freaking car
[42:55] sitting here dully
[42:57] tested?
[42:59] Like I I don't I don't even get it. It's
[43:02] like It's like you're getting ready to
[43:04] get maybe married, do the old prop, and
[43:07] then I see you on a Saturday night
[43:09] hanging out chasing some 19y old skank
[43:14] cuz it's 2:00 in the morning. You think
[43:15] it's going to be fun. It is going to be
[43:17] fun.
[43:19] And Sunday or Monday, you're going to
[43:21] have a lot of regret.
[43:23] Uh you might have got a little pop on
[43:25] the old dick meter, but it's not a good
[43:28] investment.
[43:30] See, short-term excitement has nothing
[43:33] to do with a four to eight year gravity
[43:36] defying time
[43:38] defying machine. Like you're comparing
[43:41] an idiot to the greatest opportunity in
[43:44] history at some moment. You might as
[43:46] well just go master.
[43:48] You know what I'm saying? I mean, I know
[43:50] this is a hard example, but in fact, the
[43:54] only worst example I could use would be
[43:56] using drugs,
[43:58] recreational drugs, right? So, it just
[44:01] there's a lot of weird
[44:05] contradictions when people look at
[44:06] Bitcoin.
[44:08] They they I think it's because they're
[44:11] carrying all this weight, legacy weight,
[44:14] that you have to get through that weight
[44:16] of what you think you know that is just
[44:18] not true.
[44:20] What you think you know, you're sure you
[44:22] know, but in fact, it's just not true.
[44:26] There's a lot of people that, you know,
[44:28] I've seen a lot of people lose a lot of
[44:29] money. They were certain it was for sure
[44:33] and it was based on just bad data
[44:36] fundamentally wrong data like what is
[44:38] inflation just come and look just any of
[44:40] that what's gravity
[44:43] I love that and it's a it's a focus
[44:46] that's really hard for people especially
[44:49] the new ones they're like they're
[44:51] they're going all over the place with
[44:53] like where they're going and what what
[44:55] they're doing in Bitcoin and even like
[44:57] going into different altcoins like I I
[45:00] completely changed actually my opinion
[45:01] on the altcoins. Before I started the
[45:03] podcast, it was really toxic. I was
[45:04] like, hey, like we should burn all the
[45:07] altcoins down and now I'm like I focus
[45:09] solely on Bitcoin, but they can live
[45:12] like they can do whatever they want.
[45:13] It's it's it's fine what they're doing
[45:16] and but that focus gets lost, you know,
[45:18] like the the I especially younger. I I
[45:22] analyzed today actually the age range of
[45:25] my uh YouTube statistics and I have
[45:29] three times as many people over 65 then
[45:32] under my age under 26 years old
[45:35] because all the people under my age
[45:37] they're chasing a 100x memecoin
[45:42] and the people that are 35 this is the
[45:44] contradiction I'm talking about. Yeah.
[45:46] They have more time than I do and
[45:48] they're not betting on Bitcoin. They're
[45:49] trying to speed it up.
[45:51] And I'm sitting here going, "Oh, I'm I
[45:54] don't need any of that action. I don't
[45:56] need any speed. What I need is
[45:57] certainty.
[45:59] Pure certainty." What do you see as the
[46:02] one thing that most Bitcoiners could
[46:05] improve on? Like uh what wherever you
[46:07] want to take it in life or like in
[46:09] Bitcoin, in the ecosystem, whatever,
[46:10] wherever you want to take it. One one of
[46:12] the reasons uh
[46:15] a number of people have made the comment
[46:18] they're like Gary uh like they think
[46:22] I've been here for a long time right and
[46:24] I haven't been here for a long time. Um
[46:26] I've been here maybe four and a half
[46:28] years and they're like you came in so
[46:31] hard so heavy. One you didn't know I'd
[46:34] been studying it. Two I had a problem. I
[46:37] had a problem. Okay. My problem was I
[46:41] was running faster. I was having to run
[46:44] faster,
[46:46] do more, and wait longer for the results
[46:49] and I could feel it. I also knew that
[46:52] there I I I've always been able to see
[46:55] risk in the market.
[46:57] And although I may look like uh like my
[47:00] brother Jay, he think like he we just
[47:02] operate very different. I take I'm
[47:04] pretty early on the risk cards
[47:07] and uh served me very very well. Um the
[47:12] problems that I was seeing were not
[47:15] going to get fixed with investing more
[47:17] dollars into more US dollar businesses
[47:20] or more legacy business. See this this
[47:23] is the way I look at this. We are
[47:24] digitizing
[47:26] planet Earth. We've we we've crossed
[47:30] over this critical mass point where
[47:34] eight track tape. You don't even know
[47:35] what an eight track tape is. I used to
[47:37] listen to grand f smoking bad marijuana
[47:41] early in the morning to go to school
[47:42] with Grant and there was this big old
[47:44] thing. It was this big and you stick it
[47:46] in a machine this big in your car and
[47:48] the tape would wobble. You know, that
[47:51] was our music, dude. We had I had 30
[47:54] cassettes sitting in my you know they're
[47:56] big too but that was the way we did
[47:58] music. Now today I have 50,000
[48:03] pieces of music on a thing I hold in my
[48:06] pocket that weighs less than a pound. Uh
[48:08] I'm pretty sure I'm never going to use
[48:10] that eight track tape player. If that's
[48:12] true we will only digitize more. Right.
[48:15] This is now we've met critical math
[48:17] though. They're moving from analog
[48:20] because these two worlds in fact will
[48:22] not coexist. This is why I'm so can be
[48:25] so committed cuz I know how long it will
[48:29] take. Legacy Visa, Mastercard, JP
[48:32] Morgan, any company that's got an HR
[48:34] department, they're going to just
[48:37] struggle moving in. You have to move in
[48:39] hard and fast into this industry with
[48:42] the least amount of baggage. And that's
[48:45] why I'm short. By the way, Bitcoin
[48:47] allows me I it is a it is a option that
[48:52] allows me to short
[48:55] the entire legacy market with never
[48:59] having to pay a premium.
[49:02] And if I'm wrong, I don't lose on the
[49:05] put because if I'm wrong, the value of
[49:09] Bitcoin will go up anyway. And so, and
[49:13] then I have a call option on Bitcoin.
[49:16] It's it's a really as soon as I came in
[49:19] here, I went, "Oh my god, this is a long
[49:21] duration put and a long duration call
[49:24] out." And I hate I rarely use any of
[49:27] this terminology. If you notice, I don't
[49:30] want need to sound more important than I
[49:32] am because I'm not really that important
[49:34] or relevant, but also I don't need to
[49:36] call a insurance policy a fancy name.
[49:40] But that is what it is. It's a long day
[49:42] call option with no premium. a guy like
[49:45] uh you know commodity traders would be
[49:47] like yeah that's exactly what it is
[49:49] that's very different than a piece of
[49:50] real estate.
[49:51] Um so it's it's look it's a fact I want
[49:56] to be in industries that are exciting. I
[49:58] have no interest in investing in a
[50:00] boring thing. I don't want to be bored
[50:02] and most people don't think about living
[50:05] their life and living in their work.
[50:08] Like I don't really go to work. I'm
[50:10] never going to work. I go club and I go
[50:12] do my deal. And this is my this is I
[50:14] have no hobbies.
[50:16] I like this is what I do, man. I'm I'm
[50:20] really good at it. Just like a
[50:22] professional athlete focuses on being a
[50:25] professional athlete and they train
[50:26] their whole lifetime. They don't give up
[50:28] on Sundays. I know people that go work
[50:31] for General Dynamics and Monday morning
[50:33] they start off they start looking at who
[50:35] they're going to call and what their
[50:37] plan is. Can't live your life like that,
[50:40] dude. I I never stop thinking about it's
[50:42] not always I meet people I'm living my
[50:46] life and my life is allowing me to make
[50:48] money and generate income and add value
[50:52] and I I get to feel good about and I
[50:54] make a lot you know in fact I don't even
[50:56] want to make anymore imagine getting to
[50:58] a position where you're like oh I don't
[51:01] even want any income
[51:03] all you want to do is keep investing not
[51:06] saving keep investing and building
[51:08] investing and building, keeping that
[51:11] foundation, that concrete foundation,
[51:13] you're just making it thicker and
[51:15] thicker and thicker without adding any
[51:18] weight. Wow.
[51:20] I'm at breakfast this morning with some
[51:22] big real estate guys and they're like,
[51:24] "All right, this is the best location in
[51:26] the planet, man. Location, location,
[51:28] location." I'm like, you know, you guys,
[51:31] I just love Bitcoin. It's the best
[51:34] location and it has no location. And
[51:37] they both looking nice. Huh? This guy's
[51:39] on drugs, right?
[51:42] Best location ever. No. Like, welcome to
[51:45] the paradigm.
[51:47] This is the future of digitization.
[51:49] Location. No location. I love that. Um,
[51:52] we have one question that I ask each and
[51:54] every one of my guests. Uh, but I
[51:57] changed it a little bit. Uh, because
[51:58] otherwise it will get boring over time
[52:00] with this guest that have been all mad
[52:02] puns. Um, what have you learned since
[52:05] you have last been on the podcast? So,
[52:07] like I think like a half a year or
[52:08] something like that. Um, outside of
[52:10] Bitcoin
[52:12] outside of Bitcoin. Well, I will say
[52:16] exclusively and first to present on your
[52:18] show through Rumble
[52:21] that I I've been very transparent uh for
[52:25] since I've been here that I've had all
[52:28] these FTC investigations and I had the
[52:31] three-letter agencies checking me out
[52:34] with no red flags whatsoever. But
[52:36] whatever, four years, four or five
[52:39] years, this was old. That whole old
[52:42] administration wanted to kill anybody in
[52:43] crypto and kill anybody that's doing
[52:46] innovation. Yesterday I got a letter
[52:49] courts have completely thrown everything
[52:51] out. There were RICO filings against me,
[52:53] man. I mean I have some of the biggest
[52:55] consulting firms in the world going,
[52:57] "Bro, you got a RICO claim got against
[52:59] you?" I'm like, "Yeah, I told you this
[53:00] bullshit." But I spent four and a half
[53:03] years going through this process and
[53:05] I'll tell you one, Bitcoin protected me.
[53:09] It allowed me to stay strong.
[53:13] I never did anything wrong. I never
[53:15] stopped being quiet about not doing
[53:17] anything wrong. I was not obnoxious, but
[53:19] I didn't do anything wrong and I beat
[53:21] their ass. This is a class action group
[53:23] of lawyers. What they are allowed to do
[53:26] in the United States is absolutely
[53:28] disgusting. I beat the I settled the FTC
[53:31] case. Spent $7 million over. They wanted
[53:34] a h 100red grand for some felonious
[53:37] horrible fraud that I committed. It
[53:39] should have been a hundred million and
[53:41] you should put me in prison. If I did
[53:43] something wrong, Google just got a $95
[53:46] million bill for stealing everybody's
[53:48] data. Like 95 million should have been
[53:51] 95 billion, dude. And put the people in
[53:54] jail. No one ever goes to jail. I do
[53:56] something wrong. DOJ, slap my ass in
[53:59] jail and stop me from operating the
[54:01] market. You can't keep just taking
[54:03] payments from people. Let me just write
[54:05] a check for every bad thing I've done.
[54:09] So, this is not working anymore, man.
[54:12] United Health $280 billion worth of
[54:14] market cap in four days. Three CEOs. One
[54:17] shot in the middle in front of a hotel.
[54:20] These businesses have problems. You red
[54:23] flag, red flag, red flag. Like, I'm
[54:25] looking at the red flags. That's what
[54:27] I've learned. Oh my god, man. Open your
[54:29] eyes to the red flags. Three CEOs in
[54:33] four years. A United Healthcare and a
[54:35] murder and a stock price that smoke,
[54:39] smoke, smoke. There might be a fire
[54:40] scene. I mean, this is inline times 10.
[54:45] These are monster companies. The other
[54:47] thing I've learned,
[54:50] we're in a very different paradigm
[54:52] today.
[54:54] Never before in the history of finance,
[54:56] excuse me, have we had companies on the
[55:00] stock public stock market moving $250
[55:03] billion dollars in a day. Nvidia,
[55:06] Nvidia's done that three times in the
[55:08] last year. These are colossal tier you
[55:11] could have bought for $65 the other day.
[55:13] It's 130 bucks. United Health is $280
[55:17] billion. This has never happened, dude.
[55:19] These are catastrophic hammers. And then
[55:21] what happens the next day? The S&P goes
[55:23] up. We file a nuclear weapon somewhere,
[55:27] the S&P goes up. We blow pipelines up,
[55:30] the S&P goes up. We have a terror attack
[55:32] in Israel, the S&P goes up. We have
[55:35] Moody's down at the United States, the
[55:38] S&P goes up. At the end of the day,
[55:41] dude,
[55:42] literally the end of the day,
[55:43] celebrating. That market is being
[55:45] massively managed. And if you can't see
[55:47] it, you must be blind. So, I've learned
[55:51] that the gravity is getting heavier.
[55:54] The opportunities are massive. There's
[55:57] tons of glittery objects all over the
[56:00] place. And most people are going to
[56:02] chase the glittery objects, and they're
[56:04] going to be wrong.
[56:06] I'm going to I'm going to continue
[56:07] amassing as much freaking Bitcoin as I
[56:11] possibly can. My goal is to acquire a
[56:13] thousand Bitcoin as a single entity. I
[56:16] hope I can get there. I think I can get
[56:19] there. It's a long haul. But when people
[56:22] tell me, "Hey, look, man, I can't even
[56:24] buy one." Bro, my goal is a thousand.
[56:28] My goal relative to your one is much
[56:31] harder to achieve. I don't know that I'm
[56:34] going to achieve it, but I have a goal
[56:36] for quantity of Bitcoin. I've learned to
[56:38] do that. It's no longer dollars. It's
[56:41] like, how many Bitcoin do I want more
[56:44] Bitcoin? Uh, this is a real estate pl
[56:47] just to go back to real estate. If you
[56:49] really think that the Manhattan real
[56:51] estate gig, yes, the Monaco I own all
[56:54] the land in Monaco. If you like that
[56:55] play,
[56:57] Bitcoin is the greatest location with no
[57:00] jurisdictional location risk. I can just
[57:03] move it around, man. I cannot move
[57:06] Beverly Hills
[57:08] to Saudi Arabia.
[57:10] I don't care how nice the hotel is, man.
[57:13] The other thing I've learned also and
[57:16] the big premium is how many wonderful
[57:19] people like you I have met and that I'm
[57:22] going to develop lifetime relationships
[57:25] out of this industry that I have never
[57:27] been able to achieve in natural gas,
[57:31] electricity in two countries, payments
[57:34] or real estate. I've never achieved this
[57:37] many really good relationships
[57:40] where I can call Jeff Boo. Hey Jeff, I
[57:43] have a problem and I'm thinking about
[57:45] doing something but it might be what are
[57:47] you thinking? And I, you know, be able
[57:50] to call people like that. uh just to
[57:53] clear get some rational thought process
[57:57] is really a beautiful thing and uh and I
[58:01] I value that and I want to be in an
[58:03] industry where it's more than the trade
[58:06] the openness it's I'm able to embrace my
[58:09] life around work and and and there you
[58:12] don't wouldn't not even know when I'm
[58:14] working like you you would have a if a
[58:18] girl comes to my house and hangs out
[58:19] with me for she doesn't ever know when
[58:22] I'm really for it cuz everything for me
[58:25] it I there is no I'm enjoying my life
[58:30] and
[58:32] imagine if we told our children to do
[58:34] that from six or seven that they're not
[58:37] on a treadmill man being hamsters
[58:41] you know I mean that's a it's taken me a
[58:44] long time to learn that to get that it's
[58:46] a gift to it's a gift for me to be able
[58:48] to go I don't have to go do a bunch of
[58:50] stuff to generate I I love that we
[58:53] unfortunately already a little bit of at
[58:55] the end of our time. Um we have one more
[58:58] question as always the end routine we
[59:00] had where the previous guest asking a
[59:01] question for the next guest without
[59:03] knowing who the next guest actually is
[59:05] and it's a really interesting one. It's
[59:07] outside of Bitcoin. He asked what is one
[59:11] habit that you have that was always
[59:14] there and you never want to give up if
[59:16] there's some habit that is doing your
[59:18] life. Well,
[59:20] the habit is being an absolute extreme
[59:25] hyperfocused
[59:26] consolidated player. And by that I mean
[59:29] obsession have served me extremely well.
[59:32] And I will no longer listen to anyone
[59:36] that suggested
[59:38] that I should have done anything other
[59:40] than be extremely obnoxious. I mean like
[59:44] like I stay up to four o'clock in the
[59:46] morning painting.
[59:48] I have people like hey you can't live it
[59:51] is that it is that
[59:54] just diving in deep man that for me I
[59:58] want to die that way and God guy was
[60:00] just going all in balls busting I don't
[60:02] know if I can paint dude but I'm going
[60:04] to try and uh for for nothing more than
[60:08] hey I think if I do something enough I
[60:10] can become great. There's no natural
[60:13] gifts. I mean, I think I have some
[60:15] natural gifts, but this this thing of I
[60:18] think I've I think I've met maybe six%
[60:21] of Gary Cordon. Six, seven, six. No,
[60:24] more than 10. No more than 10. Because
[60:25] if I'm in a different environment, I
[60:27] notice that I'm different.
[60:29] I'm not I know, right? It's totally like
[60:32] you're in a different environment with
[60:33] different people. I know that um because
[60:35] I speak English and German. Um, I'm
[60:39] different on a German speaking Bitcoin
[60:42] podcast. I speak about different topics
[60:44] than I'm on an English speaking podcast.
[60:46] It's like even if you're different
[60:47] languages, it's just fascinating.
[60:51] Absolutely. Thank you so much, Gary. Um,
[60:54] before I let you go, as always, where
[60:55] can people find you're never going to
[60:57] find Bitcoin? So easy to find. It's
[61:00] dumb. So, yeah. Let's stop Gary. Gary.
[61:04] No, there's a I don't want anything to
[61:06] do with that.
[61:08] Thank you so much, Gary. It was a
[61:09] pleasure. And uh as always, thank you so
[61:12] much for joining me. And uh I'll be back
[61:14] tomorrow with another episode.
