[00:00] You might want to delay a purchase of
[00:02] the house as long as humanly possible if
[00:05] you don't need it emotionally. I can
[00:07] really just spend the Bitcoin that I
[00:08] earn because Bitcoin is money and it's
[00:11] supposed to be used. If I can invest in
[00:13] my knowledge, in my skills, that's
[00:15] probably the only place you can put your
[00:18] Bitcoin that has an higher return on
[00:20] investment than just keeping it in
[00:22] Bitcoin. Once we get Bitcoin, all of the
[00:24] sudden, we get this fear of missing out
[00:27] of of like I want to get more Bitcoin.
[00:29] Oh [ __ ] Like what if it shoots up like
[00:31] crazy tomorrow? How can I save um my
[00:35] finances? How can I save the finances of
[00:37] my family, of my company, of my
[00:39] whatever? And we can only hope that the
[00:42] nation state we are living in embraces
[00:44] it Bitcoin at some point. If not, we
[00:47] might have to consider the move. And for
[00:48] me, everyone is a Bitcoiner who holds or
[00:50] uses Bitcoin in some capacity. But if
[00:52] you really want to benefit and and and
[00:54] embrace that that new revolution, go as
[00:57] all in as you possibly
[00:58] [Music]
[01:02] can. An extremely personal podcast. I
[01:05] loved how Leia was asking questions,
[01:07] really really good questions actually.
[01:10] And uh the the key the three key topics
[01:13] that we've discussed is basically my
[01:15] journey, how I'm living on a Bitcoin
[01:17] standard. What you have can what you can
[01:18] learn also from like living on a Bitcoin
[01:21] standard, how you do that. And but we
[01:23] also discussed late in the podcast how
[01:26] Bitcoin is a completely global paradigm
[01:28] shift and what this actually means for
[01:32] Bitcoin and also for our society and how
[01:35] we can learn from the past to kind of
[01:37] predict what will happen to Bitcoin and
[01:40] what will happen to our society once
[01:43] Bitcoin is actually successful and
[01:45] actually mainstream. So enjoy. Robin,
[01:48] how the devil are you sir? I'm I'm doing
[01:51] really good. Thank you so much for
[01:52] having me. Good, mate. This is a this is
[01:56] a blessing. Um, I really appreciate you
[01:58] accepting my invite to come on to this
[02:01] random uh very much unknown Bitcoin
[02:04] podcast based out of the United Kingdom.
[02:06] Considering you know the scope and clout
[02:08] that you have clearly on YouTube and in
[02:11] the podcast space um I consider myself
[02:15] um I don't know very
[02:19] small in your presence.
[02:23] Oh man, I I just got started a year ago.
[02:25] I I I can I consider myself still
[02:28] somewhat of a small player. Uh but I I
[02:31] guess that's always from you always feel
[02:33] a little bit like an imposter syndrome.
[02:34] you always feel a little bit like
[02:36] smaller than you actually are. Uh and
[02:38] you you would be surprised how many
[02:40] people say like, "Oh, I really like
[02:41] listening to this guy. He's he's asking
[02:43] good question. He has good points." Uh
[02:46] and I don't know how much how many how
[02:48] much you on conferences uh where you
[02:50] actually meet people that all of the
[02:52] sudden come up to you and like actually
[02:54] listen to the show, they watch it. Uh I
[02:56] even had people and this this is what I
[02:58] love the most when people come up to to
[03:00] me and say like, "Oh, you your show got
[03:02] me orange belt." And I'm like, that's
[03:04] that's the whole point of my show,
[03:06] getting new people to to Bitcoin. And
[03:08] yeah, there's a lot of like I I'm aware
[03:11] most of my listeners are actually
[03:13] already Bitcoiners because they I like
[03:15] they listen to Bitcoin podcast and then
[03:16] they find me. Uh and YouTube is really
[03:18] good in finding people that already like
[03:21] that kind of a content. So like
[03:23] Bitcoiners that already watch Bitcoin
[03:26] content are more likely to find my
[03:28] content. But there's here and there
[03:30] someone that just types in, hey, there's
[03:33] some maybe I want to learn about
[03:34] investing and then there's some topic
[03:36] with investing in stocks and Bitcoin and
[03:38] he stumbles upon one video. Maybe
[03:40] there's like Jeff Boo and me talking and
[03:42] then like oh like that sounds really
[03:43] interesting. I never heard that. And
[03:45] then like going down because I already
[03:46] have 500 episodes. So that that's what
[03:49] I'm really passionate about. uh finding
[03:51] new people that haven't discovered
[03:54] Bitcoin and uh kind of like oh like what
[03:57] what's that Bitcoin thing and then they
[03:58] can go down I think I don't know 500 600
[04:00] hours of of watch time on my channel
[04:03] now. Yeah. Yeah. Congratulations on on
[04:06] your success of your channel. Like doing
[04:08] it every day is that's a hell of a job,
[04:10] man. Um how are you coping with that?
[04:13] And why why did you decide to you
[04:17] obviously I'm making an assumption
[04:19] decided to go all in literally on your
[04:22] YouTube channel. So first of all well
[04:25] done. That's amazing. Second of all um
[04:28] what possessed you and are you mad?
[04:31] I I I definitely am. It's um the the
[04:35] reason why is a unfortunately very
[04:37] stupid reason but I will still tell you.
[04:40] Uh and then I can can maybe also go to
[04:42] the question of how am I I coping with
[04:45] that one. M um I started a podcast with
[04:49] the same idea in the head coming from IT
[04:53] security sales that when I write 10
[04:55] people I get like two messages back and
[04:58] I came into Bitcoin the Bitcoin
[05:00] podcasting world and was writing let's
[05:02] say I think it was 30 or 40 people that
[05:05] I wanted to have on the podcast at like
[05:07] the first 30 to 40 people uh and I was
[05:10] like okay maybe five to 10 people reply
[05:13] and then I have my first like 10
[05:14] episodes and I was surprised almost
[05:18] everyone replied and almost everyone I
[05:21] think it was like three or four people
[05:23] that did not reply and maybe like two or
[05:25] three people more that said like oh
[05:28] thank you so much for asking but
[05:29] currently I don't do podcasts h so I had
[05:32] after 40 outreach all all of the sudden
[05:35] 30 guests and with one podcast per week
[05:39] you have 30 weeks that's that's more
[05:41] than half a year of podcasts already. So
[05:45] I I kept pushing and writing people and
[05:48] all of the sudden I had months out
[05:51] planned. So I had logically uh to
[05:54] increase my frequency. I went from once
[05:56] a week to twice a week to three times a
[05:58] week. And then I said okay I will do now
[06:01] for one month every day and then I will
[06:04] go back to three four uh times a week.
[06:08] And this was this was the month where I
[06:10] really um shot up the first time. I got
[06:13] over thousand subscribers on YouTube.
[06:14] Jeff B was on. This was a really good
[06:17] month for my channel. And then I was
[06:19] like why I I just discovered something
[06:22] that is working. Why should I go back
[06:24] now? Uh and since then I'm I'm stuck
[06:27] with once once a day. And the bad thing
[06:30] is now everyone asks me about this why
[06:35] every day. And I did I researched
[06:37] actually I researched is another podcast
[06:41] not even about Bitcoin like is there
[06:43] another podcast that does an interview
[06:45] with a different person every single day
[06:49] and to this day I couldn't find any like
[06:51] I I couldn't just find any other podcast
[06:54] that does an interview podcast. So not
[06:56] solo episodes, not like a group that's
[06:59] always the same, but an interview
[07:01] podcast where every time a different
[07:02] guest on every single day, seven times a
[07:05] week. It's also funny because I say
[07:07] every day and a lot of people assume I
[07:09] do it five times a week. No, I do it
[07:11] like also Saturday, Sunday on Christmas,
[07:14] like Eastern, 365 days a year. So
[07:18] there's no there's no excuses. There's
[07:20] no like laying off or anything like
[07:22] that.
[07:24] uh and this is kind of accidentally
[07:28] become a unique branding of my podcast.
[07:32] So now I'm feeling I cannot take this
[07:34] away like this is now uh stuck with me
[07:39] and stuck with me in a positive way
[07:41] honestly and maybe at some point if I
[07:44] reach 2,000 3,000 4,000 episodes I might
[07:48] look into what it takes to get a
[07:50] Guinness World Record. Maybe I'm I I I
[07:53] started now a podcast where I
[07:55] realistically can get a Guinness World
[07:58] Record for the most interview podcast
[08:00] episodes ever recorded. That would be
[08:03] something cool. I I I I would definitely
[08:05] like that. This was not on my plan when
[08:07] I started the podcast. Uh but those
[08:09] things and how cool would it be if this
[08:12] podcast is a Bitcoin podcast that gets a
[08:14] Guinness World Record for that and like
[08:17] connected with with proof of work. So,
[08:20] uh, I'm I'm just, uh, I'm just a guy
[08:23] that that started a podcast and then all
[08:25] of a sudden did it all in because it was
[08:28] wellreceived and I really like it and I
[08:30] really like and and really enjoy talking
[08:32] with people about Bitcoin, but also
[08:35] about life in general. the podcast is
[08:37] about Bitcoin, but there's like 20 30%
[08:40] of the topics that where we are going
[08:42] into diet into sports and into other
[08:44] regions, but they're like I would say
[08:46] like 80% or something like that is
[08:48] Bitcoin talk uh and and finance talk and
[08:52] a little bit outside of that. So yeah,
[08:56] it's it's it's it's really good. And the
[08:58] second question is the the coping
[09:00] question. It is now really good. Uh
[09:05] honestly I have now uh an editor, I have
[09:07] a publishing team, I have basically
[09:09] three people, freelance, three
[09:11] freelancers that uh work with me on the
[09:14] podcast. So it's not just me anymore.
[09:16] Till February this year, till February
[09:18] 2025, it was just me every day, 60 70
[09:22] hours a week. Now I actually outsourced
[09:24] some of the uh important works. But it's
[09:28] still you have to record every week,
[09:31] every day. I don't record on Monday,
[09:34] Saturday and Sunday. That means I have
[09:36] to record on Tuesday till Friday two to
[09:40] three times per day also because
[09:42] sometimes on I'm on conferences then I
[09:43] don't record on conferences uh and and
[09:46] those things and then there's days where
[09:48] I just record four times in a row and
[09:51] the only uh let's say the only bad thing
[09:54] was previously when I did not had breaks
[09:57] when there was Saturday, Sunday and
[09:59] Monday also recordings then you're just
[10:01] in this constant recording loop and then
[10:04] there's maybe a down day where you don't
[10:05] feel like that good or you you're a
[10:07] little bit sick or like you're a little
[10:09] bit tired and this then shows in the
[10:11] podcast and this is not good. So I
[10:13] always want to be extremely fit. I want
[10:15] to be present in the moment and don't
[10:17] want to like half die in the podcast uh
[10:20] because then like why record a podcast
[10:23] if you're like so tired. So now I'm
[10:26] coping with it really good because I
[10:28] gave myself breathing room, relaxing
[10:31] room on Saturday, Sunday and Monday to
[10:34] do other things. I still work every day
[10:36] but uh it's a different if if you have
[10:39] to record uh you you
[10:43] you you're in a different mood. It's a
[10:45] different kind of a work. If you're just
[10:48] uh strategizing or you are writing
[10:50] something, you can do it on the couch
[10:52] also. If you are one day a little bit
[10:54] tired, you you can relax a little bit
[10:56] more with that sometimes. But if you're
[10:59] recording like it's it's that time and
[11:01] there's a guest and and and you have to
[11:03] be in front of the camera and all those
[11:07] things are a little bit more it it needs
[11:09] a little bit more social energy, but it
[11:11] in general needs more energy.
[11:15] Yeah, it takes a hell of a lot of energy
[11:17] to do what you're doing. Fair play. Um,
[11:19] I mean, I I work full-time and I do
[11:22] this. I've missed Well, I've been doing
[11:24] it for a year, but really took it
[11:26] seriously uh since Christmas and I
[11:29] record on a Friday, you know, 8:00 at
[11:32] night. It's not the best, but you got to
[11:34] try and shoehorn it in sometimes. And
[11:36] even doing this is like I mean, I know
[11:39] I've kind of say that I work full-time
[11:41] as well, but my god, this it's hard
[11:43] work. And especially when you've done
[11:45] the recording, it's like, "Okay, well,
[11:46] now I have to mess about with the
[11:48] editing and then upload it." And it is
[11:50] hard work, man. Um, it's no uh it's no
[11:52] easy feat by any means. And it's it's
[11:56] the things that people don't see because
[11:58] people see like one one and a half hours
[12:00] of podcast recording, maybe uh two hours
[12:03] of recording, but each hour of recording
[12:07] requires another 4 hours of
[12:10] post-prouction because we also do a
[12:12] trailer. So we have to find snippets.
[12:14] Then we also do clips, 20-minute clips
[12:16] for second channel. We do shorts under
[12:18] one minute for main and second channel.
[12:21] So there's a lot of distribution work
[12:23] and it's not only just YouTube, it's
[12:25] also going out on all the audio
[12:27] platforms. It's goes on Spotify also. It
[12:29] goes on Fountain. It goes on Twitter.
[12:31] Twitter there's like an introduction of
[12:33] 5 minutes. This goes out there. It's a
[12:36] again a different video. Then every
[12:39] platform needs a little bit of different
[12:40] title, a little bit of different
[12:42] description. Then there's like tags on
[12:44] YouTube, but on Spotify there are no
[12:46] tags. If you look in the detail, it's
[12:49] actually not that um trivial like oh
[12:51] like I record, I stop and I upload and
[12:54] that's it. Like there's a lot of work
[12:57] that goes into that in the process and
[12:58] the infrastructure. And then uh when
[13:01] once you're at a point where it runs so
[13:04] good that you uh make money from that
[13:06] and so you can outsource things from
[13:08] that then you have to deal with sponsors
[13:11] you have to uh keep them in the loop.
[13:13] Then you have to deal with um
[13:15] freelancers keep them organized. All of
[13:17] the sudden you're managing uh clients or
[13:20] like sponsors or partners however you
[13:21] want to call them and you have to uh
[13:24] manage freelancers and you go to
[13:26] conferences. I'm uh on May next week not
[13:30] next weekend I'm in Dublin then I come
[13:33] home have one day in Vienna then I fly
[13:35] to Las Vegas uh in the middle of the
[13:37] June I'm in in Prague then in July I'm
[13:40] at at two conferences so I'm also at one
[13:43] two conferences per per month and this
[13:46] is all just a
[13:49] podcast so I I'm I don't have a business
[13:52] I don't sell anything I don't have a
[13:54] book I don't have uh anything that I I
[13:57] sell. I don't have a service or anything
[14:00] else than than than the podcast. So,
[14:04] most podcasters uh also have something
[14:06] to sell like they have some kind of
[14:09] business model or they work at a
[14:10] business. I only have my my partners
[14:13] that support me. Uh so, uh if if I ever
[14:17] want to do also that, it's like founding
[14:20] another startup and making another
[14:23] another business out of that. Um, and
[14:26] and it's a lot. Um, but uh it's really
[14:31] fulfilling. You learn so much. I've I've
[14:33] learned I said that uh previous on a
[14:36] podcast, but I've learned in the last
[14:37] two years more than in the previous 20
[14:40] years.
[14:43] So, what got you into Bitcoin in the
[14:45] first place?
[14:48] The curiosity what to do with my money.
[14:51] Um I was always a really savings
[14:55] personality. I I have this one story
[14:57] where I was a small uh kid in in in
[15:01] undergraduate school. I don't know how
[15:03] it's called in the UK. Um but it
[15:05] basically I was what what I don't know 8
[15:07] 10 10 years old or something like that.
[15:09] And I got pocket money every day from my
[15:12] mom. And the interesting thing is I got
[15:15] I don't know what maybe €4. And from
[15:17] that four, I always took out one year or
[15:20] two to save a little bit each day to
[15:25] maybe uh and I I didn't even want to do
[15:28] buy anything. I I was a somewhat spoiled
[15:31] kid. I have had uh parents that if I
[15:34] really wanted something uh and needed
[15:36] it, then they gave it to me. If I needed
[15:39] a phone or I needed a a gaming console
[15:41] or anything like that, I I was not a
[15:43] poor child. Um but I I always saved uh
[15:49] for myself for some reason really
[15:52] intrinsically I knew I I had to uh save.
[15:55] So when I got to the age of 18 years old
[15:59] I already worked uh next to school. So I
[16:02] had a small job next to school where I
[16:03] worked and I did not have to pay rent. I
[16:06] did not have to pay anything else than
[16:09] uh what I wanted to do outside of the
[16:11] the normal things. So I basically saved
[16:15] 90% of my income which allowed me with
[16:19] 18 years old to already think about
[16:21] investing, think about savings and I
[16:24] started where everyone starts with a
[16:25] savings account at the bank. But then I
[16:28] quickly realized that's not good. Then I
[16:31] went into ETFs and fonts and then I was
[16:33] like it's also not that good. You you
[16:36] have a lot of fees. The developments are
[16:38] not that big. And I was like okay then
[16:40] individual stocks. I I looked into
[16:41] individual stocks and I was like, "Oh,
[16:43] that's interesting." I did that for I
[16:46] think three years, two three years. Uh
[16:48] and then with 21 years old, I found
[16:50] Bitcoin and this is basically uh because
[16:55] stocks went really good. People kept
[16:57] asking me about uh those that Bitcoin
[16:59] thing and I always said Bitcoin is for
[17:02] me a scam. Bitcoin is something that has
[17:05] no cash flow. Uh I was coming from the
[17:08] stock world. So if it has no cash flow,
[17:10] how can I how can I measure it? Like how
[17:13] do I know it's not a scam? Like the the
[17:15] greater fool
[17:16] theory. And with that in mind, uh I uh
[17:21] one day got a friend of mine who was not
[17:24] even in Bitcoin. He came to me, why are
[17:27] you not into Bitcoin? Like what's your
[17:29] reason? I told him my reasoning and he
[17:31] kept asking me even though he was not in
[17:33] Bitcoin. And I discovered that I don't
[17:35] have good arguments. So I told him wait
[17:38] uh this weekend I will do research and I
[17:40] will show you why Bitcoin is a
[17:42] scam. In in
[17:45] in trying to prove that Bitcoin is a
[17:48] scam Friday, Saturday and Sunday I
[17:51] discovered there might be something to
[17:53] Bitcoin like may maybe there is
[17:56] something that I've missed. So actually
[17:59] on Monday instead of writing my friend,
[18:02] hey this is a scam because of XY Z, I
[18:06] opened a Coinbase account and bought a
[18:08] ledger on on on day one. I had always
[18:10] self custody. I'm I'm really proud to
[18:12] say I have self custody from day one
[18:15] onwards and then uh I'm not proud that I
[18:18] chose a ledger and also not proud to to
[18:21] chose Coinbase but Coinbase. Yeah, at
[18:24] least I had self custody from day one.
[18:26] And uh this basically allowed me from uh
[18:31] uh to to learn a little bit about
[18:32] Bitcoin. I was still very skeptical. It
[18:34] was not that oh all of the sudden I I
[18:37] get Bitcoin and and and went all in. No,
[18:39] it took me about I would say a year from
[18:43] discovering Bitcoin to going all in. And
[18:46] this was quite a journey. You discover
[18:48] Bitcoin and you learn a little bit. And
[18:49] then there's this weekend where you uh
[18:53] go down three four podcasts. Then the
[18:55] next weekend it's like four or five
[18:56] podcasts and the next weekend it's like
[18:58] six, seven podcasts. You you go down
[19:00] that rabbit hole and it just keeps
[19:03] sucking you in more and more and more
[19:06] and more I got that idea of oh wait
[19:09] inflation might not be good. Is is is
[19:11] inflation a bad thing maybe? And then
[19:15] you get in the idea of okay gold
[19:18] apparently also is a good money. I I
[19:20] thought gold is bad. I when you I was in
[19:24] stock mine so deep in this one Buffett
[19:26] mindset so deep that I did not like
[19:29] gold. Through Bitcoin I learned the
[19:31] value of gold. So coming through that
[19:34] journey I learned more and more what
[19:37] Bitcoin actually is and what it
[19:40] represents and what monetary theory
[19:43] really is. It's also funny. I'm
[19:45] Austrian. I never heard about Austrian
[19:47] economics. And when I first got into
[19:49] Bitcoin, everyone was talking about
[19:51] Austrian economics. And I was like like
[19:53] like there's nothing interesting about
[19:56] Austria in economic sense. Like why are
[19:58] they talking about Austrian economics?
[20:00] Then I was googling it.
[20:02] Uh then I finally found out, oh, it's
[20:05] not about the current Austrian
[20:06] economics. And yeah, it just took me
[20:09] then one year to to get all in in
[20:12] Bitcoin. uh and got out of my Tesla
[20:14] position, got out of my Facebook
[20:16] position, got out of all my my stock
[20:18] portfolio positions, and I even uh
[20:21] wanted to get into real estate and
[20:24] completely went out of uh out of that. I
[20:27] I I never really went into real estate,
[20:29] but Bitcoin kind of prevented me to
[20:32] diversify in in real estate before I
[20:35] discovered Bitcoin. I slowly slowly
[20:38] planned of acquiring my first small real
[20:40] estate property to rent it out as an
[20:42] investment uh property. And luckily I
[20:45] never did that otherwise I would have a
[20:48] lot of headache with with with uh
[20:51] tenants and then and all those things
[20:53] and repairing toilets and whatever
[20:55] you're doing with with with when you're
[20:57] uh when you are a landlord.
[21:00] Yeah. So you're 100% Bitcoin then? Yes.
[21:04] And this is something that I actually
[21:06] did I think just two months ago.
[21:09] Um I also now earn in bitcoin through a
[21:13] bitcoin podcast. I have bitcoin
[21:15] partners. This allows me to directly
[21:17] earn in bitcoin. Uh so from company
[21:21] directly to me without any third parties
[21:23] in between and I have a small percentage
[21:26] like one of the three freelancers are
[21:28] payrolls in bitcoin. So there's a
[21:29] percentage that I earn in Bitcoin and
[21:32] and a percentage that I earn in fiat.
[21:34] Then there's a small percentage that I
[21:36] pay in Bitcoin and a small and a big
[21:38] percentage that they pay in fiat which
[21:42] uh forces me to spend bitcoin every
[21:44] month. I have to sell Bitcoin basically
[21:46] every month, which hurts, but uh you
[21:50] have to come to the realization it's not
[21:53] about buying or selling Bitcoin. It's
[21:55] about getting a little bit more sats
[21:58] every month. It it does not matter if
[22:00] you it does not matter if you buy 2,000
[22:04] Satoshi this month or you buy 10,000
[22:08] Satoshi and sell 8,000. It's it's the
[22:10] same freaking thing. Uh, but this was
[22:13] really hard for me to come over that I
[22:16] can spend my Bitcoin that I it's okay to
[22:20] press a sell button. I don't have to
[22:23] uh I don't have to now go into depth and
[22:27] have a big credit line. Uh I I can
[22:30] really just spend the Bitcoin that I
[22:32] earn because Bitcoin is money and it's
[22:34] supposed to be used as money. So yes,
[22:36] I'm 100% in Bitcoin. I have a overdraft
[22:40] bank account. So whenever I have to
[22:42] spend, I go in overdraft. End of the
[22:44] month, I'm paying off the overdraft with
[22:46] with the money I earn.
[22:49] Yeah. Okay. I see
[22:51] that. Is
[22:53] um how how do the government in
[22:56] Austria or the banks are they dovish on
[22:59] Bitcoin transactions or do you find that
[23:02] there's a bit of friction with it?
[23:04] Cuz over here in the UK, it's it's
[23:07] really really difficult to try and
[23:09] transact in Bitcoin. Not that anybody
[23:10] really spends Bitcoin in the UK. Um, but
[23:14] it's it's kind of hard and we have had a
[23:16] lot of friction with banks uh closing
[23:19] down accounts and just making it
[23:21] generally very very difficult.
[23:24] There are two sides to the to the story.
[23:26] The one side is I'm at a challenger
[23:29] bank. I'm at a bank that is quite new.
[23:32] Uh it's not a bank that's there for
[23:35] hundreds of years. The bank was founded
[23:37] I think 10 years ago. uh it has the
[23:39] normal bank license and everything like
[23:41] that but uh when you look at the uh
[23:44] management team there are one or two
[23:45] bitcoiners or crypto people in there so
[23:48] they're a little bit more open to the
[23:49] idea you can buy and sell bitcoin at
[23:51] that bank also even though you cannot
[23:53] withdraw it but at least you they have
[23:55] the option to buy and sell bitcoin and
[23:57] other cryptos so they are quite they are
[24:01] completely normal with it they they if
[24:03] there's a bitcoin in the transaction
[24:05] description they don't uh do anything
[24:07] fishy with that and I never had any
[24:09] problems. I have third party tools like
[24:12] Bull Bitcoin and bringing in where I can
[24:15] go from my hardware wallet to um to uh
[24:21] my fiat bank account N26 I use in within
[24:25] 5 minutes. So basically bringing in for
[24:28] example gives me an bitcoin invoice. I
[24:30] pay that bitcoin invoice. They
[24:32] converting it to fiat euros and then
[24:35] with instant saper I get the money on my
[24:37] bank account. So I can convert on my
[24:40] self custody setup to my fiat bank
[24:43] account bitcoin uh no matter what the
[24:46] amount is directly to my bank account
[24:48] with no friction at all on Sunday
[24:51] afternoon or evening which is amazing.
[24:53] So actually in that sense uh Bitcoin and
[24:58] the fiat banking system works really
[24:59] good together. Like that's the one part
[25:02] of the story but there's another part of
[25:04] the story. I worked in Germany for one
[25:09] and a half years and there uh my I got
[25:13] to know that my bank account the the
[25:16] same bank account from N26 is flagged
[25:20] because apparently
[25:22] um my bank account does not discriminate
[25:24] me but other bank accounts discriminate
[25:28] me. So when my employer in the first
[25:31] month wanted to pay me, I said to him,
[25:34] "Oh, I did not get my money." And he's
[25:35] like, "Oh, that's weird. I I I gave it
[25:38] to you." And then um they they looked at
[25:40] the transaction. It it failed. And they
[25:42] called the bank of like, "Hey, why did
[25:44] this transaction fail?" And the bank
[25:46] told them, "Yeah, that's a fishy uh bank
[25:50] account you're transferring money to,
[25:52] and we won't allow that." And it's for
[25:55] your protection. It's for your
[25:57] protection. And the CEO said, "I know
[25:59] this guy. He works for me. Please
[26:02] transfer money. Otherwise, I'm not
[26:05] legally like he work for me. He needs
[26:08] money." Then eventually they um made an
[26:12] exception. So you they like, "Okay, if
[26:14] you fill out that form and give a
[26:15] signature that you really like to send
[26:17] him money, then you can send him money."
[26:19] So I got to know that I because of my
[26:23] Bitcoin activities got flagged. I never
[26:26] got really into problems because of
[26:27] that. It just was a little bit
[26:30] inconvenient. My my boss is a really
[26:33] cool one and he knows about all the
[26:34] Bitcoin things. Uh my previous boss I I
[26:37] don't have anymore of course. Um and and
[26:41] he was just asking, oh like do do you do
[26:43] anything outside of Bitcoin also or just
[26:45] just buying Bitcoin? I was like just
[26:47] buying Bitcoin. Uh so I personally never
[26:50] got really into troubles. But I would
[26:53] say that from that from those two um uh
[26:57] stories I just told choose your bank
[27:00] wisely like find a bank that is a little
[27:04] bit more modern, a little bit newer.
[27:06] There are banks that offer Bitcoin and
[27:08] crypto. Just use them like like go go go
[27:11] for those bank that actually support the
[27:14] mission. embrace Bitcoin and crypto and
[27:16] with those you will have less problems.
[27:18] I'm not saying you have zero problems as
[27:20] as I told you I had problems small one
[27:22] but still and I think that's where the
[27:25] game theory also starts because there
[27:27] are younger banks there are modern banks
[27:29] there's uh community banks that already
[27:32] embrace it also in Germany there's the
[27:34] uh forks bank by midter and they are not
[27:38] only embracing bitcoin you can buy and
[27:40] sell bitcoin there they even holding one
[27:43] of the biggest German bitcoin only
[27:46] conferences in Germany they're like
[27:48] thousand people there and they they
[27:50] support that that whole thing and they
[27:52] they are normal community bank that's
[27:54] there for what what is it hundreds of
[27:57] years something like that it's it's a
[27:58] really normal kind of community bank but
[28:02] it's only one region it's not the whole
[28:04] bank of of of of Germany so there are
[28:08] instances of fiat banks that are really
[28:11] friendly to to Bitcoin and I'm just
[28:14] saying find those banks give them your
[28:17] money if you have to give them your
[28:18] money. But if you like if you go
[28:20] completely out of fiat, that's best
[28:22] case. But if you have to interact with
[28:24] the fiat system, try to interact with
[28:26] those people who get Bitcoin. And that's
[28:29] the whole game theory because if all the
[28:31] customers going to those banks, the
[28:33] other banks will be like, "Oh [ __ ] we
[28:34] are losing customers because we do not
[28:36] offer Bitcoin." They will wake up. They
[28:40] will wake up. If they if the CFO of the
[28:43] bank says, "Why we keep losing
[28:45] customers? Why? Why? Why is our customer
[28:48] numbers going down and down and down and
[28:50] down? Then they are asking customers why
[28:52] they're leaving the Bitcoin. I guess we
[28:55] have to offer that now. So, uh I I I
[28:59] encourage everyone vote with their feet
[29:01] uh and leave the banks that don't treat
[29:04] you good because most likely there's a
[29:06] bank that treats you good. Yeah. It's
[29:09] interesting that Germany
[29:11] are kind of embracing it. Um because you
[29:14] would think and this is from my perhaps
[29:18] biased or skewed point of
[29:20] view about the German culture is they
[29:24] seem to be very
[29:28] um what's the word I'm looking for?
[29:30] Uptight is the wrong word. But like
[29:32] they're
[29:33] really bureaucratic or structured. And
[29:36] then to to
[29:37] to throw in a red herring like Bitcoin
[29:40] into that banking system, you just sort
[29:43] of think, oh, that's a bit ungermanlike.
[29:45] But, you know, clearly they're well,
[29:47] they clearly far more on board than the
[29:49] UK. It's it's absolute nightmare over
[29:52] here at the moment. Um, and I think it's
[29:54] only going to get worse.
[29:56] Um, I think in Germany,
[29:59] um, sorry, just a quick, uh, quick note.
[30:02] I think in Germany the difference
[30:05] between the grassroots movement, how far
[30:07] we already are versus how bad the
[30:11] politicians get it, the divergence
[30:14] between those is the biggest in the
[30:16] whole
[30:17] world. It's like, yeah, in America
[30:19] grassroots is good, but also there's
[30:21] Trump that at least talks about it and
[30:24] goes to conferences. The vice president
[30:25] will be in that in in in Las Vegas.
[30:29] So this moves kind of simultaneously
[30:32] where people in in uh grassroots ma uh
[30:36] grassroots get it but also politicians
[30:38] slowly slowly get it. Germany and
[30:40] politicians like really dislike it for
[30:43] some reason. But the Kosus movement is
[30:45] really good and that's how the banks uh
[30:47] start treating it like there's like one
[30:49] regional bank that fully embraced it and
[30:51] has that that event. But that's just
[30:53] because one guy uh orange build the
[30:57] people in in those small regional bank
[30:59] and they they embrace it and this is a
[31:01] old bank where every region has their
[31:04] own CEOs. It's not like centrally
[31:06] controlled and uh Germany has one of the
[31:09] highest numbers of full node operators.
[31:12] Germany is really big on those
[31:14] engineering uh engineering things. So
[31:18] the grassroots movement is is really
[31:20] strong. The meetup culture in Germany is
[31:22] is crazy for there are so many meetups
[31:26] in every small town you can find a
[31:29] meetup because they're organized and
[31:30] they're doing all those things is also
[31:32] happening in other countries. But uh
[31:34] I've I've seen and I'm in Austria. Uh so
[31:37] so I I can see a little bit um uh in the
[31:40] in Germany a little bit more. There's a
[31:43] really big grassroots movement in
[31:46] Germany because they are
[31:48] so there I think there's a big big
[31:52] movement that is really upset with how
[31:55] uptight
[31:56] uh the systems are, how bureaucratic the
[31:59] systems are and how bad the the system
[32:02] is. And I think that's makes it actually
[32:04] a good good starting point uh for for
[32:07] Bitcoiners uh to to grow. That's why I
[32:09] interrupted you. No, no, it's fine.
[32:11] That's fine. Um I mean, I get it. It
[32:13] served a purpose, you know, since since
[32:15] World War II. That's what made Germany
[32:18] what it is today. This this in
[32:20] incredibly powerful economic um
[32:23] behemoth. Uh but it's clearly not what's
[32:26] going to get them to where they need to
[32:28] be in the future. It's interesting the
[32:29] way you describe some of those things
[32:31] then that the leaders of the countries
[32:36] or these governments that are supposed
[32:39] to be the spearhead of the development
[32:42] of a country whether it be the
[32:44] government or big banks actually
[32:47] are very much in
[32:50] tow with populist move populist yeah
[32:55] populist movements such as Bitcoin. they
[32:57] tend to follow rather than lead. But you
[32:59] would think that
[33:00] actually especially with the you know
[33:03] German engineering being what it
[33:05] is that these banks and governments
[33:08] would lead the court the the charge on
[33:10] this but it's it's doesn't work that way
[33:12] at all. It does not. I mean Germany has
[33:16] an interesting law still which I really
[33:18] like. Uh every bitcoin you hold longer
[33:21] than one year is taxfree.
[33:23] Maybe they still have that that's that's
[33:26] really Bitcoin friendly I would say and
[33:28] it's in the Bitcoin ethos if you hold
[33:31] Bitcoin for the long run and one year is
[33:32] not even that long uh you you get it tax
[33:35] free uh so there is it they're selling
[33:40] Bitcoin
[33:42] uh famously the 50,000 Bitcoin they sold
[33:45] I think I don't know around uh 60,000 or
[33:49] $50,000
[33:51] uh what what was the price around that
[33:52] time so definitely made a huge huge loss
[33:55] with that. Um, but
[33:59] the the laws are not that bad for
[34:01] Bitcoiners in Germany. And the
[34:04] grassroots movement is amazing. And
[34:05] there are so many Bitcoin pizza days.
[34:07] There's literally even in in Vienna, I
[34:10] saw three different Bitcoin pizza day
[34:13] events in Vienna in in one city and it's
[34:16] just uh 1 million people here. So, it's
[34:18] not not that big of a city if you see
[34:21] other really really big cities. is I
[34:22] mean a million people is depending on
[34:25] where you are can be a quite big city.
[34:30] It does make you wonder what's going
[34:31] through the minds of our politicians in
[34:33] the UK. Um like we've got 62,000
[34:37] Bitcoin.
[34:39] Um you know through asset
[34:41] seizures but our government are just not
[34:44] even interested in having a conversation
[34:46] about it. You know, we've got two people
[34:48] from Bitcoin Policy UK, um, Freddy New
[34:51] and and Susie Ward, who do an incredible
[34:54] job, and they try to engage in
[34:59] in with politicians in trying to talk
[35:02] about these things, but they just
[35:03] they're just completely uninterested. I
[35:06] don't know whether it's because of the
[35:08] type of government that we have right
[35:11] now. Maybe that's going to change at the
[35:13] next election. I don't know.
[35:15] But
[35:17] if if what I'm led to believe is how
[35:20] this thing plays
[35:22] out, you would think that every
[35:24] government would be fighting each other
[35:27] tooth and nail to get as much of this
[35:28] stuff as they possibly
[35:30] can. Now, I don't know if
[35:34] it's lack of education or stupidity.
[35:38] What do you think? I think we're early.
[35:42] Um, I think we are definitely in a
[35:45] bubble. When you look at Bitcoin
[35:46] podcasters like myself and you talk
[35:49] every day with a different Bitcoiner,
[35:52] you have that bias that oh, Bitcoin will
[35:55] break out tomorrow and everyone will get
[35:56] it. Um, we we we all experience that
[36:01] once we get Bitcoin all of the we get
[36:03] this fear of missing out of of like I
[36:06] want to get more Bitcoin. Oh [ __ ] like
[36:08] what if it shoots up like crazy
[36:10] tomorrow? How can I save my finances?
[36:14] How can I save the finances of my
[36:15] family, of my company, of my
[36:18] whatever? But then you realize it takes
[36:21] a while. People don't uh read about
[36:25] Bitcoin and all of the sudden they are
[36:26] maxes. It's it it takes some time that
[36:28] they they get Bitcoin. I heard the first
[36:31] time I heard Bitcoin was 2017. The first
[36:34] time I bought Bitcoin was 2020. And then
[36:37] I went all in in 2021. So it took me
[36:40] four years from first time hearing to
[36:43] actually going full in on
[36:46] Bitcoin. And four years is quite some
[36:49] time. So people that now hear it and now
[36:52] slowly get into this, they need some
[36:54] years to to get really used to it. It we
[36:57] this is an early process that that we
[36:59] currently in and this will take some
[37:02] time. We always think oh because we are
[37:04] now connected and we have now WhatsApp
[37:07] on our phone we now have uh Facebook,
[37:10] YouTube, Reddit and all those platforms
[37:12] where we can fast interact with each
[37:14] other and faster communicate with each
[37:16] other. I mean we have now AI. It makes
[37:18] it so much easier to research things. Uh
[37:20] you could you could learn what the
[37:23] essence of Bitcoin is with AI super
[37:25] super fast and and really good. at all.
[37:28] So, I tried that actually going with an
[37:30] AI that doesn't know me and and playing
[37:33] dumb and it actually got me really good
[37:34] answers um better than Google honestly.
[37:38] So, um I think we will see a faster and
[37:42] faster
[37:43] development.
[37:44] But even though communication and all
[37:47] those things that I just described are
[37:50] better and way faster, we still have the
[37:53] same brains. We still have the same
[37:56] human brains that needs time to
[37:59] process new information, that needs time
[38:02] to process change. And we see it with
[38:04] all different kind of innovations. We
[38:07] see it with the printing press. We saw
[38:09] it with electricity. We saw it with the
[38:11] the internet. There are people that
[38:15] looked at the internet and said, "Oh,
[38:17] this will this will go away. That's
[38:19] that's just a FUD." They said, "Oh, why
[38:23] do we why do we need this electricity?"
[38:26] There was anti-ele electricity
[38:28] propaganda. There was people say, "When
[38:30] we have
[38:32] electricity, everything will burn down.
[38:34] The whole world will fall
[38:37] apart." And electricity was a lot more
[38:40] dangerous to implement than it is
[38:43] Bitcoin. So there's a lot more risk
[38:46] associated, actual physical risk with
[38:49] building out the infrastructure for
[38:51] electricity than building out the
[38:53] infrastructure for Bitcoin. And still
[38:56] people really hate Bitcoin. People
[38:58] really don't get Bitcoin. They feel
[39:00] threatened by it. Not because it
[39:02] threatens them, because everyone will be
[39:04] better off on Bitcoin, but because it's
[39:07] new, because it's a paradigm shift. It's
[39:10] it's a fork in the road. It's it's the
[39:12] same fork in the road that uh the
[39:15] electricity was, the fire was, the uh
[39:17] the the wheel was like every innovation
[39:20] ever in human history was a fork in the
[39:24] road. And there were those who took that
[39:26] fork earlier than others. And those who
[39:28] took it earlier embraced it and didn't
[39:30] ignore it, they really got all the
[39:34] benefits from that because they embraced
[39:36] it earlier. All the companies that
[39:38] embraced the internet and really uh
[39:42] stickked with it like Google, Apple,
[39:45] Amazon, Microsoft, they are now the big
[39:47] companies and those companies that now
[39:50] embrace Bitcoin will be the big
[39:52] companies. I mean strategy they look at
[39:55] strategy from 2020 to now what did they
[39:58] do? They embrace Bitcoin nothing else.
[40:01] They just embrace Bitcoin. They are so
[40:04] much bigger. So much bigger. I don't
[40:07] know the multiple actually, but it's uh
[40:10] so much bigger that it's ridiculous how
[40:13] much bigger strategy uh back in the day
[40:16] micro strategy was from 2020 to now.
[40:20] There was this micro strategy was
[40:21] already there in the com bubble and they
[40:24] went down like crazy. They actually
[40:26] climbed that ladder up and they're now
[40:28] way higher even in the peak of the
[40:31] 2000.com bubble. So those companies who
[40:36] embrace new technology will those be
[40:38] those companies that will rule the world
[40:41] tomorrow. And the same thing for
[40:43] individuals, the same thing for nation
[40:46] states.
[40:47] And we can only hope that the nation
[40:50] state we are living in embraces it
[40:52] Bitcoin at some point. If not, we might
[40:55] have to consider the move because the
[40:57] companies and know the countries that
[40:59] embrace it earlier and sooner, they will
[41:02] get all the capital and they will get
[41:04] all the talent and they will be way
[41:07] better countries to live in than those
[41:09] countries who don't. And now the race
[41:13] started with 1095. For me, the official
[41:15] race for nation state started. It's a
[41:17] slow race. It's way slower than
[41:19] companies.
[41:21] And as the race for uh company adoption
[41:25] started in 2020 with strategy, now the
[41:28] nation state adoption really started. We
[41:31] we have literally the USA calling
[41:34] Bitcoin a strategic asset. This I I hear
[41:38] people saying, "Oh, it's just a name.
[41:40] They did not do anything except the
[41:42] name." The name matters. It matters how
[41:45] they look at it. It matters how they
[41:48] frame what Bitcoin is. Now, of course,
[41:50] we have to see, do they actually also
[41:52] write it in law? Because because an
[41:54] executive order is good because it's
[41:56] quick here, but it's also bad because
[41:58] it's quickly gone. If there's another
[42:00] president coming, it's gone tomorrow. If
[42:02] if the president wants executive orders,
[42:05] I quickly do reverse. But if it's
[42:07] written in law, it's very hard to get it
[42:10] out. If that law, the bill from Cindas
[42:13] actually passes, it's really hard to get
[42:15] it out. Even if we get uh I don't know
[42:18] uh um I forgot how this AOC uh
[42:22] administration next term. I don't think
[42:23] so. I think we get JD Vance probably.
[42:25] But if we get AOC, it will be very hard
[42:29] for her to get it out. And in four
[42:31] years, the amount of lobbying Bitcoiners
[42:35] will do in Washington DC, the amount of
[42:39] force that Bitcoiners will have as a
[42:41] political
[42:43] power, it's there. It's not reversible.
[42:46] You like every day is a new every day a
[42:48] new Bitcoiner gets born. So it's not
[42:51] something that you can get out again of
[42:53] of of of
[42:54] people. So we have now this uh nation
[42:59] race started and we'll see how how it
[43:02] goes. The the first people uh already
[43:04] started running and
[43:06] it's imagine there is a tree with with
[43:10] some apples and and and people are like
[43:12] oh are those apples good? At some point,
[43:14] one guy stands up and like, "Oh, let's
[43:17] let's run there. Let's see if the apple
[43:19] is good." He picks up the first apple.
[43:21] He buys the apple. He does not die. He's
[43:23] like, "Oh, that's a really good apple."
[43:25] At some point, someone else is like,
[43:26] "Oh, I also want an apple." But there
[43:28] are only so many apples on the apple
[43:30] tree. So, if you if you're not running
[43:32] as fast as possible to the apple tree,
[43:34] yeah, you might have to wait till a new
[43:36] apple comes along. And the the world
[43:39] with apple trees is a better world than
[43:42] the world without apple trees. So even
[43:45] the last nation state, even the last
[43:47] person adopting Bitcoin will benefit
[43:50] from it. But it's better to be number
[43:53] two, not number 200 in the nation state,
[43:56] right?
[43:58] Yeah.
[44:00] Yeah. It's
[44:03] um it goes it's our lizard brain, isn't
[44:06] it? We're afraid of everything. You
[44:07] know, how long did it take us to come
[44:08] from, you know, to get out the cave?
[44:11] Thousands of years, I'm sure. How long
[44:12] did it take us
[44:14] to, you
[44:16] know, use the wheel and and create
[44:19] carts? Uh, you know, that old fear-based
[44:23] mindset is
[44:24] is I mean, it's kept us alive as a
[44:27] species, but it's also perhaps held us
[44:29] back quite a lot.
[44:31] I I was thinking the other day about
[44:35] how is the adoption of Bitcoin the
[44:39] beginning of the fourth industrial re
[44:40] revolution? I think it possibly could
[44:43] be. Bitcoin coupled with AI and the
[44:46] potential abundance of energy production
[44:48] that we could see in the next 20 50
[44:51] years. Um do you think we're on the cusp
[44:54] of the fourth industrial re revolution?
[44:57] Yeah, like however you want to call it,
[44:59] we are already seeing a whole new world.
[45:04] It's slowly getting started. We have now
[45:07] a borderless money with Bitcoin where I
[45:11] already see it from a company
[45:14] um let's say there is a company in
[45:17] Paraguay, they can send me money and I
[45:20] have a freelancer working in Colombia, I
[45:22] can send them money and I'm in Austria.
[45:25] It does not matter like it's it's just
[45:27] Bitcoin. It's just an Bitcoin address.
[45:29] It company borders all of the sudden
[45:31] doesn't matter anymore. I have one uh
[45:34] editor in chief that uh cuts my
[45:37] podcasts. So I pay him in fiat still. I
[45:41] guess at some point he will also demand
[45:43] Bitcoin. But as as long as he demands
[45:45] fiat, I will pay him in fiat. But it's a
[45:47] lot more complicated. I have to get a
[45:49] lot more information from him. I have to
[45:51] get his address, like his physical
[45:53] address. and all this information. I
[45:54] have like 10 or 12 things that I have to
[45:57] fill out to make that possible. And then
[46:00] I have to pay fees. I have to pay uh
[46:02] what is it? I think 56 per transaction
[46:05] plus he has to then also pay 56 on his
[46:09] side. Uh I just made a Bitcoin
[46:12] transaction a week ago and I
[46:15] paid.7 and the recipient didn't pay
[46:18] anything. I mean, he got the money like
[46:20] he doesn't he doesn't pay anything to
[46:22] get money. So, Bitcoin is already way
[46:27] more efficient as remittance uh money,
[46:29] but it's also way more efficient to get
[46:31] a burger if you have lightning. It's
[46:33] it's so so so easy. And this is the one
[46:37] thing we have to borderless money, but
[46:39] there are more things to it. I think to
[46:41] the new uh workplace there are basically
[46:44] three different um very important
[46:48] innovations and the first thing I just
[46:50] mentioned it's the borderless money the
[46:53] second thing is borderless work you can
[46:57] now go ahead and as like I have someone
[47:00] in El Salvador and someone in Colombia
[47:02] working for me it doesn't matter because
[47:05] we have one system they can log in those
[47:08] systems and we have remote uh tools like
[47:12] Google Meets or Zoom or whatever you're
[47:14] using. We are now working together on a
[47:16] live stream or like on a on a recording
[47:19] and we don't we are not in the same
[47:20] country. You are in the UK, I'm in in
[47:23] Austria and we can work together. We can
[47:25] collaborate. We don't have to be in the
[47:26] same room and have a camera there and it
[47:29] works really good. I understand you
[47:30] good. Like there's no there's no uh lag
[47:33] in in there at all. And this will only
[47:36] get better. We we we might have we are
[47:39] um headsets on and it actually feels
[47:41] like we are in the in the same room. Uh
[47:44] even though um I don't know how good
[47:46] this is, it is it is the completely
[47:50] elimination of of borders of of uh
[47:54] having limitations around where where to
[47:56] work. So we have limitless borderless
[47:59] money. We have borderless uh work and we
[48:03] have a game theory around the nations
[48:07] that have to compete now because of the
[48:09] first two things game theory around the
[48:12] nation states that have to compete for
[48:14] all the talents and for all the people
[48:16] because if all the best people can get
[48:19] their capital in bitcoin and just move
[48:22] around and they don't have to do
[48:23] anything like if if I go over the
[48:26] borders with my bitcoin you even know
[48:28] that I have bitcoin I might should
[48:29] change the shirt and don't have a
[48:31] Bitcoin symbol on on the shirt. Uh but
[48:33] they don't know if I have Bitcoin or
[48:35] not, then uh if if I can work remotely
[48:38] like I let's go back to the the editor.
[48:43] Uh he is now in Colombia. Maybe he's not
[48:46] like I don't know. I don't know where he
[48:48] is. He could be somewhere else. Uh it's
[48:50] it's it's just that uh he he works and
[48:53] he does his work amazingly. He does a
[48:55] really good job and that's all that
[48:57] matters, right? like who who cares who
[49:00] where this person is. Um so I I think uh
[49:05] those two things will then accelerate
[49:07] the movement towards um uh nation states
[49:11] having to compete for the best talent
[49:14] because if I can freely choose with my
[49:16] capital and my work wherever I want to
[49:18] go and I'm not bound by any imaginary
[49:22] borders you can go to the place that
[49:24] treats you best that treats your Bitcoin
[49:26] best that treats your taxes best that
[49:28] treats your environment the best uh
[49:31] looks out for the country the best way
[49:34] and uh there will be things like hey in
[49:37] this country I pay a little bit more
[49:38] taxes but they have parks and they are
[49:41] really clean and there is a really nice
[49:42] country I like to live there okay I can
[49:45] pay a little bit more to live in that
[49:46] country or I want to pay less taxes oh
[49:48] then I go to this country okay it's not
[49:50] that clean they don't have that
[49:52] beautiful of parks but I I save on the
[49:54] taxes so you have a a game theory going
[49:57] on and I think those are the three
[49:59] things Um, no matter if you call it the
[50:01] fourth uh industrial revolution uh or
[50:04] the or whatever you want to call that
[50:07] thing, I think it's the vision of the
[50:09] sovereign individual in the end of the
[50:11] day. Uh those three things together
[50:14] really make a difference and Bitcoin is
[50:17] the most important of them all. Money,
[50:20] if money is not free, then it does not
[50:23] matter. Like you you can have remote
[50:25] work, you can have
[50:28] uh re
[50:30] augmented reality, Zoom calls, whatever.
[50:33] If if you cannot freely choose where you
[50:36] get your capital, you still have those
[50:38] imaginary borders that that put you in
[50:41] those in that corner. But those sheeps
[50:44] get get wings with Bitcoin because all
[50:47] of the sudden we have those wings with
[50:50] Bitcoin and remote work and we can go
[50:52] wherever we want to go.
[50:56] thinking about what you're saying, the
[50:57] the free movement of people enabled
[51:01] by
[51:03] Bitcoin, one of the questions I was
[51:05] going to talk to you about was the
[51:08] demonetization of an asset class. So,
[51:11] I'm just trying to join up some some
[51:12] dots here. If Bitcoin enables free move
[51:16] free movement of
[51:17] people and there's a there's a strong
[51:22] uh bet that Bitcoin is going to
[51:24] demonetize asset
[51:26] classes, do you think that property
[51:28] becomes one of the first asset classes
[51:30] that gets demonetized by Bitcoin and
[51:32] people can then purchase
[51:35] houses the way they were supposed to be
[51:38] purchased as as somewhere to live rather
[51:41] than, you know, somewhere that you put
[51:43] your pension because I think
[51:47] obviously the fiat currency
[51:50] has
[51:52] undermined
[51:54] bastardized the property market
[51:56] completely. Let's take a break for a
[51:58] moment and appreciate the be put that
[52:01] coin vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[52:04] watches. Those watches are the most
[52:07] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[52:10] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[52:13] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[52:16] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[52:19] watch collections. You have the date of
[52:21] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[52:25] there. And of course, also the block
[52:27] height and which epoch we are currently
[52:30] in. I love the level of detail they put
[52:33] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[52:36] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[52:38] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[52:41] love those watches so so much. And now,
[52:44] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[52:47] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[52:49] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[52:50] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[52:53] first way is you put it on a hardware
[52:55] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[52:58] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[53:01] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[53:04] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[53:07] if you check out the link in the
[53:08] description, you even get 5% off if you
[53:11] use the code Robin. And the second way
[53:14] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[53:17] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[53:20] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[53:23] They will personalize for you a
[53:26] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[53:28] your individual situation. They will
[53:31] show you how you can secure your own
[53:33] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[53:36] enough. You also have to keep all your
[53:38] devices secure. One topic that is
[53:40] overlooked often is the inheritance
[53:43] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[53:46] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[53:48] a plan for that in place already? And
[53:51] last but not least, if you're in a
[53:52] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[53:55] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[53:57] that, head over to the
[54:01] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[54:04] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[54:07] be for the first time ever speaking at
[54:09] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[54:12] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[54:15] really looking forward to seeing all of
[54:17] you there. You can get your ticket in
[54:19] the link down in the description of
[54:22] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[54:24] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[54:28] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[54:29] there. When you look at housing and and
[54:32] the the house price in the last 5 to 10
[54:34] years, they have been consistently going
[54:37] up. when you uh measured in the fiat
[54:39] local terms in the fiat local currencies
[54:42] they have been going up five 10 maybe
[54:45] 15% where depending on the region and
[54:47] and where you where where you are but
[54:50] then if you flip that and measure that
[54:52] in Bitcoin demonetization already
[54:55] started I
[54:58] um what was the numbers five years ago I
[55:02] think I've got the numbers right five
[55:03] years ago in the US a typical house
[55:06] costed 36 bitcoin. Now it's like five
[55:09] bitcoin, six bitcoin maybe depending on
[55:12] on on the region and in in five 10 more
[55:16] years maybe it's one bitcoin, maybe it's
[55:18] 0.5 bitcoin. So the demonetization
[55:21] already started it and it's all asset
[55:23] classes. If you denominate your wealth
[55:26] in bitcoin, everything else gets
[55:28] cheaper. And that's something so
[55:31] simple, but you really have to to feel
[55:36] that. I think we we as Bitcoiner, we say
[55:39] quickly, oh yeah, like you denominate
[55:42] things in Bitcoin and you save in
[55:44] Bitcoin and and all the other things get
[55:46] cheaper. But we don't feel that until we
[55:49] really get it. Imagine someone buying uh
[55:53] two years ago five bitcoin. They have
[55:56] those five bitcoin. That's a life
[55:58] savings. That's all they got. Now they
[56:01] needed they need all their stack to buy
[56:04] one home. They needed five bitcoins to
[56:06] buy their home. Then they just save.
[56:09] They get a little bit more bitcoin.
[56:10] Maybe they get up to like 5.5 bitcoin.
[56:13] They have a conservative job. They they
[56:15] can just earn a little bit more uh each
[56:18] year, but they maybe get to 5.5 or six
[56:21] bitcoin over the next 5 10 years.
[56:25] They don't have a lot more Bitcoin.
[56:27] They're like five Bitcoin to six Bitcoin
[56:29] is not that big of a step. But what if
[56:32] they can now purchase a home for one
[56:34] Bitcoin? All of a sudden it's not all
[56:37] their stack, it's just 20% or 18% of
[56:41] their stack and they can buy a house
[56:42] with that. Then they wait another 10
[56:44] years and all of a sudden it's 0.2
[56:46] Bitcoin for a house. And they're like,
[56:48] "Oh wow." Like all of a sudden I just
[56:51] have to wait. I just have I I just don't
[56:54] have I if I keep the same Bitcoin that I
[56:57] already have at some point I can I can
[56:58] buy a house with that. That's the thing
[57:01] that people then really get where and
[57:05] they really the they feel the prices
[57:07] going down and this will really come
[57:10] into place when a lot of people and they
[57:13] all now coming in they all came coming
[57:15] in in the past cycles can all of a
[57:17] sudden buy houses in in five 10 10 years
[57:20] because they got demonetized. so much.
[57:22] And uh this this will be this will be an
[57:25] amazing thing for for Bitcoiners to
[57:27] have. And I think
[57:29] um you you might want to you might want
[57:33] to delay a purchase of the house as long
[57:36] as humanly possible if you don't need it
[57:39] emotionally. So if you need it
[57:40] emotionally, like of course then then
[57:42] buy it. Like that that it's your life.
[57:44] Like you you have to buy it if you
[57:46] really need it. But if you don't need it
[57:48] emotionally and you're just trying to
[57:51] make a financial decision, it's better
[57:53] to just wait like another 5 years and 10
[57:55] years because maybe you only need half
[57:57] of your stack or 10% of your stack to to
[58:00] buy a home. That's a lot better than
[58:03] putting all your stack now for for a
[58:05] house. So that whole demonization will
[58:08] come quicker and is already happening.
[58:11] Look at the if you look at the real
[58:13] estate price in Bitcoin the last 5
[58:15] years, 8 years, 10 years, it's minus
[58:18] 99.9% something like that. It's going
[58:21] really quickly down because Bitcoin is
[58:23] going really quickly up. And if you set
[58:25] Bitcoin as as a denomination, everything
[58:28] gets cheaper. We we always say that, but
[58:31] I think we really have to we have to
[58:33] feel this. If if you have to denominate
[58:36] your wealth in Bitcoin and you have to
[58:38] come come to a place where you really
[58:41] have, oh, I have Bitcoin as my unit of
[58:44] account and you price things in Bitcoin
[58:46] and then you really get, oh [ __ ]
[58:48] everything gets cheaper. Oh, I I can
[58:50] just chill out. I get I can have a low
[58:53] lower time preference. I can just work
[58:56] and chill out and wait and then all of a
[58:59] sudden things get magically cheaper.
[59:02] Yeah. Yeah, it's I heard a phrase a
[59:06] while back. Um, somebody said, "Oh, you
[59:08] you got to start thinking Bitcoin." I
[59:09] was like, "What the what the [ __ ] does
[59:10] that mean?" Like thinking
[59:12] Bitcoin. And I kind of worked out what
[59:14] it meant. And once you actually start
[59:16] thinking Bitcoin, you go, "Oh [ __ ] I
[59:19] see. I get it now."
[59:21] Um, and I think one of the benefits with
[59:23] that phrase is when you start to
[59:24] understand it is your time preference
[59:27] changes and you start
[59:29] to, like you said, delay things and
[59:32] think about it a bit more and go, do I
[59:34] need this? Do I need this new car every
[59:36] 3 years? No, probably
[59:38] not. It It's It made me
[59:43] realize I had to struggle with that. It
[59:45] was actually not that hard. It was
[59:47] actually not that easy for me. uh having
[59:50] a bitcoin income and having a fiat
[59:52] income because I really wanted to spend
[59:54] my fiat income and not my bitcoin income
[59:56] but the bitcoin income grew so much that
[59:58] I had to spend it and in the beginning
[60:01] it was I I thought I might just borrow
[60:07] against my bitcoin because I really
[60:08] don't want to spend it. It's this
[60:10] digital it's it's it's my digital
[60:13] Manhattan and I don't want to spend the
[60:16] uh the Manhattan property. I want to
[60:18] borrow against it and make it work. But
[60:20] it's money. We we we have to spend it if
[60:23] we want to live. And especially if you
[60:26] spend it in a way where you still have
[60:28] more Satoshi's at the end of the month
[60:30] than in the beginning of the month, you
[60:31] did not spend any Satoshi's. You you
[60:33] earn more Satoshi's. That that that's
[60:35] that's a big thing. So I guess um
[60:39] thinking in Bitcoin uh means storing
[60:42] your wealth in Bitcoin, spending in
[60:44] Bitcoin, seeing it as your unit of
[60:45] account and being a uh 100% on on
[60:49] Bitcoin. And uh I mean there's this
[60:52] question of like what what what does
[60:53] qualify as a Bitcoiner? And and for me,
[60:56] everyone is a Bitcoiner who holds or
[60:58] uses Bitcoin in some capacity. But if
[61:00] you really want to benefit and and
[61:02] embrace that that new
[61:04] revolution, go go go as all in as you
[61:08] possibly can and uh your your um how
[61:12] should I say
[61:13] it? Your risk appetite allows uh your
[61:17] conviction allows uh there's some some
[61:20] nuance to it. So if you I don't know
[61:22] have uh four kids and the company you
[61:26] need fiat reserves maybe uh you need
[61:28] some operating cash uh also the bitcoin
[61:31] companies the strategy companies they
[61:33] also have operating cash flows for 3
[61:36] months 6 months one year so always
[61:41] uh really think deeply of what do you
[61:43] need and is it good to to go all in or
[61:46] how how to should how to do it. I just
[61:49] chose I'm all in. I don't care for fiat
[61:52] operating cash. I'm I'm 26. I can do
[61:56] that. Have you thought about and have
[61:59] you come up with a timeline
[62:02] when how can I put this when it would be
[62:05] more mainstream to operate on a Bitcoin
[62:08] standard rather than juggling those two?
[62:13] I think 2050 it would be
[62:19] unreasonable in 2050 it would be very
[62:22] reasonable to assume that you can earn
[62:26] in Bitcoin pay in Bitcoin and live 100%
[62:29] on Bitcoin on most parts in the world. I
[62:32] think that's a very reasonable
[62:34] assumption. Look at how far we got in
[62:37] the first 16 years to 2050. It's another
[62:42] 25 years. So that's a time frame I'm
[62:46] looking at where we can say that we are
[62:50] kind of on a Bitcoin standard. There
[62:52] might still be fear around but you might
[62:55] not need it actually. There there is is
[62:59] is not a real need for having that fiat
[63:02] currencies. Maybe you need it for paying
[63:04] taxes. It's more like a government told
[63:06] me at that point. So, uh those things
[63:09] might still be around, but it's so
[63:11] small. Like I always make that example
[63:14] with horses. There's this first example
[63:17] in the the streets of of what was it in
[63:20] New York I think or 1920 1910 whatever
[63:24] this is. Uh and there are two pictures.
[63:26] The first picture is only horses, one
[63:29] car. 10 years later only cars, one
[63:31] horse.
[63:34] But hundreds of years later in Vienna
[63:38] 2025, we still have horses on the
[63:42] road. So it's still there. Like people
[63:46] still we we uh in for a brief period of
[63:51] time we even had police on horses in
[63:54] Austria. We no longer have it, but we
[63:56] have horses and carriages in the streets
[64:00] of Vienna where you can take tours with
[64:02] them and and and you can basically go
[64:05] around with the horses. And the same
[64:08] thing might apply to fiat. Maybe we
[64:10] always have government tokens that you
[64:12] have to interact with that you have to
[64:14] change for Bitcoin and and uh and when
[64:16] you want to get into social credit
[64:18] systems when you want to get into uh
[64:21] paying taxes when you want to get into
[64:23] the hospital and there's like some
[64:25] government social uh credit system for
[64:28] for for paying taxes. So I personally
[64:31] don't want that. Uh but I could imagine
[64:33] that it I have a hard time seeing that
[64:37] China for example completely erased
[64:40] their capital controls in 20150. I don't
[64:44] know if we can win that battle. It it's
[64:47] a really hard battle to win. Let's first
[64:50] focus on on embracing Bitcoin and uh
[64:53] making Bitcoin the main thing that that
[64:56] that that we can we can do.
[65:00] But getting China to completely embrace
[65:03] Bitcoin, being on a full Bitcoin
[65:05] standard, that might not be the case in
[65:08] 25 years. So there might still be places
[65:12] where Bitcoin adoption is not as big as
[65:15] uh as as it could be. Those nations will
[65:18] lack behind. Those nations will have a
[65:21] harder future than those nations that
[65:24] actually embrace it. Those will be
[65:25] rewarded for for embracing that. So I
[65:30] think 2050 it would be very reasonable
[65:33] to assume that and everything before
[65:37] that is also possible. We can be at the
[65:40] same stage that I just described already
[65:43] in
[65:44] 2035. It would be a little bit more
[65:46] aggressive. I don't think we come that
[65:48] quick there. But if it happens, it would
[65:52] also not surprise me. It would not be
[65:54] like oh we got quickly there. uh see how
[65:58] how far we got in the last 5
[66:00] years. Five 5 years ago, not a single
[66:04] publicly traded company was in Bitcoin.
[66:06] Now we have nation states talking about
[66:08] strategic reserves. Think about what can
[66:11] happen in the next 10 years. So um the
[66:15] timeline is hard to predict. uh and uh I
[66:18] I would never say like oh this date and
[66:20] this is exactly how it how it will shake
[66:23] out because human brains are still slow
[66:26] to adopt. But I think in 2050 it would
[66:29] be very reasonable to assume that
[66:32] Bitcoin is the main asset that most
[66:36] people save in and transact in.
[66:42] Yeah, it the numbers I try and think of
[66:47] the scale of Bitcoin the numbers just
[66:50] become obscene, you know, like what's
[66:52] what's the global asset is 900 trillion
[66:55] or something crazy. And if if Bitcoin
[66:58] was to take 10% of that, which I think
[67:01] is reasonable, I mean, it would probably
[67:03] take more, maybe 50%, but let's say 10%.
[67:06] That's a 90 trillion dollar asset that
[67:09] Bitcoin is. Like what would the price be
[67:11] then?
[67:12] And how much, like you say, how much is
[67:14] your Bitcoin worth? How many houses
[67:15] could you buy if you even if you had
[67:17] like £500 worth of Bitcoin right now?
[67:21] That's a lot of houses. The numbers just
[67:24] become ridiculous.
[67:26] I think you're very conservative in
[67:28] those uh examples. Uh I think British
[67:32] Yeah,
[67:33] the the 900 trillion uh what is above
[67:37] trillions? I forgot. What is the if we
[67:41] have like 100 trillion more than 900
[67:43] trillion I forgot like how is it called
[67:45] the thing but yeah like uh thousand
[67:48] trillions uh let's say that way um I
[67:51] think we are now J uh Jesse Meyers is I
[67:55] think the guy that always makes those
[67:56] those graphics that also um uh Sailor
[68:00] uses and he updated it now that we have
[68:04] a thousand trillions in the global
[68:07] assets And that that's that's my problem
[68:12] with all those altcoin projects. My
[68:14] problem with all the the noise in in in
[68:16] the game because they always say, "Oh,
[68:18] like we have that the better thing that
[68:20] really makes that small use case
[68:23] better." But it's a such a small
[68:25] opportunity. If you look at Bitcoin,
[68:28] what is the opportunity for Bitcoin? The
[68:30] just the money part is a 500 trillion
[68:34] dollar opportunity.
[68:36] So in my situation that I just described
[68:39] for
[68:41] 2050, most of those 500 trillion is in
[68:44] Bitcoin. I'm talking 400 450 trillion in
[68:48] and and this in in today's dollars
[68:51] terms. So without inflation that's
[68:53] that's that's the worth of Bitcoin right
[68:56] now here here and right now uh 400
[68:59] trillion. Now we are at uh 2 trillion of
[69:03] of of total market cap if if I'm not uh
[69:06] mistaken. So that's a a whole lot of
[69:10] uh more wealth in in Bitcoin. That's a
[69:13] 20x. What is it? Yeah, 20x for Yeah, 20x
[69:17] from here just to get to to that. I made
[69:20] a I think a calculation mistake in there
[69:23] probably. But anyways, it's it's a huge
[69:26] opportunity that that kind of Bitcoin
[69:30] has in that.
[69:33] Yeah. But we're also not accounting
[69:36] for the exponential economic growth with
[69:40] AI and uh robotics. Um I'm going to mess
[69:45] this up. I can't I can't remember off
[69:46] the top of my head, but Elon Musk has
[69:48] made a prediction
[69:49] that the economy will grow forever.
[69:53] global economy. Um, but it also makes me
[69:56] think like if we get to that point, is
[69:59] inflation going to be a thing then or do
[70:03] we
[70:06] expand do we expand
[70:09] global money for a different reason? I
[70:12] can't think of why,
[70:14] but you know, I can't help but think
[70:16] that we get to the point where we don't
[70:17] have inflation anymore.
[70:20] We we will always have deflation
[70:22] measured in Bitcoin. By the way, I I
[70:24] made the mistake of uh not 20x 200x from
[70:29] here. Uh so we if we capture uh the 400
[70:33] trillion, it's it's 200x and not 20x.
[70:36] Obviously I missed zero. Um but uh I'm
[70:39] I'm really bad in m multitasking. to
[70:41] calculating and speaking. I'm I'm I'm I
[70:43] I I I got to know that that this is
[70:45] really bad in I I I I have to calculate
[70:48] it before and then I can speak about it.
[70:51] And you're right, we don't expand but we
[70:55] get more efficient. And as we get more
[70:58] efficient, things get cheaper. That's
[71:00] how the what's the natural that's the
[71:02] Jeff Booof uh whole thing about Jeff
[71:05] Booof. The natural state of the economy
[71:08] and everything the world is
[71:11] deflationary. We get better and more
[71:13] efficient in doing things. So the same
[71:16] value of Bitcoin even if we are let's
[71:19] say we are at total
[71:21] uh mass adoption of Bitcoin. Everyone
[71:24] has it. We are 100% in there and we do
[71:28] not have more humans. We always stay the
[71:32] same human species and we also don't
[71:35] discover aliens or anything like that.
[71:36] So we don't have we do not expand
[71:39] anymore. Let's say if we are closed
[71:41] world where there are no more humans and
[71:43] there's no more uh alien species or
[71:46] there's no more expanding to other
[71:47] planets. In that
[71:49] situation, still Bitcoin would go up in
[71:53] purchasing power every year because we
[71:56] will get better in producing things. And
[71:59] Bitcoin might get lost still uh every
[72:02] year. I don't know about that. But even
[72:05] if it doesn't get lost, there's like not
[72:07] a single Bitcoin that gets lost. Even
[72:10] that situation, Bitcoin still gets a
[72:13] little bit more valuable each year for
[72:17] like
[72:18] 0.5%. 1% maybe uh maybe 5% depending on
[72:22] if if we have something big, especially
[72:25] with AI and all those uh different
[72:27] things that that come out because we we
[72:30] don't know what human species is really
[72:32] capable of. Think 200 years back. Do you
[72:38] think anyone would have guessed that we
[72:41] have AI now? Like, how would you even
[72:44] think of that? There was no electricity.
[72:46] There was like no computers. Uh, think
[72:50] of a caveman. Would he have guessed that
[72:53] we'll have like so like small black
[72:57] bricks that can tell us whatever we want
[73:01] to hear about the world that we that
[73:04] that we can look into like a black round
[73:07] thing and talk to the whole world all at
[73:10] once from our cave. Yeah.
[73:14] like we we have no
[73:16] clue what human civilization will go
[73:20] towards in the coming thousand 2,000
[73:23] years. So we will get a lot of more
[73:26] efficient in in that. So I I I would
[73:30] frame it as we we don't expand. We we
[73:33] don't get bigger. We get more efficient
[73:36] in doing things. And if we have a fixed
[73:39] money, we'll get an increase in our
[73:41] purchasing power. And Bitcoin not only
[73:46] has this perfect money and savings
[73:48] technology in it, it has a second thing
[73:50] also. It gets adopted also. So you get
[73:53] the efficiency of the human race each
[73:55] each year. But we have this volatility
[73:59] in this high growth phase because more
[74:01] people discover it every day. So it's
[74:05] the perfect savings technology today and
[74:09] it's the best investment you can make
[74:11] today. This is the genius of adopting
[74:14] Bitcoin right now because
[74:16] in 50 years you only get the one
[74:20] thing. Now you get both things in in 50
[74:23] years. It's not it's not an investment
[74:25] anymore. Nobody will speak of Bitcoin as
[74:28] an investment in 50 years because it
[74:30] will be like oh like what investing? No,
[74:32] it's like it's your money. Like it's
[74:34] it's like saying now oh I I invest in
[74:38] the euro. It would be ridiculous to say.
[74:41] Nobody would take you seriously and it's
[74:43] more of an investment than Bitcoin
[74:45] actually because Bitcoin is the actual
[74:47] money and uh the euro is a foreign
[74:51] currency that that that you can trade in
[74:54] that you can maybe invest in. Yeah. But
[74:56] people will say like, "Oh, you you're
[74:58] like stupid. Like, why would you invest
[75:00] in in euro?" Like that that's that's
[75:02] stupid thing to say. The same thing will
[75:04] be there if Bitcoin in 50 years is as
[75:08] adopted as I think people will be like,
[75:10] "Oh, like you're not investing in
[75:13] Bitcoin. You're saving in Bitcoin. You
[75:15] can invest in companies. You can invest
[75:17] in EI agents like things like that, but
[75:21] you cannot invest in Bitcoin." Yeah.
[75:25] Is there anything that you can think of
[75:27] that will make this fall apart, that
[75:30] will make Bitcoin fail?
[75:33] Yeah, there are a couple uh situations
[75:35] that I could think of. Uh the my
[75:38] favorite example is that there are alien
[75:41] civilizations coming to Earth with
[75:44] better technology, better money. They
[75:47] are dominating us and putting their
[75:51] monetary system onto us and they are
[75:53] just destroying Bitcoin because they are
[75:57] so superior. That might be a reason that
[76:00] Bitcoin goes down. But like what else
[76:04] would you
[76:05] do? Uh you you don't have an alien
[76:08] resistant money and that Bitcoin Bitcoin
[76:12] is the uh still your best shot. Maybe
[76:15] the aliens are um integrating Bitcoin.
[76:19] Maybe they run their own nodes
[76:21] for maybe that's why they come and they
[76:23] go, "Hey, they're using this Bitcoin
[76:25] stuff. Maybe you should go check it
[76:26] out." Exactly. So So uh that's one
[76:30] possibility, but it's very far out. Then
[76:33] there's always the possibility of a
[76:34] black swan uh in the code that just like
[76:38] we all overlooked in in the code and
[76:41] there's a huge bug in there that at some
[76:43] point just implodes the system and
[76:46] people uh can can then spend and uh
[76:49] without and stuff like that like there's
[76:51] there's just like some big bug in there.
[76:54] Uh I would put that possibility at like
[76:58] 0.00001 but it's a possibility like we
[77:00] we should not rule it out. There's
[77:02] nothing with zero risk. There's no
[77:04] 100% guarantee. But Bitcoin is the
[77:07] closest thing to 0% risk. And I'm always
[77:11] telling these people, I can think of 50
[77:15] people 50 reasons why Bitcoin fails. But
[77:18] how likely are those? Yeah. Yeah. How
[77:22] how likely is it that there is now a bug
[77:24] in the system? How likely is it that
[77:27] there's an alien civilization coming?
[77:28] How likely is it that uh uh that that
[77:32] something else in in Bitcoin happens or
[77:35] that that we all of the sudden all agree
[77:37] on hey like let's let's focus on another
[77:40] project. That's very very very very
[77:45] uh low possibility. So I do not think
[77:49] that Bitcoin will
[77:51] fail and it has a chance of being the
[77:55] end all be all money. I'm not saying it
[77:58] is the end all be all money but it has a
[78:00] good chance of that because all the
[78:03] previous money forms were not moldable.
[78:08] Bitcoin is code and you can change the
[78:13] the software. You you can change the
[78:15] code. We can fork Bitcoin. If we really
[78:18] come to the conclusion, hey, we now have
[78:21] civilization on Mars and we cannot
[78:25] transact in Bitcoin in Mars. We don't
[78:27] need a mass coin. We might just be able
[78:31] to change Bitcoin in a way so we can
[78:34] transact not only on Earth with Bitcoin,
[78:37] but also on Mars with Bitcoin. So, it
[78:41] has a good chance of being the end all
[78:44] be all money.
[78:47] And therefore I I always ask even if
[78:51] there's risks what else would you do
[78:54] right now like what what what else is
[78:58] there that you can put your money in the
[79:00] euro this I can tell you the euro does
[79:03] not survive the next 50 years. I can
[79:05] tell you
[79:06] that I I would bet with
[79:09] everyone uh any amount that the euro is
[79:12] not there in 50 years. It might be there
[79:16] with a different name or in a different
[79:18] form. Uh maybe the European bank has
[79:21] some sort of uh fiat uh uh feared um
[79:27] government token, but it's either
[79:30] completely gone or
[79:33] 99.99% of the value is gone. So that's
[79:38] pretty sure for me. Yeah. Far more
[79:40] likely. Yeah. Then then then you go to
[79:43] gold. Then you're like, "Yeah, gold
[79:45] already failed as a medium of exchange.
[79:47] It still has some store value aspect to
[79:49] it, but it already failed as a medium of
[79:51] exchange. I do do not even pay with
[79:55] cash. I pay with my phone. I pay
[79:58] everything with my phone, either Bitcoin
[80:00] or credit card.
[80:02] So this is nothing for the new
[80:05] generation. The new generation does not
[80:07] want to deal with cash. They don't want
[80:09] to deal with gold. They don't they want
[80:10] to deal with digital things and this
[80:13] will only accelerate. This will only get
[80:15] crazier at some point. Nobody wants to
[80:17] do anything physical. We will have
[80:19] robots to do that. I'm I'm moving
[80:22] tomorrow to a new apartment. Uh I don't
[80:25] want to do that. I want to have a robot
[80:28] that carry that packs my stuff, carries
[80:31] my stuff, and puts my stuff. I don't
[80:33] want to do that. So, uh we we have
[80:37] something digital. So gold is uh
[80:39] definitely not as valuable in 50 years
[80:42] as it's now compared to Bitcoin. Uh then
[80:46] what else do we have?
[80:48] Stocks. Companies will go under. Uh look
[80:51] look 50 years back in the stock market
[80:53] and look at the top five companies. You
[80:56] don't even know them.
[80:58] Do you think uh you know now which five
[81:01] companies will be the top five companies
[81:02] in 50 years? I have no clue. I can tell
[81:06] you that Bitcoin will be uh up there and
[81:08] will be probably the best and biggest
[81:10] asset, but I have no clue which bit
[81:13] company will be up there in 50 years.
[81:15] Probably the company that will be number
[81:17] one in 50 years doesn't even exist right
[81:19] now. So, what else do you have like
[81:24] government bonds? Like, come on. Don't
[81:27] be
[81:29] serious. Uh there's no real other
[81:33] solution outside of Bitcoin. I I would
[81:35] not know what I would sell it for. If
[81:37] I'm forced to sell
[81:39] Bitcoin, I'm just spending it on my own
[81:42] knowledge, on my own skills, and in my
[81:45] own company. That that's the only thing
[81:47] that I know that probably has a higher
[81:50] return of investment. If I can invest in
[81:53] my knowledge, in my skills, that's
[81:55] probably the only place you can put your
[81:58] Bitcoin that has an higher return on
[82:00] investment than just keeping it in
[82:03] Bitcoin. Yeah. Maybe you can invest in
[82:05] Bitcoin mining. That That's also an
[82:07] interesting idea, but I'm not into that
[82:09] that deeply. And I also don't I do a
[82:12] little bit of mining, but not really.
[82:15] So, what else can you put your money in?
[82:18] There's nothing really like and and this
[82:21] is this is basically how Sailor did it.
[82:24] He went through all the assets. What
[82:26] what can I buy? I have 400 million. I
[82:28] remember back then he just had 400
[82:30] million on the balance sheet. And he ask
[82:32] himself, "What? How can I that? There's
[82:35] definitely something wrong with the US
[82:37] dollar. Where can I park my money that
[82:39] doesn't
[82:40] melt?" Bitcoin. He went through
[82:43] everything. He researched every freaking
[82:45] asset, every stock, gold, everything.
[82:48] Real estate. re do you think real estate
[82:52] do you think
[82:53] um a a a place to live will have the
[82:57] same value in 50 years when we already
[83:01] see now it getting demonetized so
[83:03] quickly
[83:05] it's it's a con consumption good uh and
[83:08] people say oh yeah like real estate is
[83:11] scarce no it's not
[83:14] it's we we humans are really creative we
[83:18] we we We will we will build up we have a
[83:22] lot of forest. Uh there's a lot of water
[83:25] in on earth. Maybe we'll build something
[83:27] on top of the water.
[83:29] Dubai that that was not existing uh
[83:34] previously. So I I don't get the the
[83:38] saying that real estate is scarce. No.
[83:40] No. Like if if demand for houses go up
[83:44] drastically, there will be companies
[83:46] that build more houses that will build
[83:49] uh build out more land. Uh we in Austria
[83:53] is amazing examples. We have a small
[83:57] village where there are 10 houses then
[84:00] you drive 30 minutes where there's
[84:03] nothing and then there's another village
[84:06] like Austria is I think Donald Trump
[84:09] said it once. Oh, like Austria is just a
[84:11] bunch of trees and they're living in in
[84:13] in the jungle. It's not like that.
[84:16] But but but we have a lot of trees and a
[84:19] lot of
[84:20] forests. So I don't get that real estate
[84:23] is is any any scarce asset. So uh again
[84:28] for for for the situation why why could
[84:32] Bitcoin fail? Like what else would you
[84:34] buy?
[84:37] I can't think of anything else.
[84:39] baseball cards maybe. Yeah, that's
[84:43] that's one thing that I left out.
[84:44] There's collectibles, there's cars,
[84:46] there is those things, but you really
[84:50] don't want to be in a situation where
[84:52] you're forced that your financial
[84:55] default. Your savings technology is in
[84:59] collectibles.
[85:01] Yeah, those can get ruined. You can trip
[85:04] over them. You can spill coffee over the
[85:07] cards. you uh uh you you can have an
[85:11] accident with your uh car uh that is so
[85:15] valuable. So you you want to have
[85:19] something solid, something really nice
[85:22] as a store of value. That's only Bitcoin
[85:26] that there's nothing else. This is the
[85:29] realization uh that I had. I I thought I
[85:35] want to
[85:38] review a little bit what I've learned
[85:40] from all those podcasts that I've done
[85:42] and I've sat down and just wrote of like
[85:46] okay what did I've learned and there
[85:48] might be a book coming later this year
[85:50] or next year from that process but the
[85:53] thing that I've came to
[85:57] know is that Bitcoin is not just like an
[86:01] investment not just a money not just uh
[86:04] an another investment
[86:07] that might really change how we interact
[86:10] with each other. It it is so much bigger
[86:13] than just hey where do I park my money
[86:17] because Bitcoin is obviously with a huge
[86:20] distance the best option for that as we
[86:23] just uh discussed the last like 10 20
[86:25] minutes but it has such a profound
[86:28] impact on on humanity in ways we can
[86:32] only speculate on. So I the the more I
[86:38] look into Bitcoin, the more I talk with
[86:40] people in and outside of Bitcoin about
[86:43] Bitcoin, I
[86:46] realize it's coming. It's it's
[86:48] inevitable and it and it is way bigger
[86:51] than than people think. And I also came
[86:53] to know that even
[86:54] Bitcoiners are not really bullish enough
[86:57] on Bitcoin. They they
[86:59] all like there's Samsung Mao, there is
[87:02] uh CK, there there are some people that
[87:04] really get the the grasp of of of that
[87:07] how big it could be. But on a long
[87:11] enough time
[87:13] horizon, Bitcoin changes everything.
[87:18] So if Bitcoin is an investment, maybe we
[87:21] could finish it off by
[87:24] saying Bitcoin is
[87:28] the greatest investment because it's an
[87:30] investment in the future of humanity. I
[87:34] love that. That's really great.
[87:38] So, if you want humanity to thrive and
[87:42] succeed, buy Bitcoin.
[87:45] That's
[87:46] um I I just had the podcast yesterday
[87:49] literally and uh this is an
[87:54] ethical view on Bitcoin and maybe that's
[87:57] a really great way to to to end the
[87:59] podcast. Think about a fiat world and a
[88:03] Bitcoin
[88:04] world. And
[88:06] imagine you sleep tonight and you don't
[88:11] know who you will wake up as. So you
[88:16] might wake up as the president. You
[88:19] might wake up as someone in in pre
[88:24] Brazil where they don't do not even have
[88:27] banking. You you lost everything and you
[88:30] just wake up as a new person and you
[88:32] have whatever they have. In the first
[88:35] situation, you wake up in a feared
[88:37] world. In the second situation, you wake
[88:40] up in a Bitcoin world. In what situation
[88:43] do you want to wake up? In the feared
[88:45] world, you might be on the top of the
[88:48] ladder. You might be a cantillionaire
[88:51] that really benefits from the feared
[88:55] world and you have access to the banking
[88:57] system, but you might also wake up in a
[89:00] part of the world where you don't even
[89:02] have access to the banking accounts. You
[89:05] you don't have access to anything and
[89:07] you might die this one day because you
[89:11] you are
[89:13] uh you you don't get food. you might die
[89:16] on that day. And then the same situation
[89:20] but with Bitcoin. In a whole Bitcoin
[89:23] world where everyone has Bitcoin and
[89:25] everyone transacts in
[89:27] Bitcoin, you have the situation where
[89:30] you can get to money. Even if you are
[89:33] the worst possible of those 8 billion
[89:36] people, at least you have the chance of
[89:40] connecting with the monetary system
[89:42] because the monetary system is open and
[89:44] permissionless for everyone and doesn't
[89:47] exclude
[89:48] anyone. You can transact on the world,
[89:51] you can put proof of work in you will be
[89:55] in a way better situation. Obviously,
[89:58] there is like now places that don't have
[90:00] internet and and those kind of things
[90:02] and where there there will be for a very
[90:04] long time also no Bitcoin. But that's
[90:07] not the fault of
[90:08] Bitcoin. But it's the fault of the fiat
[90:11] system that there are people unbanked.
[90:14] It's crazy for me that there are more
[90:17] people with a smartphone and an internet
[90:19] connection than there are people with a
[90:21] bank account. Like how is that possible?
[90:24] Yeah. If you have a bank, if if you have
[90:26] internet and a and a phone, you have
[90:28] Bitcoin. But if you have internet and a
[90:32] phone, you don't automatically also have
[90:36] fiat because you need permission to have
[90:39] a bank account. And I had an interview
[90:43] with an African lady and she told me
[90:46] about the story how Bitcoin kind of
[90:48] saved her because uh her husband did not
[90:53] wanted to give her access to the bank
[90:56] account because it was just not a
[90:58] tradition in her village. So she when
[91:01] she wanted to spend something had to get
[91:03] the permission of the husband. It's a
[91:06] world that I can cannot even imagine. I
[91:08] live in Austria like here it's normal
[91:09] that everyone has a bank
[91:11] account but it's today where there are
[91:16] women that don't have an access to bank
[91:18] account but the man has with Bitcoin
[91:20] it's not possible she goes to a bank and
[91:23] they don't even allow her to have a bank
[91:24] account because she needs the signature
[91:27] of the husband so she can get a bank
[91:29] account it's something that I think in
[91:31] Austria and the UK and most people
[91:33] watching have a hard time understanding
[91:36] how bad the banking system really is. So
[91:39] from an ethical standpoint, do you want
[91:41] to wake up tomorrow as a random person
[91:44] in fiat or in a Bitcoin world? And I
[91:48] want to wake up in a Bitcoin world.
[91:51] Yeah.
[91:54] Awesome.
[91:56] Awesome.
[91:58] Well, that was powerful. That was that
[92:01] was really really good. Um, is there
[92:03] anything you want to mention before we
[92:04] part ways? I really enjoyed talking to
[92:06] you, Robin. It's been absolutely
[92:08] fantastic.
[92:12] Not really.
[92:13] Um, be curious and, uh, stay hungry.
[92:19] Stay hungry. Awesome. Rob, thank you so
[92:22] much for your time. I really appreciate
[92:23] you, buddy. Um, I wish you all the
[92:25] success in the future for your
[92:28] endeavors. I mean, well, you're already
[92:30] successful doing what you're doing. Um,
[92:32] if I could, you know, get a quarter of
[92:36] the way where you are, then I'll be a
[92:37] happy man. But, uh, I'm
[92:39] here, um, just trying to accelerate
[92:42] adoption in the UK, um, having
[92:44] conversations with people that know a
[92:46] fair a hell of a lot more than I do.
[92:49] Hopefully, um, this podcast might change
[92:51] somebody's life. So, thank you very much
[92:52] for your time. Thank you so much for
[92:54] having me. I really appreciate it. And
[92:56] by the way, for everyone that is
[92:57] watching and listening, um do him do
[93:01] Leia in um in in favor. It really helps
[93:05] if you enjoyed this talk to share it and
[93:09] to to get it across to many more people.
[93:12] Not only you support Bitcoin by that,
[93:14] but also you support a greater. And we
[93:17] need as many educators as possible in
[93:19] the space. We are so we are so few
[93:24] people that educate on Bitcoin versus
[93:27] how many people there are educating on
[93:30] crypto, educating on traditional
[93:34] financial ETF stocks things like we we
[93:38] need to 100x the numbers of podcasts,
[93:42] Tik Tockers, uh Instagram people that do
[93:46] Twitter and and all those educators and
[93:49] content creators stuff. We need so many
[93:51] more. And if you are listening to
[93:55] podcasts, you you should and you can
[93:59] support the the hosts and the speakers
[94:01] by just sharing the message. It it
[94:04] literally just takes like 5 seconds and
[94:05] you're like sending it on Twitter and
[94:07] just like that that really makes a
[94:09] difference for the algorithms on YouTube
[94:12] and on all the platforms that there is
[94:15] and it it helps uh get the Bitcoin
[94:18] message uh further way further than than
[94:22] you think because you send a signal to
[94:24] YouTube that this Bitcoin content that
[94:26] you really enjoyed this one.
[94:29] Rob, thank you mate. I really appreciate
[94:31] you.
[94:33] See you.
