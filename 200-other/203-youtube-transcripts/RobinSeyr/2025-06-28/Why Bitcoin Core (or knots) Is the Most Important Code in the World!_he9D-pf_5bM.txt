[00:00] The more time you spend as a contributor
[00:02] at that level in terms of being a
[00:03] maintainer, the more you have to lose in
[00:05] terms of trying to go the other way
[00:06] around of either being corrupted or
[00:08] changing cuz you spent all these years
[00:10] building up to that point of both
[00:11] competency but also trust with the
[00:13] ecosystem. So it's kind of a
[00:14] counterintuitive thing to do. I work on
[00:16] Bitcoin core mostly PR reviews and other
[00:18] than that I write for Forbes cataloging
[00:20] kind of the dynamics here on the ground
[00:21] in Africa with regards to Bitcoin. And
[00:23] what keeps me excited with regards to
[00:24] Bitcoin is honestly just the possibility
[00:26] of having many more people around the
[00:28] world giving access to financial freedom
[00:31] technology essentially which I've
[00:32] honestly really tremendously benefited
[00:34] from personally. If you do keep the
[00:36] whole focus in terms of building and
[00:38] also providing value then you naturally
[00:39] will have the second aspect which is
[00:41] number go up cuz again like I said just
[00:43] a reflection of validating the former
[00:45] USDT is essentially a translation of the
[00:47] dollar dominance. So in a certain way,
[00:48] the US dollar itself is technically a
[00:50] CBDC too from that control capture
[00:52] aspect. So naturally makes sense that we
[00:54] we'll see that manifest as well in USDT.
[00:57] So again, it's just one of the many
[00:59] reasons why Bitcoin is just a far better
[01:01] long-term solution for a lot of people,
[01:03] especially when it comes to protecting
[01:04] against that capture.
[01:07] [Music]
[01:09] Maybe give with the viewers and the
[01:12] listeners some background of who you are
[01:14] and why you're excited about Bitcoin.
[01:16] Oh,
 for sure. So just to keep it brief,
[01:17] I'm Abubakur Khalil. I run Recursive
[01:20] Capital, which is a Bitcoin VC. You
[01:21] invest in exclusively Bitcoin companies
[01:24] in Africa through equity based funding.
[01:26] I also run B trust. I'm one of the board
[01:28] members as well where we essentially
[01:30] decentralize Bitcoin development in the
[01:31] global south in Africa. So we provide
[01:33] grants primarily to developers but also
[01:35] developer education programs, events,
[01:37] etc. And separately I work on Bitcoin
[01:39] core most CPR reviews and other than
[01:41] that I write for Forbes cataloging kind
[01:43] of the dynamics here on the ground in
[01:44] Africa with regards to Bitcoin. And what
[01:46] keeps me excited with regards to Bitcoin
[01:48] is honestly just the possibility of
[01:50] having many more people around the world
[01:52] giving access to financial freedom
[01:54] technology essentially which I've
[01:56] honestly really tremendously benefited
[01:58] from personally the last few years in
[02:00] terms of being an NER and trying to keep
[02:02] up with being a you know an individual
[02:04] that can communicate value across the
[02:06] globe instantly cheaply. That's amazing.
[02:09] You can send value where and I think
[02:12] people that don't have that use case
[02:14] don't get that.
 I only got that use case
[02:17] when I started paying freelancers uh
[02:20] outside of Austria and like paying them
[02:22] in Colombia, El Salvador. And it's like
[02:25] it's a game changer when you have
[02:27] Bitcoin. I pay like 70 cents sometimes a
[02:29] euro for a transaction. If the same
[02:32] thing happens on fiat, I have to pay€ 10
[02:33] to 20 on my end. and and on his hand he
[02:37] also has to pay€ 10 or 20 euros. So
[02:40] there's a lot of value lost along the
[02:42] way. Uh if you have Bitcoin you have an
[02:44] instant and there's always no KVC and
[02:46] all those things. So that's that's a
[02:48] that's an
 that's a thing that I think a
[02:50] lot of people under uh underestimate
[02:52] that don't see the use case by
[02:54] themselves. So it's the the medium of
[02:56] exchange that that you can communicate
[02:59] values that's that's for you the core
[03:01] value of Bitcoin. 100% 100% everything
[03:04] else is
 interesting. Yeah, there's a lot
[03:06] of store value talk. There's a lot of
[03:10] number a lot of uh strategic bitcoin
[03:14] reserves, a lot of like borrowing
[03:15] against your stack and and all those
[03:17] financial engineering talks when you
[03:19] listen I don't know if you have listened
[03:20] to Vegas or you were in Vegas but this
[03:23] is kind of like where currently a lot of
[03:26] the focus is. Um, is that natural,
[03:29] normal in the phase that we are
[03:31] currently in with with Bitcoin or do you
[03:33] see it as kind of a distraction?
 I see
[03:34] it's part distraction, but it's also
[03:36] part kind of confirmation that there is
[03:38] value in the space. I think just to like
[03:42] I said a few moments ago, I think it's
[03:43] one of those things where price is just
[03:45] a reflection of like the current value
[03:48] that people place on this network itself
[03:50] as a monetary network. And I think each
[03:53] obviously each price cycle just comes
[03:54] with its own share of market exuberance
[03:56] which is kind of good and bad. It's good
[03:58] in the sense that investor appetite is
[03:59] really high. So you get a lot of deals
[04:01] closed in terms of the entrepreneur
[04:02] side. But the bad side is there's a lot
[04:05] of distractions and a lot of people
[04:06] trying to kind of redefine what the core
[04:09] value is of Bitcoin which happens every
[04:11] time where whether is as fully just
[04:13] store value and everything else is
[04:14] secondary or whether it's Bitcoin DeFi
[04:17] now in the case that we're having or
[04:19] just some other way that they're
[04:20] re-evaluating what Bitcoin's value prop
[04:23] is especially through like conventional
[04:24] stratify means which I think is
[04:26] completely not useful in terms of
[04:29] long-term what Bitcoin's true value
[04:31] should be in terms of humanity as oosed
[04:33] to like what a lot of people are talking
[04:34] about which is essentially just doing
[04:36] all the trade stuff but on Bitcoin with
[04:38] you know different narratives but there
[04:40] are definitely benefits to the treasury
[04:41] side and all the other things we can
[04:43] definitely get into that separately
[04:45] interesting I mean you also see a lot
[04:47] like you are as you said like all the
[04:49] things that that you are doing uh with
[04:52] companies with with the developers with
[04:54] all the things that you're doing um do
[04:57] you see actually that price is helping
[05:00] the community like if if the price rises
[05:02] Is there like a lot more happening on
[05:04] the company side?
 Oh, definitely. Each
[05:06] time there's a lot of price action. We
[05:09] see a lot of people both enthusiastic
[05:10] even on the dev side to a certain
[05:12] extent. But I see over the years it's
[05:14] been interesting to see it kind of
[05:15] decouple. I don't think we'll get to the
[05:17] point where there's like zero
[05:18] correlation between price and people's
[05:19] enthusiasm both developers and
[05:21] entrepreneurs. But over the years
[05:23] definitely reduced in terms of like 5
[05:25] years ago it was purely just based on
[05:26] price. Like people only cared about
[05:28] Bitcoin whether it's to develop or write
[05:30] code and the price was up. But now it
[05:32] seems people have gone through a few
[05:33] price cycles. So they kind of get the
[05:35] lay of the land in terms of this being
[05:37] kind of part for the course as part of
[05:39] the journey.
 So because people are
[05:41] getting used to the price cycles, the
[05:44] price cycles also have less effect on
[05:47] the actual business.
 Oh yeah. I think
[05:50] right now the majority of the price
[05:51] action is more to do with institutional
[05:54] adoption being more excited than average
[05:56] folks that have been around in the
[05:57] Bitcoin space. For them really it's a
[05:59] case of like having their affairs in
[06:00] order. So whether it's moving a lot more
[06:02] to USDT or probably even the opposite
[06:04] moving it away from USDT to Bitcoin for
[06:06] like long-term savings especially when
[06:08] the dips are there and kind of the whole
[06:10] um DCA uh culture which has formed in
[06:13] the last two years I see in places like
[06:14] Nigeria and other parts of Africa.
 I
[06:17] asked you before we started recording an
[06:19] interesting question I want to ask you
[06:20] again because it was interesting how you
[06:22] how you answered. Um I asked you before
[06:25] what is kind of keeping you up at night
[06:27] in the last two two weeks uh was
[06:30] currently happening in Bitcoin like
[06:31] what's currently on top of your mind
[06:33] when you think about Bitcoin?
 Yeah
[06:35] definitely it's kind of twofold. So you
[06:37] know when you asked I definitely gave
[06:39] the the company side. So I'll start with
[06:40] that and then the developer side. I
[06:42] think on the company side it's been
[06:44] interesting to see dynamics unfold on
[06:46] the Bitcoin DeFi side. I think again the
[06:48] exuberance in this current cycle is kind
[06:50] of manifesting as Bitcoin treasuries as
[06:53] you know collateralized loans etc which
[06:56] is not a bad thing. I think honestly
[06:57] that's kind of the next evolution in
[06:59] terms of the the next stage of both
[07:01] adoption but also more financialization
[07:03] on Bitcoin. So there's definitely a plus
[07:04] there. But the issue on the kind of the
[07:07] pipeline side for us in terms of
[07:09] companies is we're seeing a lot more
[07:10] noise in terms of I mean sometimes even
[07:12] outright as a repoation pitches which
[07:15] absolutely makes no sense and kind of
[07:17] hurts the entire purpose of doing this
[07:19] all the way up to attempts to kind of
[07:21] frame things from again like I said DeFi
[07:24] but just with Bitcoin tech which not a
[07:26] lot of those constructs even make sense
[07:28] or even sometimes just asking simple
[07:30] questions like what happens when there's
[07:32] a liquidation event for the loans and
[07:33] then they're like you We'll see when we
[07:35] get there. I mean, that's totally
[07:37] unhelpful in terms of analyzing whether
[07:39] things will work will work. So, I think
[07:41] we're at a stage where there's a lot of
[07:42] excitement. There are a lot of
[07:43] individuals that are rethinking tools
[07:45] and services that previously there
[07:47] wasn't a lot of market appetite for
[07:48] which there is an abundance of right
[07:50] now. So, I think we're going to have
[07:52] maybe the next honestly couple months
[07:55] even into maybe January 26 where there's
[07:57] just going to be a huge amount of noise
[07:58] as long as the price keeps going up.
[08:00] But, if we have a dip, I think we'll
[08:01] have some sort of a correction in terms
[08:02] of the focus. So on the dev side, I kind
[08:04] of fear that it would sort of bleed in
[08:06] terms of what developers see as uh I
[08:09] guess use cases on the ground and kind
[08:10] of rep prioritizing where development
[08:12] should go in terms of focus. So
[08:14] definitely hope and I am kind of very
[08:16] optimistic seeing things with Bitcoin
[08:18] core and some of the other projects kind
[08:20] of not letting the market hype and all
[08:22] the chaos happening outside and noise
[08:24] kind of filter into the uh the project
[08:25] itself and kind development.
[08:28] You also said something uh other
[08:30] interesting before that you said you
[08:32] would like to see a dip in the price to
[08:35] get the focus back because the price is
[08:37] kind of like distracting from the actual
[08:39] thing and building it like this this
[08:41] builder markets and and bull markets
[08:44] kind of thesis and I think we either
[08:46] need a serious correction back to like
[08:48] maybe a 60k 50 so folks can get a bit
[08:51] more calm or the price can keep going up
[08:54] and the hope is that a lot more people
[08:57] or a growing number of people start to
[08:58] refocus and understand, you know, and
[09:00] kind of band together to realize that
[09:02] yes, this is exciting times, but it's
[09:04] just a validation of the last couple
[09:06] years of building.
 It's so interesting
[09:07] when you also bring up the those weird
[09:11] rehypoification
[09:12] pitches and all the things that you're
[09:14] getting. I mean, we have seen this so
[09:16] many times in the past. I mean, FDX says
[09:19] this is not that long ago. I guess um
[09:22] there are probably some people uh that
[09:24] listen to that that came after FDX into
[09:27] Bitcoin because I think it has been 2022
[09:29] and and you can come in 2023 or four in
[09:33] into Bitcoin and maybe never heard even
[09:35] of FDX and Celsius and like what are you
[09:38] talking about? But those those things
[09:40] happened in the past so many times and
[09:44] FDX Celsius is just like famous examples
[09:46] of that. in the same uh time there were
[09:49] like 20 similar companies that are
[09:51] failing and probably more that I don't
[09:53] even know about. Um
[09:56] do you see something like that just
[09:58] happening all over again because the
[10:00] price cycles are still so high uh and
[10:03] and so volatile so that it is just human
[10:06] nature to try to capitalize on that and
[10:09] think oh maybe this time the cycle
[10:11] breaks and it only goes up and if if it
[10:13] only goes up it it actually will work.
[10:15] Yeah, I think we'll see a combo of a
[10:18] variety of things. I think I mean
[10:20] history repeats itself, but not
[10:21] necessarily in the exact same way. I
[10:23] think kind of just rhymes. I think what
[10:25] we're likely going to see is a different
[10:27] version of the rehypocation situation or
[10:29] the IUS we saw. I think it'll probably
[10:31] be based on positions that people have
[10:33] taken that are too overlevered in terms
[10:35] of, you know, the whole treasury side,
[10:37] etc. So, one or two things could happen.
[10:39] And I mean it's not me prognosticating
[10:41] but just how I see things could play out
[10:44] would be on one front we could have a
[10:46] correction which would likely expose
[10:48] those who are overleveraged. Two we
[10:50] could actually see even more price
[10:52] action going up and then maybe due to
[10:54] some of the immediate um hand
[10:56] arrangements that they have on the
[10:58] financial side could implode. So, it's
[11:01] kind of one of those two things and
[11:03] hopefully hopefully folks aren't
[11:04] involved with either or I guess
[11:06] overexposed with those type of two
[11:08] options whether it's on the you know um
[11:10] company side or some other investment or
[11:12] asset they're holding currently. But
[11:14] like I said, I'm very optimistic. I
[11:15] think there are definitely two growing
[11:16] camps of the really really excited folks
[11:19] which is kind of a blend of those who
[11:20] have already been in the space and those
[11:21] who are coming into the space that feel
[11:23] Bitcoin DeFi is now a thing. So, we're
[11:25] getting all the DeFi folks pretty much
[11:27] from outside of Bitcoin coming in now.
[11:29] And then there's definitely that small
[11:30] group that's always eternal in the
[11:32] Bitcoin space of highly focused
[11:34] builders, entrepreneurs, etc. So that's
[11:36] kind of where the core focus is on my
[11:37] end in terms of why I pay more attention
[11:39] to
[11:40] about the the builders and not the
[11:43] borrow against your Bitcoin crowd.
 I
[11:45] think there's definitely a lot that
[11:46] needs to be proved out on the borrowing
[11:47] side, especially in terms of the the
[11:49] structures we have. I think a lot of
[11:51] them are really um they're really at the
[11:53] infancy stage. So not a lot of the
[11:55] products have been battle tested in
[11:56] terms of like I said liquidation or even
[11:59] some of the some of the positions. So
[12:00] we'll likely have to see maybe in the
[12:02] next couple of months the ones that
[12:03] employed and hopefully people learn from
[12:04] that.
 What do you think is most
[12:06] important that we build on Bitcoin if we
[12:09] think about developing the ecosystem?
[12:12] What is like the the one two projects
[12:14] that you're like okay this is probably
[12:15] most important to build out for the
[12:17] future
 probably across three things I
[12:19] think or maybe even possibly four. I
[12:21] think on the loan side, an interesting
[12:23] concept that will be nice to see people
[12:25] nail down is on the ethical loan side.
[12:28] The last 2 years we had a lot of talk
[12:30] about rethinking about how loans operate
[12:32] with regards to Bitcoin being a
[12:34] deflationary asset, no need for the
[12:36] interest, etc. So, I'm yet to see at
[12:38] least on the fund side any sort of pitch
[12:40] that concretely addresses that without
[12:42] having some of the issues we've seen
[12:43] with others um existing traditional
[12:46] financial structures or uh products all
[12:49] the way up to even just outright just
[12:51] copying things that don't make sense
[12:53] really in the Bitcoin space. And then
[12:55] separate to that, I'd say another aspect
[12:56] is definitely on the mining side. I
[12:58] think that's going to drive a lot even
[13:00] beyond just electrification. and I think
[13:02] is going to drive policy here especially
[13:03] in Africa all the way up to even seeing
[13:06] how that could blend into artificial
[13:08] intelligence or just providing compute
[13:10] and kind of using that as a
[13:11] bootstrapping mechanism. So I think
[13:13] there's definitely going to be a lot
[13:14] going on in the Bitcoin mining side as
[13:16] well even as like a play for treasuries
[13:18] too. And then separately I think the
[13:19] treasury aspect does have value. I think
[13:21] we have a lot of companies in Africa
[13:23] that have essentially dormant dollars in
[13:26] US bank accounts which are not
[13:28] necessarily in their interest given the
[13:29] fact that we saw what happened with
[13:31] Mercury last year where they rugpulled
[13:32] essentially every founder from this side
[13:34] of the world given the compliance cost.
[13:36] So I think it's another aspect for them
[13:38] to kind of explore protecting their
[13:40] existing liquidity that would have been
[13:41] idle that would now be productively used
[13:43] by holding Bitcoin. And I say the last
[13:45] one really is just a it's not
[13:47] necessarily a company. I think it's more
[13:49] to do with a frame of mind in terms of
[13:51] builders and entrepreneurs, which is
[13:53] making sure that they're building with
[13:55] kind of the framing that Bitcoin is
[13:57] money and not just a store of value and
[13:59] then providing real world uh products
[14:02] and services that actually cater to a
[14:04] real demographic of people on the ground
[14:05] and not like a theoretically cooked up
[14:07] uh demographic.
 How important is this uh
[14:11] money narrative versus just a store of
[14:13] value?
[14:15] Very. I think
[14:17] you need to have one if you want to have
[14:20] the other and having the other doesn't
[14:22] necessarily give you the other. So what
[14:23] I mean concretely is if you focus too
[14:26] much on the value side or you know the
[14:28] money number go up etc. you wouldn't
[14:30] necessarily have Bitcoin's core value
[14:33] like I said which is being a money
[14:35] maintained in a sustainable way. you'll
[14:37] likely see development focus shift into
[14:39] maximizing
[14:40] future returns or all these other things
[14:42] that maybe are kind of out of the scope
[14:44] of Bitcoin that a lot of people that
[14:45] have been involved in the space for this
[14:47] long hold dear. And I say on the other
[14:49] side, if you do keep the whole Bitcoin
[14:51] is a money um narrative or not
[14:53] necessarily narrative but focus in terms
[14:55] of building and also providing value
[14:57] then you actually will have the second
[14:58] aspect which is number go up cuz again
[15:01] like I said it's just a reflection of
[15:02] validating the former. So I think we
[15:04] definitely need to narrow down on that
[15:05] initial focus of Bitcoin is still money.
[15:08] That kind of primary thing why everyone
[15:09] should be building and everything else
[15:10] is kind of a consequence of how well
[15:12] that is built.
 I want to bring that up
[15:14] because I'm I'm actually curious on on
[15:17] how how it's running. May maybe I'll
[15:19] I'll find it uh quickly for you. Uh and
[15:24] I'm curious on on on what you say to
[15:26] that because I think you kind of
[15:28] included that in the beginning. Um here
[15:32] it is. I think it's uh it's not a
[15:35] popular poll
[15:37] as a as a as a thought. Um I will I will
[15:41] just uh share that quickly with you with
[15:44] screen window.
[15:47] Here it is. Uh share I so it's not a
[15:52] popular poll. Usually I get like 1,300
[15:55] uh votes and I mean it's just like 3
[15:57] hours out but like the 65 is is very
[16:00] low. I asked the question are the medium
[16:02] of exchange attributes of bitcoin what
[16:04] makes the store of value so valuable
[16:07] um because it's kind of for me the frame
[16:09] of mind
[16:12] it all started with Jeff poof and may
[16:13] people that listen daily will be so
[16:16] already tired of me saying that but Jeff
[16:19] poof kind of opened that question in the
[16:21] podcast where what if bitcoin fails as a
[16:25] mean of exchange it most likely will
[16:27] also fail as a store of value and you
[16:30] said in the beginning for you it's all
[16:33] about the being able to communicate
[16:36] value through space and time. Um but
[16:39] mostly about the the space aspects and
[16:41] not the the the store of value aspect.
[16:44] And I ask that because this is for me
[16:48] the most solid argument why you should
[16:51] care about media of exchange because the
[16:53] med of exchange attributes is the thing
[16:56] that makes the store of value so
[16:59] valuable. if you couldn't trans if you
[17:02] couldn't get Bitcoin across borders, if
[17:05] you couldn't uh have have it like all
[17:08] all those things, I don't know if it
[17:11] would be that valuable just having a
[17:16] thing that is scarce like like like
[17:20] there are a lot of digital things that
[17:22] like it's okay. It's not it's it's so
[17:24] big and the mining aspect and the proof
[17:26] of work aspect it's still it's still
[17:28] amazing but what if you could not
[17:31] transact it what if what if it's just uh
[17:34] like basically number go up without the
[17:35] freedom aspect of it I don't know if
[17:38] people would be so
[17:40] um religious almost about it and so uh
[17:44] the community would probably also not be
[17:47] so powerful
[17:49] so that's kind of the question where I'm
[17:51] like okay what if the media exchange
[17:53] attributes were not there, is the store
[17:54] valued and even like would this even
[17:57] occur?
 I mean, not necessarily, but I
[18:00] guess we'll never see that play out cuz
[18:01] we're always going to be in a reality
[18:03] where the former came before the latter.
[18:05] So, the actual value, which is
[18:06] communicating across space and time,
[18:08] like you mentioned versus the other way
[18:10] around. But if we do end up in a
[18:12] situation where Bitcoin loses its core
[18:14] ethos, like I said, of actually
[18:15] communicating this value over time,
[18:17] etc., and overspace and I think we'll
[18:19] likely be in a state where a lot of the
[18:22] Bitcoin naysayers and some of the more
[18:23] traditional talking heads and uh some of
[18:26] the magazines without naming names
[18:28] wouldn't necessarily be validated given
[18:30] the biggest criticism that they've had
[18:32] of Bitcoin is that it has no core value
[18:34] which if we do miss this core value
[18:36] which we're talking about then truly
[18:37] they will be they'll be validated and
[18:39] correct in the sense that Bitcoin
[18:40] essentially be the the pet rock the
[18:42] whole emoji will really be true at that
[18:44] point where there's no difference
[18:46] between you know a bitcoin coin versus a
[18:48] Lebu doll or you know some other thing
[18:50] that is like a collectible etc. So I
[18:53] think really is very very important and
[18:54] you put it really right and again this
[18:56] is uh framing you know Jeff and some of
[18:58] the others have really brought to the
[18:59] for that I'm really glad to see is very
[19:01] refreshing is even if you're a diehard
[19:04] number go up guy or girl the idea should
[19:08] still be that the only reason why you
[19:09] have that is because of the core value
[19:10] of bitcoin which we're talking about as
[19:12] money even on the mining side is not
[19:14] necessarily because it's fixed etc it's
[19:17] really a case of providing you know uh
[19:20] value on the ground because of the whole
[19:21] process of security network itself but
[19:24] also even on the electrification side
[19:25] and subsidying you know uh some of these
[19:27] electrical projects. So I see those are
[19:29] core values that have to do with being a
[19:31] proper money and because of the how well
[19:33] built the protocols in terms of being a
[19:34] proper money for the 21st century that's
[19:36] really built. So I think honestly the
[19:38] financial freedom angle if it's taken
[19:39] out of Bitcoin then it becomes devoid of
[19:42] any sort of core value and honestly
[19:44] we're just going to keep getting random
[19:45] cycles of price action that's driven by
[19:48] things that have no fundamentals which
[19:50] historically speaking we know where that
[19:51] leads.
 You're also um a Bitcoin core
[19:54] contributor if I got that right.
 Yeah.
[19:58] How is when you have the focus on on
[20:01] money, does this change how you think
[20:04] about developing Bitcoin into the
[20:07] future?
 100%. And I think the way I see
[20:10] it played out is kind of a variety of
[20:11] ways, but there's like a common set of
[20:14] uh I guess aspects that it kind of
[20:15] manifests into. So primarily you would
[20:18] see if you're shifting your focus away
[20:20] from money towards just number go up
[20:22] you'll be more open and more keen to
[20:25] kind of open up some of the protocol or
[20:27] even some of the the aspects of the
[20:29] network itself towards maximizing use
[20:32] cases introducing unnecessary fragility
[20:34] just so you can again like I said
[20:36] maximize that whole number go up cuz if
[20:38] Bitcoin is able to do 10x more things
[20:41] than it can right now then most of the
[20:43] folks that are on the number go up side
[20:45] will be in favor of that given they
[20:47] assume you know whether rightly or
[20:49] wrongly that that's really where the
[20:51] core value of Bitcoin is as opposed to
[20:52] being a money. So it's kind of a chicken
[20:54] and egg like if you have money being the
[20:57] primary thing driving everything you're
[20:58] doing you'll be a lot more focused a lot
[21:00] more hesitant to introduce fragility
[21:02] needlessly into the protocol or even
[21:03] just the core tech versus if you don't
[21:06] care about the money side then truly
[21:07] there is no like ontological basis for
[21:10] the value that Bitcoin is driving. So it
[21:12] becomes an easier argument for you to
[21:13] go, hey, let's just allow Bitcoin to do
[21:15] 10x more things, including things that
[21:17] are done in the crypto space that
[21:19] provide value. And that would be the
[21:21] core value proposition versus visibly,
[21:23] you know, money.
 Are you currently
[21:24] missing something in the in the Bitcoin
[21:26] infrastructure? Anything that you're
[21:28] like, okay, like we we should we should
[21:29] focus on that
 necessarily. I think we're
[21:31] in a all right state. I know, you know,
[21:34] it's been a lot of noise in the last
[21:35] couple of weeks on a variety of
[21:37] proposals, primarily the the whole oper
[21:40] situation and Bitcoin core's handling of
[21:41] it. And I definitely take a more nuanced
[21:43] view. Like I think a lot of people keep
[21:45] forgetting that core developers also
[21:47] hold and use Bitcoin. Like there's this
[21:49] assumption that they're essentially
[21:51] clocking in day and night to work on
[21:53] something that they're divorced from.
[21:54] But I can definitely tell you like
[21:56] interacting with core devs like they
[21:57] really care and probably even care the
[22:00] most compared to a lot of average folks
[22:02] about the trajectory of Bitcoin and
[22:04] still maintaining the eos of money. So
[22:06] I'm definitely optimistic with that side
[22:08] in terms of ensuring that you know the
[22:10] developers that are currently working
[22:11] the project are dieh hard fans of its
[22:13] core value proposition viv you know the
[22:16] whole number go up. So we're definitely
[22:18] in a stage where again there's a lot of
[22:19] noise because of the price action. A lot
[22:21] of people feeling like you know they
[22:23] want to be involved at every aspect or
[22:25] misrepresenting each side of the
[22:26] argument etc. But I think a lot of that
[22:28] would gradually you know wean off which
[22:30] we've seen with every price cycle. We
[22:32] see a lot of hype talk about a ton of
[22:34] proposals some get through some don't
[22:36] get through community feels like there's
[22:38] a divide between the concore and
[22:39] everything else etc. And then things get
[22:41] back to normal in terms of the long-term
[22:43] focus being maintained. Yeah,
[22:46] it's it's sad sometimes to to see it. I
[22:49] mean, the this up return it's it's it's
[22:52] less and less now as I saw it weeks ago
[22:56] like every day. um to the point where
[22:59] I'm like, "Oh, it gets a little bit to
[23:00] be annoying." But it is I I think it's
[23:03] great that
[23:06] Bitcoin is obsessing of those details
[23:08] and like Bitcoin is really obsessing
[23:11] about the smaller things that maybe look
[23:15] small but might have some big like the
[23:18] block size thing. uh like uh for for
[23:21] someone that doesn't know the full
[23:24] picture saying like oh like let's
[23:26] increase the block size a little bit
[23:28] they're like ah okay yeah it's what can
[23:30] go wrong uh
 exactly
 but if you really
[23:34] look at the whole picture of what that
[23:36] means of increasing the block size and
[23:38] opening that box of increasing the block
[23:40] size you're like oh maybe we should be
[23:43] very cautious with that. Uh so it's it's
[23:47] it's super interesting to have a
[23:49] community that is so passionate about
[23:52] all those small details because those
[23:54] small details make the whole thing run
[23:58] and make the whole thing perfect. Like
[24:00] it's fascinating that we still have
[24:02] Bitcoin like that we have the perfect
[24:03] money that just works and it's outside
[24:06] of the the fiat system. And for me the
[24:09] whole thing is a miracle. And this
[24:11] miracle is only possible because of the
[24:13] community obsessing about freedom. And I
[24:16] think that's the whole point of us
[24:19] getting back to money and this freedom
[24:21] technology and not being derailed and
[24:24] distracted.
[24:26] But I'm a go- technology. I think that's
[24:28] very key point. I like that a lot.
 No,
[24:31] for sure. I totally agree. And you you
[24:32] brought up a very very good point. It's
[24:34] very easy for things to unravel small
[24:36] piece after small piece and kind of get
[24:38] chipped away over time and then 5 10
[24:40] years from now we'll have a project that
[24:42] none of us recognize and none of us can
[24:44] use to the extent that we can today.
[24:47] Absolutely. Really interesting. Um I'm
[24:49] also interested uh on on how it is to be
[24:54] in this Bitcoin core developer group or
[24:57] like one of the contributors. Um did did
[25:00] you ever feel like pressure from outside
[25:03] or like uh h how is it being uh someone
[25:07] that is in this core contributor group?
[25:09] I mean just to give context like
[25:11] Bitcoin's development how would I say
[25:14] like the development crew in terms of
[25:18] Bitcoin is kind of like an onion like
[25:20] there different layers to it. like the
[25:21] outermost shell is essentially I think
[25:24] close to a thousand folks that have
[25:25] contributed just at least a single
[25:27] change that ranks from you know a quick
[25:30] fix all the way up to something really
[25:31] critical and then further away from that
[25:34] or into the onion itself or into the
[25:35] core is kind of a group of like a couple
[25:38] hundred that have done some follow-up
[25:41] changes as well and then even smaller
[25:43] group of like less than 100 that
[25:45] actively contribute like this is folks
[25:47] that are on a monthly basis pushing in
[25:49] code but also reviewing And then
[25:51] separate to that there are the core
[25:52] maintainers which is essentially five
[25:55] folks right now I think last time I
[25:56] checked which they essentially lead
[25:59] certain aspects of development. So
[26:00] whether it's the memp pool security the
[26:03] build system etc. So again we have this
[26:05] core five and then separate to that we
[26:07] have like a couple tens of developers
[26:09] that are actively involved every single
[26:11] month month out. Then we have a couple
[26:13] hundred that are even less involved and
[26:15] then all the way up to the thousand. So
[26:17] I definitely fall within the group of
[26:18] like the from the couple hundreds out.
[26:22] So mostly doing PR reviews etc. So I say
[26:24] the majority of the pressure honestly is
[26:26] within the the folks that are within
[26:28] like the couple tens all the way up to
[26:30] the maintainers cuz they're the ones
[26:31] most actively involved with actually
[26:33] pushing code and also reviewing changes.
[26:35] So in terms of even the last couple of
[26:37] weeks, you've seen I'm sure a handful of
[26:39] developers that have been kind of at the
[26:41] forefront or I guess at the the stick
[26:43] where people are shing you know pushing
[26:45] all the pressure on them to either make
[26:47] changes one way or the other or calling
[26:48] them out as like you know corrupt etc.
[26:51] So I think the pressure on my end is
[26:52] definitely not there compared to people
[26:54] that are actually closer to that that
[26:57] core group of people actually
[26:58] contributing
 for the few people and and
[27:00] it might be actually more than than we
[27:02] think that it's still a little bit newer
[27:05] to Bitcoin. How much power do those core
[27:09] developers actually have over Bitcoin? I
[27:11] mean it seems from the outside that
[27:14] there's a lot of power but the way
[27:16] Bitcoin development works again you know
[27:19] getting too much into the technicals or
[27:20] the weeds is a lot of the process is a
[27:23] lot more dynamic than like a flat top
[27:25] down structure. So even on a PR basis,
[27:29] the folks that do take lead on that,
[27:31] whether it's pushing the the request,
[27:33] you know, forward or keeping up with the
[27:35] author, etc., isn't always necessarily
[27:38] the maintainers. It's a lot of the times
[27:40] it's really the frequent contributors
[27:41] and folks that have expertise on that
[27:43] particular change that's been, you know,
[27:45] proposed. And then I'd say in terms of
[27:47] the power, it doesn't manifest as
[27:50] like a small cabal of people, especially
[27:52] the maintainers, meeting in secret shady
[27:54] rooms and kind of deciding the future of
[27:56] the project. It's really a case where
[27:58] it's more of a janitorial role where the
[28:00] reason why they're there is because one,
[28:02] they're have gained the trust of the
[28:03] ecosystem given the transparency and
[28:05] openness that they've had and the track
[28:06] record through the years, but also
[28:08] because of their competency with regards
[28:10] to that aspect of Bitcoin. So whether
[28:11] it's on the mining side, on the network
[28:13] side, the cryptography, etc. So all of
[28:16] that plays a role in terms of how the
[28:18] community views and kind of values their
[28:19] thoughts and the error correction system
[28:22] or mechanism within you know the
[28:23] development process is
[28:26] essentially kind of three-fold. So one
[28:28] would be if there's ever a stage where
[28:30] these folks feel like you know the wider
[28:32] group of contributors feel like these
[28:34] guys are corrupted or even one or two
[28:36] have been corrupted there are mechanisms
[28:38] in place to kind of boot them out
[28:40] whether it's you know revoking keys etc.
[28:43] And it's kind of a thing where the game
[28:46] theory plays out this way. The more time
[28:48] you spend as a contributor at that level
[28:50] in terms of being a maintainer, the more
[28:52] you have to lose in terms of trying to
[28:54] go the other way around of either being
[28:56] corrupted or changing cuz you spent all
[28:58] these years building up to that point of
[29:00] both competency but also trust with the
[29:02] ecosystem. So it's kind of a
[29:03] counterintuitive thing to do. And if you
[29:05] do do that, historically you've seen
[29:07] what happens whether it's you know with
[29:08] Gavin or some of the others that were
[29:09] booted out of the development process.
[29:11] So rest assured for folks that are
[29:13] listening, Bitcon has a really robust
[29:16] mechanism for sorting that out and
[29:18] obviously things could get better and
[29:19] over time I think they will. But yeah,
[29:21] it's definitely not a case where these
[29:22] guys are going to get corrupted or
[29:23] funded by one or and then things just
[29:25] get derailed. The first time I ever made
[29:28] any money, I got myself from that money
[29:30] a watch. And ever since then, I collect
[29:32] time pieces to remember times where I
[29:35] achieved some milestone. That's why I
[29:38] got the Bitcoin 2025 edition when I went
[29:41] to my first ever American Bitcoin
[29:44] conference. So for me, the Bitcoin
[29:46] watches from Coin Vilan represents the
[29:49] time that we are living in. For every
[29:50] person that wears a Bitcoin watch, I
[29:53] know they are representing sound money
[29:57] to the outside world. Make sure to check
[29:59] out those amazing coin vigilante time
[30:02] pieces down in the descriptions. I love
[30:05] those watches so so much. The most
[30:08] important thing for your Bitcoin journey
[30:10] is not buying Bitcoin, but it's how to
[30:13] keep them. And yes, you have maybe the
[30:15] right tools, but how do you actually go
[30:17] ahead and stick it all together so it's
[30:20] the most secure for you personally?
[30:23] Self- custody is a deeply personalized
[30:25] journey and the Bitcoin way is helping
[30:27] you exactly finding that correct setup
[30:31] for you personally. They're also helping
[30:33] you with securing your own cyber
[30:36] security. And if you want to go one step
[30:38] above all that, you can even get a
[30:41] consultation for a plan B residency. Go
[30:45] to the bitcoinway.com/roin
[30:49] and you will get a 30inut free
[30:52] consultation. I know how big of a hurdle
[30:54] it can be to have self-custody, but it's
[30:58] so freaking important to make that first
[31:00] step. But we have to make sure it's as
[31:03] easy and simple as possible. And that's
[31:06] exactly what Bitbox did. Bitbox created
[31:09] the simplest and the easiest hard wallet
[31:12] to use to get into self custody. So get
[31:16] yourself a Bitbox down from the link in
[31:18] the description. And when you use code
[31:20] Robin, you even get a 5% discount. And
[31:24] then there is the whole point of like
[31:28] full nodes deciding what what software
[31:30] they actually are using and and um uh
[31:35] the the network of full node operators
[31:39] compare and all the other aspects of the
[31:41] decentralization of of of Bitcoin kind
[31:44] of playing together and making it so
[31:47] indestructible but still
[31:50] still still moldable. So we we have a
[31:54] way of ensuring that if there's
[31:57] something coming up, we can change that
[31:59] and we can mold Bitcoin. So it's a it's
[32:02] kind of this balance. It's it's
[32:04] decentralized enough to be secure
 but
[32:07] not so decentralized that we cannot do
[32:09] anything because we have everything uh
[32:12] and maintain Bitcoin somehow. It's an
[32:14] interesting balance to to go because you
[32:16] don't want Bitcoin to change every week
[32:19] and and kind of like be like an a
[32:22] software project that that that yeah
[32:24] like it's down like a day it's okay. Um,
[32:27] but you also don't want it to completely
[32:29] stop every aspect of it because you
[32:34] there might be there are bugs to fix
[32:36] always, but there might also be a future
[32:39] thing that we have to to build in there
[32:41] otherwise Bitcoin might not work
[32:44] properly in the future. So even look
[32:46] like 50 100 years in the future. So it's
[32:48] an interesting balance actually.
 No,
[32:50] exactly. Exactly. Definitely hit it hard
[32:52] on on the head. I think another aspect
[32:55] that's interesting is
[32:57] like it's it's not a case where people
[32:59] as soon as a change is proposed and like
[33:01] it's merged into the repo and like let's
[33:03] say a new version is out like that time
[33:05] between people being aware of the new
[33:07] version and updating takes quite a while
[33:10] cuz again miners have to update full
[33:12] node operators have to update etc. Folks
[33:14] that are running merchant software
[33:16] typically takes around 6 months to even
[33:17] get that in. And so even if you do have
[33:19] a malicious um code change, you already
[33:21] have a mechanism of that wait time
[33:23] before people actually update. And
[33:24] already the community given how
[33:26] incessant everyone is about all the
[33:27] changes that go through will likely flag
[33:29] it. I think the quickest updates you
[33:31] likely see within the space over the
[33:33] last couple years have been or I should
[33:34] say historically have been changes that
[33:37] have to do with uh bug fixes or security
[33:39] holes that were fixed in subsequent
[33:41] changes. Those are typically when people
[33:43] update a lot faster than the six-month
[33:44] window. But again, like you said, you
[33:46] don't want it to be a situation where
[33:48] there are way too many people involved
[33:49] with the process and there's really no
[33:51] mechanism for a path forward. At the
[33:53] same time, you don't want it to
[33:54] concentrate into a regular, you know,
[33:56] essentially a company, Bitcoin Core,
[33:57] Inc. dictating to everyone. So, there's
[34:00] definitely a mechanism that we have on a
[34:02] variety of aspects through the
[34:04] development cycle that I think provide
[34:05] that kind of robustness to the space.
[34:07] Awesome. Um, one aspect that I'm always
[34:10] curious is, um, uh, you're from Africa,
[34:12] right?
[34:14] Oh yeah. Nigeria.
 You you also Nigeria.
[34:16] You also live there currently.
 Oh yeah.
[34:19] That's where I'm based.
 Okay. How
[34:23] how is it in Africa? Because I feel like
[34:26] people out of Africa really get the
[34:28] actual value of Bitcoin like the
[34:30] grassroots. When I talk with normal
[34:33] people that are not in the Bitcoin
[34:35] community
 um on a in Austria, they
[34:39] usually see it as another investment.
[34:42] They usually see it as oh I diversify in
[34:45] Bitcoin because I have already stocks. I
[34:48] maybe have some real estate. I have this
[34:49] and that and I also want to have some
[34:51] crypto.
[34:53] that word
[34:56] and uh that but that's how the the usual
[35:00] people in my environment in Austria kind
[35:03] of see Bitcoin
[35:06] and nobody sees it as a medium exchange
[35:10] or like a cash thing or anything like
[35:12] that and I feel like that's different in
[35:14] Africa a lot different.
 Oh 100%. And I
[35:18] think so there are definitely two
[35:19] aspects to this cuz it's been a couple
[35:21] of years since these dynamics have
[35:22] played out in terms of folks outside of
[35:24] Africa not necessarily seeing the medium
[35:26] of exchange or like we've established
[35:28] like the core value of Bitcoin and it's
[35:30] more the consequence of that value.
[35:32] That's kind of what the perception is. I
[35:34] think here on the ground is very
[35:35] straightforward like I think it doesn't
[35:37] take too much convincing for people to
[35:39] know that things aren't working well
[35:40] whether it's on the money side, bank
[35:42] account, inflation, food crisis, etc.
[35:44] even wars in certain countries. So I
[35:46] think really for them it's a case where
[35:48] they're constantly in search of tools
[35:50] that work and cater to their immediate
[35:51] needs whether it's computing value
[35:53] through space time etc. And one of the
[35:56] things that's very important about kind
[35:57] of the Bitcoin value prop for a lot of
[35:59] them is there's actually no way for you
[36:01] to meaningfully engage in the world
[36:02] without necessarily spending money. So
[36:04] fundamentally a lot of them have the
[36:07] money problem as like a very fundamental
[36:09] problem that's tied to both their
[36:10] financial freedom freedom in general or
[36:12] even just being able to actually survive
[36:13] on a day-to-day and still be alive. So
[36:15] for a lot of them the the argument is
[36:17] very very straightforward that this is a
[36:18] tool that works for you basically all
[36:20] the options that you have right now. So
[36:21] they get it now from the outside like I
[36:23] said it's more a case of the consequence
[36:25] of that value that's being provided
[36:26] outside of you know uh the shores of
[36:28] Europe etc in places like Africa Latin
[36:30] America etc. And I think gradually we'll
[36:33] get a collapsing of the two worlds and I
[36:35] think that's going to play out in
[36:37] probably two to three ways. One primary
[36:39] way I think is based on some of the
[36:42] maybe some of the dynamics coming in in
[36:44] terms of regulation on the European side
[36:46] or even North America and some of the
[36:49] some of the things that would likely
[36:50] breach into freedoms that people
[36:52] naturally enjoy in those countries will
[36:54] likely start making them realize that
[36:56] Bitcoin is a useful tech that has this
[36:58] core tech that could protect them
[36:59] against that. And for others in terms of
[37:02] protecting themselves before it gets to
[37:03] that stage, Bitcoin is a very very
[37:05] useful tool for that as well. so they
[37:06] can get used to that and get into the
[37:08] frame of actually having their lives
[37:09] banked on Bitcoin before things get
[37:11] really wild. And I think the last one
[37:13] will likely just be a case where
[37:15] yes, things work, but they only work
[37:17] because you have no alternatives that
[37:19] are a lot better like wires and all of
[37:21] that. It's not like a lifestyle that
[37:22] allows you to communicate value
[37:24] instantly, cheaply, etc. So, they are
[37:26] facing the same issues. they're just
[37:27] facing it in a more stable long-term way
[37:29] if as opposed to Africa where there's so
[37:31] many dynamics that kind of points to all
[37:34] the things that are not working right
[37:35] now that you could seek an alternative
[37:37] really quickly. So I think we'll get to
[37:39] that point where Bitcoin will flatten
[37:41] out around the world in terms of being
[37:42] that core tech as the primary lens that
[37:44] people view it from as opposed to kind
[37:46] of the consequence of that um core tech
[37:48] providing value in pockets of the world.
[37:51] Do is is there also a lot of stable
[37:54] coins in in in Africa? This is like also
[37:56] like Bitcoin and and and stable coins
[37:59] kind of facilitating the financial
[38:01] things that uh they they need. Oh, 100%.
[38:05] And I'd say those two are kind of the
[38:07] the primary angle that people get into
[38:10] the digital realm in terms of like
[38:12] modern finance etc on the continent. And
[38:15] just for numbers uh in the last maybe 12
[38:18] months maybe 18. So roughly within the
[38:21] last Q4 2024 the numbers were around I
[38:24] think over 66% or so based on chain
[38:27] analysis numbers were both crypto both
[38:29] uh stable coins as well as bitcoin in
[38:31] terms of the the largest share of volume
[38:32] on the continent. So definitely a lot of
[38:34] people seeing use case for both. I think
[38:36] on the stable coin side just to let your
[38:38] listeners know like the primary use case
[38:39] for folks on the ground has been because
[38:42] there's so many tighten controls on US
[38:44] dollar access across multiple countries.
[38:46] One primary case being you know Nigeria
[38:48] where I'm from. A lot of people see USDT
[38:51] as very cheap access to US dollars that
[38:53] allows them to do all the things that
[38:54] they currently can do and that would
[38:56] require heavy KYC or even some aspects
[38:58] of having like a very curtailed version
[39:00] of a banking experience where they have
[39:02] limited access to US dollars and limited
[39:04] areas that they could actually bank with
[39:06] visd
[39:08] so much liquidity and you can
[39:09] essentially do anything you want in
[39:11] terms of just communicating that through
[39:12] a dollar um a dollarized version
[39:15] essentially. Stable coin is basically
[39:18] for me a CBDC.
[39:21] [Music]
[39:22] It definitely has those certain aspects
[39:24] in the sense there's a there's a central
[39:26] entity etc controls there. It's not like
[39:28] Bitcoin where it's decentralized etc. So
[39:30] I definitely see where you get that
[39:31] freebie.
 Yeah, it's I never saw it like
[39:35] that and and someone left it as a
[39:37] comment and I was like yeah like that's
[39:40] it's kind it's kind of what what a CBDC
[39:42] is. I mean maybe uh maybe even worse
[39:45] because some CBDC's are not connected to
[39:48] to states. So it's like you're not
[39:52] controlled by uh people that you voted
[39:55] for. You're controlled by people that
[39:57] haven't even be indirectly voted for.
[40:01] That's fair. That's fair. And I think
[40:03] it's it probably plays out because
[40:07] USDT is actually a translation of the
[40:08] dollar dominance. So in a certain way,
[40:11] the US dollar itself is technically a
[40:13] CBDC2 from that control capture aspect.
[40:15] So naturally makes sense that we we'll
[40:18] see that manifest as well in USDT. So
[40:20] again, it's just one of the many reasons
[40:22] why Bitcoin is just a far better
[40:24] long-term solution for a lot of people,
[40:26] especially when it comes to protecting
[40:27] against that capture.
[40:29] How is the enir going? Is it is that
[40:32] project still going on?
 I'll put it this
[40:34] way. If we were to launch uh an attempt
[40:38] where it'll be similar of like a diner
[40:40] myself and you I I think we'll probably
[40:42] get more traction in terms of adoption
[40:44] over the next few months than how the
[40:45] internet has been doing. Like that's how
[40:47] poorly it's been. I think it's for two
[40:50] aspects. I think one is very difficult
[40:51] to give a convincing argument on a
[40:53] currency that's really not necessarily
[40:56] holding up to scrutiny or even holding
[40:58] its value. I think the last two years
[41:00] we've had 70% of the currency devalued.
[41:03] you've had crises with regards to
[41:05] different iterations of the NERA. So
[41:07] both the physical ones, the digital ones
[41:08] as well as the inera. So really the nera
[41:11] is not necessarily the best performing
[41:12] fiat currency. So for average people,
[41:14] they don't see an additional value of
[41:16] having this current era that already
[41:18] doesn't work too well for them and then
[41:20] having to port to a different NAR that
[41:22] also has the same challenges but just in
[41:24] digital version. So I think really there
[41:26] are a lot of approaches that they could
[41:27] have taken of like converting existing
[41:30] all existing digital narrow to ener that
[41:32] would have been an approach to kind of
[41:33] on board everyone instantly where people
[41:35] would essentially have no way to escape
[41:36] that. But they kind of fragmented the
[41:38] two which is kind of why you see such
[41:41] low adoption numbers. But again it still
[41:43] goes back to the core fundamental issue
[41:45] even if they got the roll out right like
[41:46] NAR is still not a good convincing
[41:48] argument for a variety of individuals.
[41:49] So I think right now the kind of the
[41:52] government side the next steps and kind
[41:54] of how they're approaching this I feel
[41:55] is a lot more productive like they
[41:57] definitely have the frame of mind that
[42:00] they'd like to fix the economic
[42:01] situation here in the country but the
[42:03] challenge that they face is multiple
[42:05] dynam dynamics on multiple fronts so
[42:07] whether it's FX whether it's you know
[42:08] the relationship between Bitcoin etc
[42:11] probably having reserves in Bitcoin as
[42:12] well and kind of how that plays even on
[42:14] the mining side. So right now ner the
[42:17] nation is very complex but suffice to
[42:19] say bitcoin is legal tender now well
[42:21] it's not legal tender but is officially
[42:23] accepted as a security in Nigeria for
[42:25] example and the next phase of kind of
[42:27] how they're planning to roll this out
[42:28] and kind of fix all these issues is
[42:31] bridging or should I say balancing out
[42:33] having an enabling environment for all
[42:35] this bleeding edge technology to thrive
[42:37] but also ensuring that FX and everything
[42:39] is kind of curbed and also maintained at
[42:41] a level where the nera is sustainable
[42:43] long term and can get back to levels
[42:45] that makes it a lot more economically
[42:47] viable as an actual currency for average
[42:49] people.
[42:51] Interesting.
[42:53] I'm I'm really curious how because I see
[42:57] um I see
[43:00] it's a maybe it's a wild comparison, but
[43:01] I see Fiat and all the effects of Fiat
[43:06] as the Blu-ray
[43:09] from going from analog to digital. So
[43:13] going from gold to Bitcoin, we just had
[43:15] that weird moment in time where we had
[43:18] fiat currencies. It's the same way of
[43:20] like proposing, you know, like I have
[43:23] this amazing technology. It's Blu-ray.
[43:26] Um but then there's digital music and
[43:28] digital films and there's Netflix coming
[43:30] and now you're like now you're mad
[43:32] because you have to pay $10 per month to
[43:36] get all the movies and all the series at
[43:40] any time you want.
[43:42] uh just a few years ago or like a decade
[43:45] ago, you paid for one movie $10 and you
[43:50] couldn't or you have rented for like $2
[43:53] and you could only use it for like a
[43:55] day. Um or you had to go to a physical
[43:58] store and get it. I I'm too young for I
[44:01] never really I never really did that.
[44:03] I'm too young for that. But um for me,
[44:08] Blu-ray is the same as a Fiat, just that
[44:12] the the the years are way longer because
[44:16] it's money and money just needs way
[44:18] longer to develop. That's why I'm so
[44:20] fascinated how quick the development
[44:22] with Bitcoin is. Like all around the
[44:25] world, people use it. I I earn 75% of my
[44:29] income already in Bitcoin and already
[44:31] give some of my expenses in Bitcoin. So
[44:34] I already am uh partially on a full
[44:37] Bitcoin standard also for medium
[44:39] exchange side of things not unit of
[44:41] account because it's hard but medium
[44:43] exchange at least. Um so I don't know
[44:46] like do do you do you see it also that
[44:49] like that that we we're kind of on this
[44:51] weird phase where we have to deal with
[44:53] fear even though we know it's just a
[44:55] temporary solution to uh go gold going
[44:59] global.
[45:01] No, 100%. And I think again you put it
[45:04] perfectly. I think it's the difference
[45:06] between the two is kind of captured in
[45:07] not just the paradigm shift, but the
[45:09] mechanism that's introducing the
[45:10] paradigm shift, which is software money
[45:13] essentially, which is what Bitcoin is.
[45:15] And that's why you've seen the
[45:16] difference between the development cycle
[45:18] of Bitcoin just being way, way faster
[45:21] than traditional fiat cuz there's just
[45:22] so many analog systems that have to be
[45:25] updated, but also revamped for it to
[45:27] actually have any changes. I think what
[45:29] we'll likely see in the mid to short
[45:31] term would be I think a lot of countries
[45:35] that still want to make sure they
[45:37] preserve their dominance of their fiat
[45:39] currency whether locally or even
[45:40] globally with the US etc. we'll have to
[45:43] contend with approaching Bitcoin a lot
[45:46] more concretely and a lot more
[45:47] holistically in terms of whether it's
[45:48] the reserve side, whether it's the
[45:50] mining side, whether is as a some sort
[45:53] of a quasi medium of exchange to a
[45:54] certain extent. And that's the only way
[45:57] I feel they can be competitive cuz the
[45:58] thing is with Bitcoin because of
[46:00] software, it's already global from day
[46:01] one. So there's no putting your head in
[46:03] the sand and kind of waiting and see if
[46:05] it's, you know, something that you would
[46:07] have to get involved with over time
[46:09] because the moment you're taking all
[46:11] this time to think about it, people are
[46:12] already adopting it around the world and
[46:14] being way more competitive than you. So
[46:16] I think there's the cat is out of the
[46:17] bag, I think a lot of countries, as
[46:19] we've seen over the last few years, have
[46:20] continued to take it a lot more
[46:22] seriously. I think we're getting to that
[46:23] next epoch of even more countries taking
[46:25] it more seriously and further pushing us
[46:27] to that next phase of adoption, which I
[46:29] think will also introduce nation states,
[46:31] not just average individuals on the
[46:32] ground. And I think in terms of fiat, I
[46:35] don't really think the next 50 years,
[46:37] we'll see no fiat anymore and just be
[46:39] full-on Bitcoin. I think it'll likely
[46:41] just be a translation of a lot of
[46:44] dynamics on the ground that involve
[46:45] Bitcoin heavily, more heavily than we
[46:47] have it currently. So you likely have
[46:49] Bitcoin being a mainstay as like the
[46:51] conventional currency that people use
[46:53] around the world to ensure that they're
[46:54] stay connected. So the same way people
[46:56] use the internet and still live in
[46:57] different parts of the world is how I
[46:58] feel Bitcoin will still be you know the
[47:00] currency that people use around the
[47:01] world but also likely use local
[47:03] currencies as well.
 That's the thing
[47:05] that I think also a lot of people don't
[47:06] get the the adoption rate and the speed
[47:09] is different in different parts of the
[47:11] world. there are and probably in Africa
[47:15] um a lot uh villages where there's no
[47:18] electricity and if you talk if you talk
[47:21] with someone from Austria like oh like
[47:23] there's no electricity like oh like if
[47:25] if there's
[47:27] so funny if electricity is gone for like
[47:31] two three hours in Austria it's all over
[47:35] the news people freak out people
[47:38] completely lose their mind they're like
[47:40] we're going down like the the the world
[47:42] is ending, like all of those things. Um,
[47:46] not all of them. There are some people
[47:48] that are, of course, it goes down here
[47:50] and there. Um, but I I've met some crazy
[47:54] people. Uh, and and then we have to
[47:57] remember there there are parts in the
[47:58] world where there just is no electricity
[48:00] and then there never was. And the same
[48:04] is probably true for for Bitcoin and for
[48:06] the internet. uh where I'm like okay at
[48:09] some point we there there will be
[48:11] countries and cities where there's
[48:13] Bitcoin so vibrant and so dominant that
[48:16] you cannot live without it there but
[48:18] then there are parts of the world where
[48:20] it's barely barely getting adopted and
[48:22] barely there. Uh so that that's that's a
[48:26] fun um a fun observation there uh to
[48:29] make that technology really drives
[48:33] different depending on on where you you
[48:37] live and where you have born.
 Oh
[48:39] definitely like I think technology just
[48:40] meets you at the the current demands or
[48:42] needs that you have presently which is
[48:44] why it just resonates so much more with
[48:46] parts of the world where there's so much
[48:47] fragmentation on availability
[48:49] electricity access etc. And I think
[48:51] honestly it's probably going to be why
[48:54] MCO will still be around for the next
[48:56] couple hundred years. The folks that
[48:58] really need it right now will continue
[49:00] to ensure that it stays that way of
[49:03] actually providing that core value that
[49:04] we keep talking about. And I think
[49:06] having development driven by those who
[49:08] care about it the longest, which will
[49:10] likely be folks from this part of the
[49:11] world, will help protect everyone else
[49:12] around the world in the sense that that
[49:14] whole noise factoring in as part of
[49:16] derailing the development process won't
[49:18] be a thing. will really be driven by
[49:20] both the innovation and the need on the
[49:21] ground and again like you said with
[49:23] Bitcoin is very interesting like people
[49:25] there are the electricity issues on the
[49:26] ground etc but the very fact that this
[49:29] tool also is a mechanism to address that
[49:31] while providing a money that works is
[49:34] probably one of the most novel things
[49:35] about it that is going to continue to
[49:37] resonate on the ground
 it's also
[49:40] um
[49:41] Bitcoin mining kind of helps
[49:43] electrifying uh parts of the world it's
[49:46] it's funny how how this goes full circle
[49:48] of Bitcoin helping actually getting
[49:53] you're aware of that right that bitcoin
[49:55] is helping electrifying bitcoin mining
[49:57] is electrifying the the world kind of
 no
[50:00] 100% and I think is also democratizing
[50:02] the energy markets globally and I think
[50:04] it's going to play a very critical role
[50:06] on how other parts of the world that
[50:08] have tremendous amount of energy
[50:10] reserves could monetize and also
[50:11] participate more concretely with the
[50:13] global energy market in terms of both
[50:14] either selling compute as a mechanism to
[50:16] transfer that energy making it
[50:18] productive or even just electrification
[50:20] like you mentioned is going to be a very
[50:21] very important component.
[50:24] Interesting. Yeah. Fascinating topic. I
[50:26] I I love always the the view of uh uh I
[50:30] I don't know. I I I weirdly enjoy
[50:34] Africans views on on Bitcoin. They have
[50:36] such an just a grounded grassroots uh
[50:40] few on Bitcoin. And it's always great to
[50:43] to have that because sometimes um people
[50:45] are getting too grazed with the store of
[50:47] value.
 Yeah. Yeah. that too too just too
[50:50] focused on that and number technology
[50:52] because that's all they care about and
[50:55] it's good like I think we need those
[50:57] people also as we need all of the voices
[50:59] in in Bitcoin and that's the whole game
[51:02] theory like everyone is talking about
[51:04] Bitcoin different people different parts
[51:06] of the world is talking about Bitcoin
[51:07] and as long everyone is talking about it
[51:09] like it gets adopted and the freedom of
[51:12] aspect is going up the uh the number is
[51:15] is going up and and all all the things
[51:17] of Bitcoin is going up And as long as
[51:19] there's enough narratives fighting each
[51:21] other,
[51:23] Bitcoin Bitcoin is is is there to to to
[51:26] to give us the that gift of money.
 100%.
[51:30] 100%. And in the framing of, you know,
[51:32] like like Jeff Booth mentions is around
[51:35] abundance, etc. is Bitcoin providing
[51:38] both money solutions but also energy
[51:40] solutions. I think it's it places it us
[51:42] squarely as civilizational like a as a
[51:45] civilizational tool in my opinion which
[51:47] is very very useful for us to continue
[51:49] to keep getting engaged with it from all
[51:51] these various voices and angles like you
[51:53] mentioned and again if it is
[51:55] civilizational tool then we're likely
[51:57] going to have this game theory play out
[51:58] in a way that's most beneficial and most
[52:01] in the way that would point it towards
[52:02] being antifragile over time.
 Yeah, 100%.
[52:06] Um,
[52:08] we have one question in the the podcast
[52:10] that I ask every one of my guests and
[52:12] the question is, "What can we learn from
[52:14] you besides Bitcoin?"
 I mean,
[52:18] I say maybe
[52:20] some of the some of the things outside
[52:22] Bitcoin will probably be around like
[52:24] just dealing with life, adversity, and
[52:26] kind of just continue to weather the
[52:28] storm, but also being principled. Uh,
[52:31] I'd say having
[52:34] being very very disciplined around kind
[52:36] of what you pay attention to, what you
[52:38] devote your time to, having your
[52:40] priorities in order, etc. I think is
[52:42] probably one of one of the other things
[52:44] I'm always definitely happy to share
[52:45] about and things that I've kind of
[52:46] learned over time just operating as a
[52:48] human being.
 How do you decide where you
[52:52] put your focus? Like how do you have a
[52:54] framework of like, okay, like where to
[52:57] put the focus?
 Oh, yeah. And it's down
[52:58] to without getting too much into
[53:01] philosophy and things like that, but
[53:02] essentially the base set of principles I
[53:04] have are around you know ensuring you
[53:06] provide uh as much value as possible,
[53:08] ensuring you kind of project the good
[53:10] you'd like to see in the world primarily
[53:11] from yourself outwardly into the world
[53:14] etc. And in terms of how I decide to
[53:17] kind of push my focus is definitely to
[53:19] make sure that it aligns with that
[53:20] overall goal. I'm trying to provide as
[53:22] much value as possible in the direction
[53:24] really that has points us into more you
[53:27] know principle kind of stoic like
[53:29] principles on how how to lead a life u
[53:32] devoiding ourselves of the ego etc. So
[53:35] really those are kind of the things that
[53:36] point me towards that which is why the
[53:38] aspects of Bitcoin that I really focus
[53:40] on have to do with that maintaining it
[53:42] as a generational tool I'll still be
[53:43] around but also ensuring that it helps
[53:45] you kind of remove yourself from all the
[53:48] noise and issues with regards to the
[53:50] world whether it's fiat you know
[53:52] interest or you know inflation etc. Once
[53:55] you have this type of tool that
[53:56] addresses a lot of that noise, you know,
[53:58] have an abundance of time or even more
[54:00] time to kind of think about yourself,
[54:02] you know, introspect, kind of develop as
[54:04] a better human being, kind of grow, etc.
[54:07] So, naturally, those are the things that
[54:08] kind of keep me up at night and kind of
[54:10] drive my focus in terms of where I land
[54:11] in the space.
 I love that. I love that.
[54:14] And our end routine is uh so soothing
[54:17] today. Um, we have a end where the
[54:19] previous guest is asking a question for
[54:20] the next guest without knowing who the
[54:22] next guest actually is. I just ask you
[54:24] the question, what is the best life? And
[54:27] it never gets so so generic question,
[54:30] but like that that is a is a very
[54:32] generic one. What is the best life
[54:34] advice you have ever gotten?
[54:37] It's very interesting. It's I think is
[54:39] probably
[54:40] it probably probably boils down to a
[54:43] quote I got from or I read I should say
[54:45] from Seka's shortness on life where the
[54:49] quote essentially is that it's not that
[54:51] life is too short is that we waste much
[54:53] of it and I think that really nails down
[54:55] to kind of guiding light for me in terms
[54:57] of how I navigate that it's very easy to
[55:00] say things happen so quickly and you
[55:02] didn't have time etc but it's very very
[55:04] difficult to narrow down and see the
[55:06] things that you're spending your time
[55:08] that you shouldn't be spending your time
[55:09] on that could be better spent on whether
[55:11] it's introspection or other things that
[55:12] have to do with development and growth.
[55:15] Yeah. The whole notion of life is too
[55:17] short is like
[55:19] of course you want more time
 but you
[55:23] have to work with what you got like
[55:26] exactly it's but it's it's everyone and
[55:30] so life is not too short. Life is just
[55:32] life and uh maybe you're just wasting
[55:35] too much of your time.
[55:37] Exactly. Exactly. So, I say that's
[55:39] definitely the guiding principle on my
[55:40] end or the the best advice.
 I love that.
[55:43] Really cool. Thank you so much. Uh Abu
[55:46] Baka, did I say that correct?
 Amazing.
[55:50] Uh sometimes it's it's it's hard. I have
[55:52] I have over 500 guests and and sometimes
[55:54] I struggle with names. I'm so sorry
[55:56] about that. I think for for being on the
[56:00] podcast before I let you go, where can
[56:02] people find you, ask you questions and
[56:03] reach out to you?
[56:05] Yeah, definitely on Noster. My username
[56:07] as well there is I hate 1999, same as on
[56:09] X. Other than that, besides, you know,
[56:12] socials, I think will be very useful or
[56:15] uh helpful for folks in terms of just
[56:17] looking at what's happening on the
[56:18] ground is keeping track with my Forbes
[56:20] column that I write.
 Wait, I hate 1999.
[56:23] Why? Why do you hate that?
 I was born
[56:25] then. I joined X when I was really
[56:27] really young. So, I assumed maybe some
[56:29] emo phase I was in. thought that was
[56:31] cool, but now I'm kind of stuck with it.
[56:33] So you're So you're born in 1999.
 Yeah.
[56:37] And ironically hate it when I was a kid.
[56:39] So it is what it is. Consequences of
[56:42] joining social media when you're young.
[56:44] Kind of deal with the consequences down
[56:45] the line.
 Yeah. I I'm I'm so happy that
[56:50] as a small boy, I was for some reason
[56:54] not creative enough to think about any
[56:57] username. So I always just used my real
[56:59] name. And people are going mad. I use my
[57:02] real name everywhere. Uh all all social
[57:06] media like of course all social media
[57:08] platforms like you can literally on
[57:10] every platform just go in and search the
[57:12] username Robin. It's the same same
[57:14] written like here and you find me. It's
[57:16] it's usually my profile. Um
 I definitely
[57:20] wish I did that.
 But but I even did it
[57:23] for video games.
[57:26] Really? So like your gamertags and all
[57:28] that is your actual name? everything.
[57:30] So, if I'm not playing a lot of video
[57:32] games, but for example, I I play chess a
[57:35] lot and and on chess.com, my username is
[57:37] also Robin Sia, the same as on Twitter.
[57:40] Uh and and everywhere I I go, I I
[57:43] usually always have my username just my
[57:45] full name. Like, I don't care. It's like
[57:48] that that that's who I am.
[57:50] I mean it helps maximize the
[57:52] searchability or the success of actually
[57:54] getting you online on these platforms.
[57:56] But obviously there is the contention of
[57:58] there's no way back from that. You can't
[58:00] make a name out of that. So definitely
[58:03] fully doxed.
 But yeah, but as soon as
[58:06] you put I think as soon as you put your
[58:08] name out there in the internet connected
[58:11] with a video and and pictures, you're
[58:14] doxed. And yet there are degrees to
[58:18] doxing. Like I I I dox myself every
[58:21] freaking day on the podcast.
[58:24] Uh so I do the best I can to dox myself.
[58:29] Uh but but there's degrees to to to
[58:33] that. Uh it it's it helps with
[58:35] searchability. Yeah. I even got Google
[58:38] page recently like that. That was really
[58:41] Yeah. I I don't know why honestly. I
[58:44] have uh maybe I can uh it's not it's not
[58:48] a good one. It's not looking good
[58:49] unfortunately. I think I have to suggest
[58:52] some changes. Uh
 but it's a good start.
[58:55] It's definitely a good start.
 It's a
[58:57] it's it's a start. Wait, here you can
[59:00] see it. It's
 It's Yeah. Yeah.
 But two
[59:05] times the same picture and I'm like and
[59:07] and this also is so funny. It's like Oh.
[59:10] Oh, it's already happened. Well,
[59:11] definitely captures it, I guess.
 True.
[59:13] True. But yeah, thank you so much uh
[59:16] with that small tea tour of uh
[59:18] searchability and and and and being on
[59:21] Google. Thank you so much uh Abu Baka uh
[59:26] to to be on the podcast. Um yeah uh and
[59:30] also thank you so much for everyone that
[59:31] is watching and listening for joining us
[59:33] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
[59:35] with another episode. Bye-bye.
