[00:00] you're a Bitcoin purist and it's the
[00:02] best way to go honestly or you're
[00:04] leveraging. If you're going with a
[00:05] treasury company, you're leveraging. So,
[00:06] to be real with you, I'm invested in the
[00:08] micro strategy products that are the
[00:10] heaviest levered with the intention to
[00:12] have the shortest time period possible.
[00:15] I have a mortgage, I've got student
[00:16] loans, I'm married, I have children,
[00:19] right? It's just a lot of
[00:20] responsibilities and and money is the
[00:22] answer to everything. It's not
[00:23] everything, but it's the answer to
[00:25] everything. But there's just this like
[00:27] deep thing in my soul. I'm not Robert
[00:29] Kayasaki. I hate debt. And before I know
[00:32] it, in just a short amount of time, I go
[00:34] from just being this very worried guy to
[00:36] all of the sudden, I'm like having this
[00:38] beautiful Christmas. My mind's just
[00:40] blown. I'm giving my family these
[00:43] beautiful gifts. And I've been a
[00:45] Bitcoiner ever since. So that's
[00:46] basically how I got into it. And I hope
[00:48] Bitcoin devours the real estate market.
[00:51] And I'm going to love it when it does.
[00:53] So I have invested since I was 16 years
[00:56] old. So, I've always played with stocks
[00:58] and and whatnot. Not on any kind more
[01:00] fundamental than than technical. Real
[01:02] estate is not an asset any longer,
[01:04] especially not your personal house.
[01:08] [Music]
[01:11] Hi, Derek. How you doing? Everything
[01:12] fine on your end,
 Robin. Everything's
[01:15] going great. I'm with you, man. It's a
[01:16] great day. I woke up and just totally
[01:18] stoked to see and talk to you.
[01:21] Absolutely. Thank you so much, Ned. It
[01:23] it was the first time around so good
[01:26] with you and I was like let's let's do
[01:27] it again. Um but for the for the few
[01:30] people that haven't catched the first
[01:31] episode of of us give some background of
[01:34] who you are and and why you're excited
[01:35] about Bitcoin.
 Absolutely. I'll just
[01:38] dive right into my Bitcoin story. It was
[01:41] uh I go off of Christmases. So there was
[01:43] last Christmas and then the Christmas
[01:44] before. So less than basically two years
[01:47] in Bitcoin. I was in a situation where
[01:50] basically I had money, I had assets, but
[01:53] I noticed that I really wasn't getting
[01:56] anywhere and I needed to really change
[02:00] it up. And fortunately, just by in a way
[02:04] happen stance, serendipity, the exchange
[02:06] that I use, I I use Robin Hood. I've
[02:09] been a stock trader since I was 16. I'm
[02:11] 38. So, I have invested since I was 16
[02:14] years old. So, I've always played with
[02:16] stocks and and whatnot. not on any kind
[02:18] more fundamental than than technical. Uh
[02:21] but in any case, yeah, two years ago, I
[02:23] was just in a situation where I just
[02:24] noticed that my finances weren't really
[02:26] gaining any ground even after being a
[02:29] guy who's worked for 22 years. I've
[02:31] worked since I was 16. Um and just
[02:34] thankfully, I'm I'm on Robin Hood one
[02:36] day and you know, being a naughty
[02:38] Bitcoiner ride on an exchange, but it's
[02:40] where I got exposed to it. I see BTC and
[02:43] BTC had always been in my head for
[02:44] probably like three or four years prior
[02:46] to that and I'm very like open-minded
[02:49] and I love things that I don't
[02:50] understand. Um, but I looked at the
[02:53] chart of Bitcoin two years ago right
[02:56] before Christmas and I just really liked
[02:58] what it was doing because I had had the
[03:00] benefit of it running for over 10 years.
[03:03] So, I bought some and I actually bought
[03:05] quite a bit in my world. And I first got
[03:07] into Bitcoin when it was maybe just
[03:09] above 30,000. So, it was like just over
[03:12] 30,000. It was kind of coming off of
[03:14] that big dip that it had come off of.
[03:16] And lo and behold, right as I purchased
[03:18] it, I had just happened to be in where
[03:21] it went on a pretty nice run. And I go
[03:24] from in a matter of like a month, Robin,
[03:26] I go from worrying about my finances,
[03:29] worrying about I mean, I have a h I have
[03:31] a mortgage. I've got student loans. I'm
[03:33] married. I have children, right? It's
[03:36] just a lot of responsibilities. And and
[03:38] money is the answer to everything. It's
[03:39] not everything, but it's the answer to
[03:41] everything. And I hit this Bitcoin. It
[03:45] just goes on this awesome, beautiful
[03:47] run. And before I know it, in just a
[03:49] short amount of time, I go from just
[03:51] being this very worried guy to all of
[03:53] the sudden, I'm like having this
[03:55] beautiful Christmas. My mind's just
[03:57] blown. I'm giving my family these
[03:59] beautiful gifts. and I've been a
[04:01] Bitcoiner ever since. So that's
[04:03] basically how I got into it and it's
[04:05] just been less than 2 years.
 Amazing.
[04:08] Bitcoin as as the new tool for wealth
[04:10] creation. It's kind of the new almost a
[04:12] new American dream in in in a sense.
[04:15] 100%. Absolutely.
[04:18] You have also said um you've been a
[04:20] naughty Bitcoiner.
 Yeah. I got to
[04:23] confess. Dang it. You know what? It's
[04:25] funny cuz you come on to the show and
[04:27] you're thinking of all these things and
[04:29] you want to be righteous and you want to
[04:31] be like the the holy Bitcoiner and I'm
[04:33] doing all the right things, right? I'm
[04:35] running my own node. I'm doing all the
[04:38] things that all the people that come on
[04:39] your show talk about and I'm just like
[04:41] doing the opposite. Well, here's what
[04:42] happened, Robin. So, I went full like
[04:45] cold storage. I did learn how to put all
[04:48] my Bitcoin into cold storage. I wanted
[04:50] to learn that because I really liked I
[04:52] wanted to just play with it. I wanted to
[04:54] see how it moved and to see if it was
[04:56] legit. So, I did get all my Bitcoin off
[05:00] the exchange into cold storage for a
[05:02] good matter of months. And I think it's
[05:05] just the nature of like me. I'm just
[05:07] like a very uh I get bored and cold
[05:10] storage was like boring in a way. Good
[05:13] boring. I mean, I'm watching the wealth
[05:16] just go amazing for savings at this
[05:19] point, right? There's just no if you're
[05:22] just looking for a savings account that
[05:24] is just absolutely incredible. You buy
[05:27] Bitcoin, you put it in cold storage, and
[05:30] it just grows. I mean, you become a
[05:32] wealthy person. And the more you put in
[05:34] there, the more it grows. And when it's
[05:37] volatile, you thank the gods of
[05:39] volatility because you know it's going
[05:41] up in the other direction. I love the
[05:43] volatility because it's volatility up.
[05:46] But I digress. What ended up happening
[05:49] was uh well micro strategy ended up
[05:52] happening to me. Robin, you know what,
[05:54] man? You know what ruined me? If I would
[05:56] have just never if I would have just
[05:58] buried my head in the sand and the
[06:01] moment I had all my Bitcoin in cold
[06:02] storage, just kind of moved on with my
[06:04] life or put my intellectual power into
[06:06] actually something like righteous, like
[06:09] the node, like understanding the network
[06:11] better, turning it into a media of
[06:13] exchange, right? These are the righteous
[06:15] path. No, no. I went in the opposite
[06:17] direction because what ended up
[06:18] happening, I just got turned on to all
[06:21] these investors talking about the
[06:23] Bitcoin Treasury companies. And it
[06:26] actually happened because I after we
[06:28] spoke, I was inspired to start doing
[06:31] some YouTube content. I've always loved
[06:33] like content creation and had that spark
[06:35] in me. And I actually was making a
[06:37] little bit of Bitcoin content for just a
[06:39] little bit. And then in these comment
[06:41] sections, I get all these Micro Strategy
[06:43] people talking about like, well, do you
[06:45] think Micro Strategy is going to
[06:46] outperform Bitcoin Bitcoin? And it I'm
[06:49] like, I don't know. I don't even really
[06:51] know what what macro strategy is. So, I
[06:53] start doing my research. In any case,
[06:56] here's what I did, Robin. So, I've
[06:58] pulled Bitcoin out of cold storage in
[07:01] the last, you know, this year. I've
[07:03] pulled a lot of my Bitcoin out of cold
[07:05] storage and sold a lot of it. There you
[07:08] go. I confess I've sold Bitcoin. I'm I'm
[07:12] There it is, man. And put it in to Micro
[07:16] Strategy and some of Micro Strategies. I
[07:18] suppose the words derivatives. I've even
[07:20] gone into some of the more risky Micro
[07:22] Strategy products. But at least I have a
[07:25] reason. And here here's the reason why
[07:27] I've been a naughty Bitcoiner and sold
[07:29] my Bitcoin and invested in the Treasury
[07:32] Company, which I'm going with Micro
[07:34] Strategy personally. I know there's
[07:36] quite a few out there now. But the
[07:38] reason being if I can have some dignity
[07:40] left is, you know, I'm still trapped in
[07:43] the fiat world. Bitcoin has done very
[07:46] good for me and I have money now. I have
[07:49] I have I can liquidate it for fiat. I've
[07:52] never even had fiat until I had Bitcoin.
[07:54] I've just had nothing. Now I have at
[07:56] least Bitcoin plus the fiat. But I'm
[07:59] still trapped in debt. You know, I have
[08:02] hundreds and thousands of dollars of
[08:04] debt through literally a mortgage and
[08:06] student loans. That's my entire debt.
[08:08] But those are huge debt traps. And I'm
[08:10] grateful for them because I'm raising a
[08:13] family. I love having a home, but I
[08:15] didn't have 360K just in my back pocket
[08:18] to throw towards the house. So, I had to
[08:19] take out debt, right? And it's not debt
[08:22] that's gener. It's not an asset. Your
[08:23] house is no real estate is not an asset
[08:25] any longer, especially not your personal
[08:28] house. So, I've got this huge fiat debt
[08:30] I need to take care of. And I have
[08:32] hundred I have I'm a doctor, Robin.
[08:34] Granted, chiropractic. I'm a quack. But
[08:37] I have a bachelor's degree in human
[08:39] biology and I have a doctor's degree in
[08:40] chiropractic. And I'm grateful for those
[08:42] degrees because they've allowed me to at
[08:44] least I work with the degree. I really
[08:47] feel for people who can't use their
[08:48] degrees. My degrees have given me work
[08:51] and very meaningful work as both a first
[08:54] a chiropractor and then actually after
[08:55] chiropractic. A couple bad experiences
[08:57] with clinics I was working with led me
[08:59] to go to public education. All made
[09:02] possible because I'm educated. I'm able
[09:04] to raise a family because I have a house
[09:06] and I'm able to do some of the things
[09:08] I've loved because I'm educated. And
[09:10] that has come at a cost of great fiat
[09:13] cost. So, I digress. I have sold my
[09:17] Bitcoin and put that fiat into the
[09:21] treasury companies with the intention to
[09:24] run my fiat so high that I can just wipe
[09:27] out those debts, buy back into Bitcoin,
[09:31] and just take my my happy butt right
[09:33] back to cold storage and then and then
[09:37] well, you say if you don't say something
[09:39] if you actually intend to do it, but
[09:42] then go the more righteous path and
[09:44] actually start putting more time into
[09:45] being a proper Bitcoiner. But there's my
[09:48] confession.
[09:50] So you bought Micro Strategy to
[09:52] outperform Bitcoin. I think it's it's
[09:54] not a bad I think it's not a bad thing.
[09:56] It's like a personal like
[09:58] you know that obviously I personally
[10:01] prefer Bitcoin in self custody. I had
[10:04] Michael Sailor on my podcast. I was at
[10:08] the 100K party of Michael Sailor in his
[10:11] villa and to this day I never bought a
[10:14] Micro Strategy stock.
[10:16] So, I I feel like almost like I'm I'm
[10:19] the naughty micro strategy guy here that
[10:21] never bought I could have easily bought
[10:23] something. Um, but I just choose to
[10:26] always have everything in self custody
[10:28] in in cold storage. Uh, that's that's
[10:31] the way I roll. Um, but I love that we
[10:36] have so so many new options because like
[10:39] 2017 people did the same thing, but they
[10:44] did it with altcoins
[10:46] and I rather have people doing it with
[10:48] micro strategy or like with with some
[10:51] kind of product based on Bitcoin and uh
[10:54] not with altcoins. And I feel I feel
[10:56] like almost the the uh treasury
[10:59] companies stole a lot of thunder from
[11:02] the altcoins. Like this cycle I hear
[11:05] almost nothing from the alcoins. Like
[11:07] they they're so silent. Like there are
[11:09] some Ripple guys in the comment section,
[11:11] but they are just like plopping away.
[11:14] I'm like, "Okay, yeah, like if you want
[11:15] to be with the banks, be with the banks.
[11:18] Go go go down with the banks. It's okay
[11:20] for me." um and and nothing else like
[11:23] the Ethereum thing. I only hear people
[11:25] crying that their Ethereum went down.
[11:27] Yeah, obviously if you you should have
[11:30] listened to the Bitcoin axis. So I I
[11:32] don't I don't have anything against
[11:34] that. It's it's your own personal
[11:35] decision. Um but it's it's an
[11:38] interesting one. You you're still now
[11:40] mostly into Micro Strategy to like
[11:43] outperform Bitcoin over the next like
[11:45] five years. Do you have a like a plan of
[11:46] like, hey, like if I hit this, I I I
[11:49] sell back to Bitcoin or how do you look
[11:51] at that?
 Yeah, absolutely. And you know
[11:54] what, Robin, your grace, I I feel
[11:56] literally a weight off my shoulders. I'm
[11:58] like I'm literally talking to like the
[11:59] most legendary Bitcoiner. I know you're
[12:02] like the purest of pure straight paid in
[12:05] uh and I'm like, h I need to go on. I
[12:07] feel better now. Thank you, man. Thanks
[12:09] for the grace and the love.
[12:11] Honestly, I'm I'm going lightning fast
[12:13] because here's the thing, you know, uh
[12:15] micro strategy is leveraging, right?
[12:17] Really, you're either just you're a
[12:19] Bitcoin purist and it's the best way to
[12:21] go, honestly, or you're leveraging. If
[12:23] you're going with a treasury company,
[12:25] you're leveraging. So, to be real with
[12:26] you, I am I'm I'm invested in the Micro
[12:29] Strategy products that are the heaviest
[12:31] levered with the intention to have the
[12:34] shortest time period possible to make
[12:36] the most. I mean, I want to get out as
[12:39] soon as I hit that degenerate return.
[12:42] I'm looking for a degenerate return. And
[12:45] to be honest with you, and and the
[12:46] reason why it is better to be a
[12:48] Bitcoiner, because I'll I'll fully
[12:50] disclose this for anybody thinking of
[12:52] doing the strategy I'm using, you need
[12:54] to be first off so patient. And you have
[12:58] to realize it's called, you know, 2x
[13:01] long for a reason, 4x long for a reason.
[13:04] You almost have to go against the grain
[13:06] in the sense that like right now I'm
[13:08] down against if I had just held Bitcoin,
[13:10] especially this year for 2025.
[13:13] I had had these ho high hopes of like
[13:16] and I I know Bitcoin's always going to
[13:19] come through, which gives me the
[13:20] conviction. When you have the conviction
[13:22] in Bitcoin, it gives you conviction and
[13:25] leveraging. But man, you cannot you've
[13:28] got to have you got to either be a
[13:30] like me, like straight where you
[13:32] can just hold through the brutality.
[13:35] Because when I was just only holding
[13:37] Bitcoin, you're just in the green and
[13:39] you don't leave the green. The moment
[13:41] you start leveraging, you have to be
[13:43] able to stomach red and deep red because
[13:47] I've stomached some deep, devastating
[13:49] red this year. and just held through it.
[13:52] That's why it's called long, leveraging
[13:54] long. So, my strategy is as soon as it
[13:59] as the leverage plays out
[14:03] and and it's it's going to play out
[14:04] where either the next time we talk, I'm
[14:06] like, Robin, I went to zero. I had to
[14:09] start over. And you have to accept that.
[14:11] That's another thing I'm kind of jumping
[14:12] around. I'm just letting you know. I'm
[14:14] letting people know the mental process
[14:16] you have to accept if you're going to go
[14:17] this route. You have to first build a
[14:19] mental process that you're zero to a
[14:22] million because you're playing now the
[14:23] fiat games, right? Play and it's a
[14:25] stupid game. So you play stupid games,
[14:27] you win stupid prizes. So you have to go
[14:29] in with that mentality that hey, I'm
[14:32] leveraging. I'm either going to zero or
[14:34] I'm going to a million to accomplish a
[14:37] certain mission. So really that's my my
[14:40] strategy is uh to stick with the
[14:42] leverage, fight through the red. I'm
[14:45] pretty much back to about even and I saw
[14:48] some serious gut-wrenching red this
[14:50] year. But man, you can't as soon as you
[14:53] blow the plan, you're done. You're
[14:54] cooked if you you got to see it through
[14:56] if you're going to leverage. And the
[14:58] Bitcoin has your back, interestingly
[15:00] enough. So, I'm going to let it play
[15:02] out. The goal is to uh as soon as I hit
[15:05] that fiat number that show that that the
[15:09] thesis plays out and I've outperformed
[15:12] the Bitcoin for the purpose of
[15:14] eliminating all these liability debts.
[15:17] And I actually spoke with some very
[15:20] educated people on hey hold your hold
[15:22] your mortgage debt, right? It's just a
[15:24] and I have a pretty good interest rate
[15:26] and I even have a decent interest rate
[15:27] on my student loans. So, I could totally
[15:29] just hold those debts and just make that
[15:32] minimum interest payment and the Bitcoin
[15:34] could just outperform it. So, the cold
[15:35] strategy or the cold storage strategy
[15:37] would have worked even better. It's just
[15:39] a longer timeline. But, there's just
[15:41] this like deep thing in my soul. I'm not
[15:43] Robert Kaioaki. I hate debt. I've just
[15:47] grown to just hate fiat debt. I just
[15:49] even if it's stupid and I could play a
[15:52] better way, just having that out there,
[15:54] it just gnaws at me, man. It like just
[15:57] gnaws at me. So, I'm seeing this
[16:00] leverage through until either I'm zero
[16:02] or I have enough fiat where I could just
[16:04] erase that debt, buy myself back into my
[16:07] Bitcoin, and then move on with my life
[16:10] and just be a Bitcoiner and not have
[16:12] this fiat debt ball dragon behind on my
[16:15] leg. So, I'm out as soon as I can get
[16:17] out. But, I've had to be very patient
[16:19] and I've been in longer than I thought I
[16:21] would be because I started playing this
[16:23] out in January. To be honest, I started
[16:25] playing this out in January and now here
[16:27] we are in June, five months later and
[16:30] I've been slugging it out in the
[16:31] leveraging war. And there's a reason why
[16:33] only less than 3% of people make money
[16:36] with leverage because it'll test you,
[16:38] man. It'll test your guts. It'll test
[16:40] your uh your conviction in the play. And
[16:43] you're either going to zero or a
[16:44] million. So, if you're going to play
[16:45] leveraging, either you got to be like a
[16:47] genius or a And I'm a And
[16:51] but God has my back. Hopefully. Of
[16:54] course.
 Man, you're you're
 I'm nervous,
[16:57] man. But it's zero or a million. I got
[16:58] to get rid of this this liability that
[17:00] is just dragging me down. I need it
[17:02] gone.
 You're super entertaining. I I
[17:05] love that.
[17:07] Thank you, Robin.
 And and and it's I
[17:09] think it's um I have I have to paint
[17:12] that picture because like Bitcoin for
[17:15] most people is super volatile and super
[17:18] risky. Like I we understand and most of
[17:22] the audience understands Bitcoin has
[17:24] zero risk. H you just have Bitcoin in
[17:27] self-custody and the only risk is you
[17:29] you yourself up your self
[17:32] custody setup. That's the biggest risk
[17:34] basically there is. Um but then you look
[17:37] from the outside and you see the
[17:38] volatility of Bitcoin which has come
[17:40] down a lot. um might probably uh get
[17:42] more in in in near future I feel like
[17:45] but has come down over the past uh years
[17:48] but then you have micro strategy uh
[17:51] which has more volatility because it's
[17:54] basically a leverage bitcoin play but
[17:57] then there are leveraged products
[18:00] on the leverage product which is micro
[18:01] strategy uh so there is I I have like
[18:05] really almost zero clue about those
[18:07] things but I heard about MSDX I heard
[18:09] about strides It's strife and strike uh
[18:12] and all about those MST products
[18:15] products where you can have 2x leverage,
[18:17] 3x leverage and all those things. Uh I
[18:20] assume you have something like MSDX or
[18:22] something like that where you have some
[18:25] leverage. Um, but that's like you really
[18:29] have to be able to stomach that and
[18:33] seeing uh like put a level on the
[18:36] volatility and ask yourself could you
[18:39] handle not just minus 10 in a day but
[18:42] like minus 20 or minus 30 in a day
[18:45] because like could be there in a day
[18:47] like are you really that convinced not
[18:50] only in Bitcoin but also in Michael
[18:51] Sailor and the management team and you
[18:54] you really have to have a big conviction
[18:56] there. So, I I kudos to you,
[19:00] Robin. Thank you. And you know what?
[19:02] Thank you, man. Yeah, appreciate that.
[19:05] You know what? I'm a fool. And sometimes
[19:07] it works out for the fool. But again,
[19:09] you have to accept you have to accept it
[19:12] could go to zero. If you're not going to
[19:13] accept there's no there's this isn't a
[19:15] daydream. This isn't like if you can
[19:17] accept that you're going to go to zero,
[19:19] you just might make it through. But you
[19:21] know what's interesting about that
[19:22] volatility and the reason the reason I
[19:24] am leveraging right now because you made
[19:26] a good point how the volatility on
[19:28] Bitcoin is coming down and I think it's
[19:30] actually coming down pretty rapidly and
[19:32] I feel like uh if there was a time to
[19:35] make the leverage play it was now
[19:37] because I feel like uh that that
[19:39] volatility as the volatility on Bitcoin
[19:41] dies down the power of the leveraging
[19:43] dies down and I think these leveraging
[19:45] plays are going to start just being to
[19:48] the point where there's really just no
[19:49] point Um, I think we're at this point in
[19:52] time, and again, this is a
[19:54] speaking, but I think that we're in a
[19:55] point in time where you could still the
[19:57] leverage still means something in fiat
[19:59] terms. If you, again, you know, you have
[20:00] to play I have to play the fiat game. If
[20:02] you don't have debt, why play the fiat
[20:05] game if you don't have debt or if maybe
[20:07] if you're someone playing debt, but if
[20:08] you're someone like me that doesn't know
[20:09] how to play with debt like Robert
[20:11] Kiosaki plays with debt and debt to you
[20:14] is just a mortgage and student loans. If
[20:16] you don't have that, why play the game?
[20:18] Um, but the volatility on Bitcoin's
[20:20] coming down. So, I think the leverage
[20:22] play is is is not going to be something
[20:24] that is even worth it here soon. So, I'm
[20:26] really just I feel like I'm just trying
[20:28] to catch the tail end of of the leverage
[20:30] play while it works. But, you know, it's
[20:31] interesting about the volatility and
[20:34] this is a lot of like I've really
[20:36] appreciated. I've come to in life to to
[20:38] learn a lot about silver linings. Like I
[20:40] always look at life like there's always
[20:42] a lesson to be learned and you learn
[20:44] more on bad days than on good days. And
[20:46] you learn more on things that punch you
[20:47] in the gut or the jaw, right? And what's
[20:50] interesting is I've always been a very
[20:52] highly fearful person and a lot of
[20:54] anxiety. And it's crazy too cuz like
[20:56] I've been really pushed to always put
[20:58] myself out there like Marine Corps all
[21:00] all things are just test cuz I I hate
[21:02] being afraid and I grew up a lot of
[21:05] fear. I've always just been a very
[21:07] fearful person. And so I always go and
[21:09] try to do as most fearful things as I
[21:11] can to beat that. I just it drives me
[21:13] nuts that I have so much fear. But
[21:15] Bitcoin, the volatility, learning to
[21:19] roll with that has made me my my
[21:22] character has made me such a less
[21:24] fearful person that yesterday, Robin, it
[21:28] wasn't quite yesterday, but just not too
[21:29] long ago, I literally was driving down
[21:31] the road and I was at this stop and this
[21:34] car accident happens and my nerves are
[21:37] like so just dialed in now from being a
[21:39] not only a Bitcoiner, you first learn to
[21:41] be the Bitcoiner and you deal with the
[21:42] volatility there and now I'm leveraging
[21:45] with treasury companies. So then you
[21:47] learn to stomach that kind of, you know,
[21:49] nervous system rush. This car accident
[21:53] happens like right next to me. This guy
[21:55] explosion. Like these car I should have
[21:57] been involved. The cars were literally
[21:59] coming at me like death coming at me.
[22:02] And because I've my character has gotten
[22:05] so strong as a Bitcoiner going through
[22:09] these ups and downs and just learning
[22:13] that uh I guess the you know the word is
[22:15] volatility that I was like unfazed.
[22:18] I was unfased. It's just made me a
[22:20] stronger person. That's an extreme story
[22:22] but what I'm getting at is uh man it
[22:24] really builds your character Robin. Like
[22:26] I think anyone you get you get what is
[22:30] life right? It's it's t it's whatever
[22:32] you want it to be. But if you're looking
[22:34] for meaning, man, get into Bitcoin.
[22:36] It'll just build your character. It'll
[22:38] definitely build your toughness. It'll
[22:40] definitely give you guts. And you'll
[22:42] start just eyeing down anything that
[22:44] makes you afraid. You'll start eyeing it
[22:46] down more with a grin on your face
[22:49] instead of a panic. Instead of panic,
[22:52] you start to you become more of a an
[22:55] opportunist. You feel more just alive
[22:58] and and less shook. Uh, when you're a
[23:01] Bitcoiner, it's a great time to be a
[23:02] Bitcoin. It's a great time to be alive.
[23:04] It's It's almost a shame when the
[23:05] volatility's gone, it'll almost be it'll
[23:07] be beautiful because I think we'll we'll
[23:10] transition into it being a better medium
[23:12] of exchange and and all when the
[23:14] volatility dies down, it'll be probably
[23:16] it'll be more beautiful because all
[23:18] these things that need to play out and
[23:20] you know, the Bitcoin standard I think
[23:22] will will happen. But man, during these
[23:24] times of volatility, it's a beautiful
[23:26] time to be involved in it. It just
[23:28] builds your character.
[23:30] There's some rambling of a mad man for
[23:32] you.
 That's that's super interesting.
[23:35] And I I I rarely I think I maybe never
[23:39] thought about that on the podcast that
[23:41] Bitcoin obviously tests you uh
[23:44] volatility wise like obviously when you
[23:46] have Bitcoin and you have to stomach the
[23:51] volatility which is bad if you're not
[23:54] used to it seeing your wealth go up and
[23:57] down like if you have a thousand if you
[24:00] have one Bitcoin and this one Bitcoin is
[24:03] going up and down a few thousand, which
[24:08] it definitely does in dollars uh in a
[24:10] day. This means also you make and lose a
[24:13] few thousand a day, which can be quite
[24:17] nerve-wracking. If maybe you make, let's
[24:20] say, $3,000 a month and then Bitcoin,
[24:24] your Bitcoin is going down $6,000. You
[24:27] basically lost two months right there.
[24:30] So, this can be a very scary thing. But
[24:33] beyond even that, this is what forms a
[24:36] character. But beyond even that,
[24:39] your environment most likely calls you
[24:42] stupid.
[24:44] Your environment most likely says, "Oh,
[24:46] like why are you putting everything in
[24:48] in Bitcoin?" This additionally builds
[24:50] your character to be someone that
[24:55] goes against the mainstream in your
[24:57] inner circle and even and even trying to
[25:02] get them to understand the other side
[25:04] which also builds out your like sales
[25:08] things and like your your like human
[25:10] knowledge and soft skill things. uh you
[25:12] get that and there's so many interesting
[25:15] and then obviously we have the whole
[25:17] thing that we a lot of the times talk on
[25:19] the podcast you get to know about game
[25:21] theory politics and and all the other
[25:24] things but I think the character things
[25:25] are really interesting we we test out
[25:28] and create a character with Bitcoin
[25:30] because we're so so early to this game I
[25:34] I never thought about that that part of
[25:37] combined with character
[25:39] character building and with people
[25:42] calling you out and like calling you
[25:44] crazy and then also the volatility.
[25:46] That's that's super interesting. Thank
[25:47] you so much for for bringing that up,
[25:49] man.
 Yeah, thanks Robin. Well, I
[25:52] appreciate you listening always. It's
[25:53] just been my experience cuz I really and
[25:55] it's cool because anytime I get to talk
[25:57] to you, I really do a lot of reflection
[25:58] on like, wow, you know, why is it that
[26:01] I've never held a position longer than
[26:03] even I've never gone long on anything.
[26:05] Why am I still in Bitcoin? And it's
[26:07] like, God, it is the at the end of the
[26:09] day that deeper character creation. It's
[26:12] like my grandpa used to tell me like I I
[26:14] was a big time uh I wasn't big time, but
[26:15] I I wrestled in high school and he he
[26:17] would always come and anytime I'd lose
[26:19] it would losses always test your
[26:21] character more, right? Like red days
[26:23] test your character more. Like you were
[26:24] saying, if you're making 3K a month,
[26:26] Bitcoin dips 6K and all of a sudden
[26:28] you're down, you know, two full months,
[26:30] two full pay cycles. You know, it's
[26:32] those times where you grow an inch. you
[26:34] grow an inch and your character grows an
[26:36] inch and and I love the word volatility
[26:39] because it carries on to your whole
[26:40] life. I mean, I'm so much a I'm I'm such
[26:42] a better risk taker now that I've been a
[26:45] Bitcoiner and I I understand now more of
[26:49] the nature of like existence thanks to
[26:52] because Bitcoin is so pure. It's so
[26:54] pure. It's so like truthful. So whatever
[26:57] Bitcoin is doing is is probably the
[26:59] closest to truth that you can kind of
[27:01] study. That's why some people get like
[27:03] really religious about it. Even I was
[27:05] kind of going there. I almost had to
[27:06] like stop myself and like go pick up my
[27:09] Bible again and be like, "Whoa, whoa."
[27:11] Because I like Bitcoin is so much truth.
[27:13] It it could draw a religion to it. And
[27:17] that's really uh so when you when
[27:20] whatever Bitcoin's doing, there's
[27:21] lessons to be learned. And and the
[27:23] volatility has taught me that that's
[27:24] just existence and that's risk-taking.
[27:27] And maybe uh you know, this kind of
[27:29] plays into something else. It made me
[27:31] realize there's like hunters and there's
[27:32] gatherers.
[27:34] So, what was interesting about like I
[27:36] think that a lot of people are either
[27:38] gatherers or they're hunters. And I
[27:40] think the best people for Bitcoiners are
[27:43] almost the gatherers cuz they can put it
[27:44] in cold storage, right? And it's just
[27:47] kind of like the gatherer and the
[27:49] berries grow and the fruit grows and
[27:51] it's like not low risk once you
[27:53] understand it. You know, you don't
[27:55] you're at the village and you're just
[27:56] growing your wealth and it's calm. It
[27:59] kind of taught me that I have more of
[28:00] that like hunting in me. Like I need
[28:02] that that risk. I need that edge. I need
[28:06] to go out and hunt that mammoth. Uh and
[28:08] that's maybe why I'm even leveraging,
[28:10] right? Like I almost couldn't keep it in
[28:11] cold storage because it just couldn't be
[28:13] a gather. It taught me like who I am as
[28:15] a per really taught me who I am like the
[28:18] hunter. I got to go out and slay the
[28:19] mammoth. Uh maybe that's why I had a
[28:21] hard time just kind of keeping it in in
[28:23] cold storage. Uh, I think I'll I'll
[28:25] enjoy it more when you could spend it
[28:27] more easier and have it more of a
[28:29] Bitcoin standard and whatnot. Um, gosh,
[28:32] I had a couple other things, but my
[28:33] mind's going in a million directions.
[28:35] It's it it's it's super interesting what
[28:38] what what Bitcoin makes uh with us and
[28:41] how how Bitcoin also uh form society
[28:44] with the low time reference and all
[28:46] those things. But maybe like uh just
[28:48] briefly coming back uh to your plan
[28:50] because I think it's it's it's really
[28:52] interesting. Um, so you basically have
[28:54] the plan of like, okay, baying down
[28:56] adapt and as soon as you hit that, uh,
[28:58] you're like going back in cold storage
[28:59] and kind of trying to, um, use Bitcoin
[29:03] just I guess to retire on it and like to
[29:05] to build a family wealth and
[29:06] generational wealth in in there, which
[29:08] is an interesting mindset of of having,
[29:10] hey, like I have this I have this house
[29:13] and the student depth and I want to pay
[29:16] that down because I hate depth so much.
[29:18] So, I'm uh I'm I'm taking this one risky
[29:21] bet to to to get that done. Uh and then
[29:24] um I'm I'm going onto the path of having
[29:28] Bitcoin in cold storage and doing it how
[29:30] you say like the righteous path. I think
[29:32] that's like that's probably not one
[29:35] thing like as the righteous path, but if
[29:37] if there would be that would probably be
[29:40] be the righteous path. Uh do do you also
[29:42] think about uh the thing beyond that of
[29:46] like hey like I I want to accumulate
[29:48] that many bitcoin and then my my family
[29:50] can kind of rely on that one. Then we
[29:53] also have the house uh which is also
[29:55] interesting owning real estate as a
[29:57] bitcoiner because you just like know how
[30:00] the the comparison between the real
[30:01] estate asset and the and the bitcoin
[30:03] asset is how do you look at uh those
[30:05] things? Yeah, 100%, Robin. And before I
[30:08] before I forget, my ADHD brain takes me
[30:10] away. But on the real estate thing, I
[30:13] tell you what, I'm going to be a little
[30:14] offensive here, I will I wouldn't be
[30:16] offended if the housing market crashed.
[30:18] In fact, I almost wanted to, to be
[30:20] honest with you. I am like I'm going to
[30:23] take a little bit of a I really have
[30:26] I've worked with a lot of young people
[30:28] over the last being a public school
[30:29] teacher even as a chiropractor and it
[30:32] just like kind of pisses me off that
[30:35] young people can't get into a house that
[30:37] they feel like they own. Um, you know,
[30:40] here's the thing. Real estate was was
[30:42] great when it was 50 years ago and
[30:45] people weren't making that much money,
[30:47] but you could take out a 30-year
[30:49] mortgage on your house and it was an
[30:51] asset because at the time that was the
[30:53] Bitcoin of the time and they made their
[30:56] money and that's great. But now it's
[30:58] turned into something where only the
[31:01] elite few can have it. We're wiping out
[31:05] families in America because I can speak
[31:07] fully. And this is if I'm a normal guy,
[31:10] I could feel like I'm a normal guy. I
[31:12] literally have normal IQ. I'm the
[31:14] average. I'm the 95% average. I'm not an
[31:16] outlier. So, that tells me as a family,
[31:19] man, that most people would be happy
[31:21] raising a family in their own house, not
[31:23] having to deal with a landlord, not
[31:25] having to deal with somebody breathing
[31:26] down their neck. There's just something
[31:28] beautiful about just having your own
[31:29] little piece of earth to raise your
[31:31] family on. It's not an investment. I'm
[31:33] not looking to make money on it. I want
[31:35] everyone to have that that that
[31:37] possibility for them. And the truth is
[31:39] is just that's gone. And that's gone
[31:42] because real estate's being treated like
[31:44] an investment or has become an
[31:45] investment where everybody has to rent
[31:47] or you're going to have to deal with
[31:48] these outrageous prices. I could care
[31:51] less, Robin, if I ever make a scent off
[31:53] my house. I could care less. I'm just
[31:55] going to wipe out the debt on the
[31:57] mortgage and then move on from it. I
[31:58] could care less if my house drops to
[32:00] zero. In fact, I hope it does so other
[32:03] people can have a house and have a
[32:04] family because that's the meaning of
[32:06] life, especially for for everybody,
[32:08] young men and young women. So, it breaks
[32:10] my heart that that people can't get into
[32:12] a home. And I hope Bitcoin devours the
[32:16] real estate market. And I'm going to
[32:17] love it when it does. And that's what
[32:20] $300 trillion. Heck yeah. Go Bitcoin.
[32:23] Devour. I love it. Let truth devour it.
[32:26] So, my house is not an investment. And
[32:29] my house is for me and my family to
[32:31] enjoy a piece of land. And I'll be here
[32:32] for I'll be here until somebody walks by
[32:36] and notices a strange smell cuz the old
[32:38] man on the street finally dropped dead.
[32:41] You know what I mean? So, I'm not
[32:43] looking to make any money off my house.
[32:45] In fact, I want everybody to be able to
[32:46] have a house. So, crash the whole thing.
[32:48] Go Bitcoin. Take that $300 trillion or
[32:51] however much it is and let everybody
[32:53] have a freaking home and to raise a
[32:55] family in. There's that. as for
[32:57] long-term. Robin, you know, I aspire to
[33:00] be you, man. I mean, you're my
[33:03] inspiration. I haven't put nearly the
[33:07] time needed into being a genuine actual
[33:10] Bitcoiner. Just putting your Bitcoin in
[33:13] cold storage and walking away from it.
[33:15] What What is that, right? What is that?
[33:18] It's It's a savings account. It's It's a
[33:20] savings account. There's so much more to
[33:23] that. There's so much more to that. I
[33:26] can't I could never just do that because
[33:28] it's just not me. I need more. I need
[33:32] this as a medium of exchange. I need to
[33:34] get paid in Bitcoin. I need this to be
[33:38] my full standard, right? And I'm not
[33:42] there yet. I haven't even touched that
[33:43] yet. That'll be a conversation for the
[33:46] future, God willing, with you. I would
[33:48] love that. I'm not there yet. I still
[33:50] got to take care of this. I still still
[33:52] playing the stupid fiat game. But when
[33:55] I'm done with that long term is to be a
[33:57] Bitcoiner. A real Bitcoiner. Not not a
[33:59] normie, not some like I am right
[34:02] now. I aspire to be a real Bitcoiner.
[34:05] And my kids will know Bitcoin.
[34:07] Absolutely. And I'm actually happy that
[34:08] I have kids because they're smart
[34:10] because kids and young people are so
[34:12] freaking intelligent. My children will
[34:14] blow me out of the water on Bitcoin
[34:17] because as soon as they're able to
[34:19] comprehend more, they're just little
[34:20] right now, but as soon as they're able
[34:22] to actually comprehend what this is, I
[34:25] know that they're going to be my
[34:26] teacher. So, that's really what I'm
[34:29] looking to do is be more like you, be
[34:32] more like uh true Bitcoiners out there
[34:35] where this is the new standard. And I'm
[34:37] far from it, but that's the idea. And I
[34:39] already know just my heart just tells me
[34:41] that that I don't need to worry about a
[34:44] world like that because I know it's as
[34:46] close to truth as pos it'll be as close
[34:48] to righteousness and truth as it is
[34:50] under that world.
 I didn't look it up
[34:52] before. I I should have should have let
[34:55] let AI run through our last transcript.
[34:57] But uh I remember some David and Golad
[35:00] story with like new Bitcoiners and and
[35:02] and OG Bitcoiners if do do I remember
[35:05] that correctly? This was of you right?
[35:08] Yes. Yes, good call. Yeah, that was my
[35:10] uh gosh, I was, you know, reading
[35:12] through the Old Testament when I first
[35:13] got into Bitcoin. So, like my brain was
[35:15] like making all these connections. Yeah,
[35:17] I love that one. That's a good one,
[35:19] Robin. Some people got really offended.
[35:20] I actually made a video on that. Some
[35:22] people lit me up on it and they had good
[35:24] points. They had good points. You know,
[35:25] when you start mixing religion with
[35:27] Bitcoin, it can get offensive. So, I was
[35:29] totally I actually it kind of humbled
[35:31] me. But to strip it down objectively for
[35:34] sure. I was using the comparison how uh
[35:36] how David basically it's both sides
[35:39] right because Goliath's armor was
[35:41] actually the money of the time. His
[35:43] armor was shekels which was either
[35:46] bronze or silver one or the other. But
[35:48] it kind of gave you a peak into history
[35:50] how he was known as such a great warrior
[35:52] because the more battles he survived the
[35:55] more money he gained and he would just
[35:58] melt it down and add onto his armor. I
[36:01] was the analogy there thinking if you
[36:03] want to be Goliath, you get into
[36:05] Bitcoin. I'm I'm less than two years,
[36:08] Robin. And I went from a broky
[36:12] to now I'm watching my net worth. I'm
[36:14] playing I got to be careful because I
[36:16] don't want somebody coming here knocking
[36:17] me over the head and, you know, thinking
[36:19] that I'm some there's far more richer
[36:21] people than me, thank God. But I went
[36:23] from being a broky to now like I'm
[36:24] playing with six figures
[36:27] constantly. I'm watching my I'm watching
[36:29] my net worth drop more drop more than
[36:33] like my yearly wages from being a
[36:36] Bitcoiner for two years. You go from
[36:37] being a broke nothing on the battlefield
[36:40] to the longer you're a Bitcoiner, you
[36:41] become a Goliath because it just like
[36:43] you said at the very beginning, it
[36:45] generates wealth and the longer you
[36:47] survive in it and learn from it, you
[36:50] become a Goliath. Your armor just gets
[36:51] so head to toe, right? That was my
[36:54] analogy with Goliath is that Goliath had
[36:57] to start somewhere. He didn't just have
[36:59] the armor right off the bat. I mean, the
[37:00] dude was an old seven foot warrior that
[37:03] had been through so many cycles. His
[37:04] armor was a freaking inch thick. There
[37:06] you go. Comic Bitcoiner, go the
[37:09] longevity and you're going to accumulate
[37:11] that wealth. And then on the David
[37:13] analogy was really just you have to be
[37:16] able to uh you know, David's whole thing
[37:17] was everybody scrutinized him and
[37:20] doubted him and he was a nobody and he
[37:21] came from nothing. you wouldn't even
[37:23] know his father's name. And he was
[37:25] living in a time where everyone was
[37:26] fearful and no one wanted to go out and
[37:30] removing Goliath as the Bitcoin analogy,
[37:32] but just looking at Goliath maybe as
[37:34] like the the fiat system or for me maybe
[37:37] it's my debt, right? David was willing
[37:40] to go out there and literally die with
[37:43] conviction. He's the story of
[37:45] conviction. And then because of his
[37:47] conviction, he ends up becoming like the
[37:50] greatest king of all time. So the two
[37:53] characters uh I love both characters in
[37:55] the story and if it's an analogy to a
[37:57] Bitcoiner, you know, it's that with
[37:59] conviction and with patience and time in
[38:03] Bitcoin, you will accumulate wealth and
[38:05] you'll accumulate status. Because before
[38:08] all this, Robin, you know what was the
[38:09] worst about being broke? Cuz I'm not a
[38:11] materialistic guy. Not because I'm not
[38:13] because I'm righteous, but just because
[38:15] ever since I was a kid, I I like having
[38:17] nothing. Things stress me out. But what
[38:20] killed me, I actually I I really I'm
[38:23] very selfish in that I love to be
[38:25] generous because I get 10 times more. If
[38:27] I give somebody something and they get
[38:29] excited, whatever they're feeling, I'm
[38:31] on cloud like nine, 10. So I'm very
[38:34] selfish in that I like to give because
[38:35] I'm like, "Oh yeah, now let me see how
[38:37] excited you are." I couldn't do any of
[38:39] that until I became a Bitcoiner. Now,
[38:42] dude, my wallet is freaking this fat
[38:45] with fiat. Everywhere I go, somebody
[38:48] begs me for fiat. I literally whip out.
[38:50] I'm like, "Dude, here. Make it rain."
[38:53] Someone, "Hey, man. I have this
[38:54] organization. You know, I'm looking
[38:56] after dogs. You got any?" Like, "Dude,
[38:57] here. Hey, you know, my wife needs
[39:00] something. My kids need something.
[39:01] Christmas comes around." Like, I'm just
[39:03] loving all the generosity that I get to
[39:05] give because of it. So, it just makes
[39:08] your life better. And there you go. You
[39:10] know, David was a generous man, and I'm
[39:11] sure Goliath was, too. But when you're
[39:14] broke and you have nothing, you're just
[39:15] nothing. And if you want to change that,
[39:17] get into Bitcoin.
[39:19] You're looking at a guy a year and a
[39:20] half, Robin. A broke nothing to a guy
[39:23] who gets to be generous and have money.
[39:25] And people are looking at me and my
[39:27] students in school are going, "Man, Mr.
[39:28] Kenny, I want to be like you. You're
[39:29] wealthy." I'm like, "Whoa, what? It's
[39:33] cool. That's amazing." All thanks to
[39:35] Bitcoin. It's incredible. Robin,
[39:39] I I I I truly think if you give without
[39:44] asking or expecting in return that you
[39:47] will get more back than you actually
[39:52] gave.
[39:53] There there's some unwritten rule I
[39:56] think somewhere in the universe where
[39:59] this is true and you you might not see
[40:04] how you got it back or how you get it
[40:05] back but you definitely do. Uh it's it's
[40:09] every time I opt for love and generosity
[40:14] things get better. Things just magically
[40:17] work out in a in a in a better way. and
[40:20] and I'm very non-spiritual.
[40:23] I'm very not I'm not even religious. I'm
[40:25] I'm I'm not at all those things. But
[40:28] there's some weirdness with human beings
[40:32] that if you see someone that gives just
[40:36] without any expectations like if you if
[40:39] you give something and you have even the
[40:40] smallest expectation to give something
[40:42] back, you did not really give anything.
[40:45] You you you just gave him an obligation
[40:47] to give you something back. That's
[40:48] that's like like truly giving something
[40:51] just because you think he might benefit
[40:55] from that without any expectation back.
[40:57] I think this is really like it it's it's
[41:01] probably even like a good move to do.
[41:04] But if you do it as a move, then you're
[41:06] also not doing it just out of out of
[41:08] givingness. So like that that's it's
[41:10] really hard to give without without
[41:13] expectations. I I just want to throw
[41:15] that out because I also never said that
[41:16] on the podcast, but it's it's very true.
[41:18] It's was true in my my short little
[41:21] life, this 26 years I'm on Earth, but
[41:24] it's generosity, like actually giving
[41:27] it it lights people up. It's it's it's
[41:30] something really good and people really
[41:32] notice if you mean it or not. Like if if
[41:35] you just give it to give or if you give
[41:37] it to receive something that that
[41:40] there's a huge difference there.
 Yeah,
[41:41] 100%. Robin, I mean, we're talking
[41:43] because of I received that from you. I
[41:45] was a commenter on a video of yours,
[41:49] right? Have me on your show, man. I just
[41:51] was like watching your videos. I just
[41:53] liked you cuz you're this young guy. You
[41:55] were like, "Cool." I'm like, "Dude, let
[41:57] me go on the show." And I straight
[41:59] commented you and what did you do? You
[42:01] gave. And you gave. And now look at us,
[42:04] you know, two years later. So, you do
[42:05] live that. It's I love it, man. cuz I
[42:08] love uh you know when I when I read the
[42:10] Bible, I read it non-religiously. I was
[42:12] determined to read it non-religiously
[42:13] and just objective. And it's interesting
[42:15] cuz I'm actually on the book of Matthew
[42:17] right now. And uh just reading like the
[42:20] story of Jesus just again I always try
[42:22] to put my mind in a non-religious
[42:24] mindset because I do better with my
[42:26] mental construct does better
[42:28] religiously. when I get away from it,
[42:31] I'm actually I realize a very degenerate
[42:33] type of person where I can be like pure
[42:36] evil and I almost need to con I need to
[42:39] construct the religious mindset to keep
[42:42] me like I need that no be good, be
[42:45] righteous. I need that slap. There are
[42:48] people,
[42:49] some of the best people I know are
[42:51] basically you. They're like uh
[42:53] non-religious I call them you're you're
[42:55] not religious but you're you're already
[42:57] God's person. I've met so many people
[42:59] like you. It's interesting, you know,
[43:00] one of my my best friends in
[43:01] chiropractic school, just like you,
[43:03] non-religious. My own wife,
[43:04] non-religious.
[43:06] Um, and they're just the best people.
[43:07] But what I realize is I'm like, you're
[43:09] not religious because you're already
[43:10] just naturally like God already speaks
[43:13] through you in a weird way. Uh, whereas
[43:15] me, and if you look at all of Jesus's
[43:18] disciples, they're the worst of the
[43:19] worst. They're all murderers and rapists
[43:22] and kill. They're the terrible people.
[43:24] They're the religious people. They're
[43:25] me. That's me. I'm a religious person. I
[43:27] need it cuz otherwise I'm a terrible
[43:29] person. But before I get too off track,
[43:32] Jesus goes up on this mountain in the
[43:35] book of Matthew. It's it's a beautiful
[43:37] dude. He goes up on this mountain and
[43:39] literally lays out like three or four
[43:41] things that are just solid. And one of
[43:42] them is everything you just said, Robin,
[43:45] that you came to without probably ever
[43:47] reading the book of Matthew. When it
[43:49] came to giving, Jesus said that exact
[43:52] same thing. He said, "Give and don't let
[43:55] anybody see it." That's how he said it.
[43:56] Don't let anybody see you give. Just
[43:59] give and don't expect anything in
[44:01] return. Give and don't take anything in
[44:03] return. Don't let And if no one sees it,
[44:06] you're blessed. That's the thing. And I
[44:08] think you made such a good point cuz
[44:10] when you give, and I there's plenty of
[44:12] times you give and then no one sees it.
[44:16] And you might think to yourself, your
[44:17] animal instinct, right? Because I think
[44:19] humans have two brains. You have the
[44:20] animal brain and you have the God brain.
[44:22] The god brain is like the self-conscious
[44:23] brain. Just the regular conscious brain
[44:25] that regulates all your drives is your
[44:27] animal brain. Your animal brain always
[44:30] wants that reward system. I gave now I
[44:33] return, right? And plus, give me more.
[44:36] Plus, need survival, need food, need
[44:38] water, need shelter. Man, when you give
[44:42] and no one sees whether and if it
[44:45] happens by you didn't want it to happen,
[44:47] you gave and you just didn't get any
[44:48] recognition even when you wanted it. I'm
[44:51] learning to take a step and and embrace
[44:53] your mindset right there and realize you
[44:55] just received a blessing. And make no
[44:58] mistake, it's coming back. It might not
[45:00] be tomorrow, might not be in this
[45:02] lifetime, but it's coming back. So,
[45:04] anytime you give, and I'm practicing
[45:06] what you just said. I'm in the process
[45:08] of practicing that. It's hard, like you
[45:10] said. It's so hard not to have
[45:11] expectations when you give, right? When
[45:14] you put the tip in, but you wait for the
[45:16] person to come back so they can see it.
[45:18] That's been my thing. I've been
[45:19] practicing. If I go somewhere and like
[45:21] the little tip, it's like when they walk
[45:23] away, I'm going to put it in. And then
[45:26] so I have to and then Oh man, when I do
[45:28] that, I literally my gut hurts because
[45:30] I'm like, "Oh, I wanted them to see it."
[45:34] If they don't see it, if you give and
[45:36] they don't see it, man, listen to Robin,
[45:38] man. That bless you just got blessed.
[45:40] It's way better than when you get that
[45:43] little recognition. Oh, they saw it. Oh,
[45:45] thank you. I gave you 10 bucks. The
[45:47] bigger blessing is when they turn their
[45:49] back, you put it in, and they never saw
[45:50] it. You got 10. That's a 10x blessing
[45:53] right there, for sure. 100%.
[45:56] I I want to show you something. It It's
[45:58] It's It's so freaking funny. I think you
[46:00] you you might like it. I I I will see if
[46:04] there is
[46:06] Do I find that thing?
[46:09] Otherwise, I will just describe it. I I
[46:12] don't find it. Basically, it was an an
[46:14] an a scene in Seinfeld. And I I I'm a
[46:18] big Seinfeld fan. Like, it's a very old
[46:20] series. I think I don't know if if if a
[46:23] lot of people even know it, but it's
[46:25] it's an old series, and I I love it.
[46:26] It's it's it it was it was there before
[46:29] I was born,
[46:31] but I discovered it and I'm absolutely
[46:33] in love with that that series, Seinfeld.
[46:35] And there's this episode where George um
[46:39] uh wants to tip the guy from the Gatsole
[46:42] uh where he gets a Gatsole and uh he
[46:46] he's kind of waiting for him to see it
[46:49] and and then he dropped it in and he
[46:52] almost saw it but like he looked away
[46:54] and then he went away and then George
[46:56] was like, "Oh like I I want him to
[46:58] see." So he grabbed it out again and
[47:01] then the guy saw him grabbing the money
[47:03] out of the dip dipch. It's an hilarious
[47:07] scene. Uh but that's how humans actually
[47:10] work. Like they they really want to have
[47:13] as desperately as possible this like oh
[47:15] like see here I'm a good guy. I I tipped
[47:20] you. You should see that. You should say
[47:22] thank you. You should be grateful for
[47:24] that. It's like no. Like if you really
[47:28] want to tip him, tip him when he's not
[47:30] looking, he's looking away, then you
[47:32] should put it in tip jar. But that's not
[47:34] how a human works. Like that's how and
[47:35] it's it's it's not a lot. Like if you I
[47:38] don't know like what what putting you
[47:39] what would you put in there? Like you
[47:41] buy good uh like a pizza for $10, you
[47:43] might put in like $5. That's that's
[47:45] already a lot. Uh like two two euros or
[47:48] whatever your currency is. Uh, so it's
[47:52] all about like almost nothing in in in
[47:55] the bigger relation to it, but it's the
[47:58] intent of how you do it. And it's
[48:00] probably hard to to actually do it
[48:02] without him looking because like
[48:05] most in the restaurants, for example,
[48:07] you basically have to tell him what the
[48:09] tip is. So, it's not even possible to
[48:11] tip without it. Uh, but it's just an
[48:14] interesting uh small episode. The
[48:16] episode name I just saw the COA and the
[48:19] the bottle deposit I think is the is the
[48:21] name if someone wants to look it up. So
[48:23] it's it's a it's a really it's a really
[48:24] fun one.
 Seinfeld's a masterpiece.
[48:27] Robin, I'm so happy that someone still
[48:29] watches. I love that that show is still
[48:31] surviving into the younger generation.
[48:33] That's great, man. Oh, I grew up on
[48:35] Seinfeld. I I love it. I've seen that
[48:37] scene. Oh, magnificent show. But it's
[48:40] such a good point, right? I mean, they
[48:41] hit up on all those like social norms.
[48:43] They really, it was a comedy that pushed
[48:45] kind of the narrative and made you
[48:46] question things. And that's one of them,
[48:48] right? Like George Castanza, the
[48:50] character, was very animallike. He was
[48:52] very visceral. He was all about those
[48:54] feedback loops, right? If and and it
[48:57] just makes sense for for his type of
[48:59] character that he was the guy. He always
[49:00] wanted something back, right? George was
[49:02] a an opportunist. He always needed if he
[49:05] gave, he needed it right back. And even
[49:07] then some. So perfect. And and look at
[49:10] his character, right? He lived kind of a
[49:11] terrible life. his character, the way he
[49:15] was by demonstration of how he behaved
[49:18] with the tip, that was his whole
[49:19] character. And the man had a pretty
[49:22] terrible life and pretty bad fortune for
[49:25] the most part.
 I I found it. I I will
[49:28] quickly put it on put it up on screen. I
[49:31] I just would love for people to to to
[49:34] see that. It's it's it's so far outside
[49:36] of the topic,
[49:38] but uh we we we should explore that
[49:41] quickly together.
[49:44] Let me
[49:46] share my screen. Tap.
[49:50] Bam. The first time I ever made any
[49:52] money, I got myself from that money a
[49:54] watch. And ever since then, I collect
[49:57] time pieces to remember times where I
[50:00] achieved some milestone. That's why I
[50:02] got the Bitcoin 2025 edition when I went
[50:05] to my first ever American Bitcoin
[50:08] conference. So for me, the Bitcoin
[50:10] watches from Coin Vichilan represents
[50:12] the time that we are living in. For
[50:14] every person that wears a Bitcoin watch,
[50:17] I know they are representing sound money
[50:21] to the outside world. Make sure to check
[50:23] out those amazing Coin Vigilante time
[50:26] pieces down in the descriptions. I love
[50:29] those watches so much. The most
[50:32] important thing for your Bitcoin journey
[50:34] is not buying Bitcoin, but it's how to
[50:37] keep them. And yes, you have maybe the
[50:39] right tools, but how do you actually go
[50:41] ahead and stick it all together so it's
[50:44] the most secure for you personally?
[50:47] Self-custody is a deeply personalized
[50:49] journey. And the Bitcoin way is helping
[50:52] you exactly finding that correct setup
[50:55] for you personally. They're also helping
[50:57] you with securing your own cyber
[51:00] security. And if you want to go one step
[51:03] above all that, you can even get a
[51:05] consultation for a plan B residency. Go
[51:09] to the bitcoinway.com/roin
[51:13] and you will get a 30inut free
[51:16] consultation. I know how big of a hurdle
[51:19] it can be to have self-custody, but it's
[51:22] so freaking important to make that first
[51:24] step. We have to make sure it's as easy
[51:27] and simple as possible. And that's
[51:30] exactly what Bitbox did. Bitbox created
[51:33] the simplest and the easiest hardware
[51:36] wallet to use to get into self custody.
[51:39] So get yourself a Bitbox down from the
[51:42] link in the description. And when you
[51:44] use code Robin, you even get a 5%
[51:47] discount. We have that scene. Let's just
[51:51] listen. See the the Yeah, I think it's
[51:55] it is here. You see it?
 Robin.
[52:00] You know, uh, my last name is Castanza.
[52:03] That's Italian. So, uh, you and I are
[52:05] kind of like countrymen.
[52:08] Seems good. You change.
 Ah, yes. And I
[52:10] always take care of my paisano. So,
[52:13] here's a little something.
[52:20] Hey. Hey. You steal my money?
 No. No.
[52:23] No. You don't understand. I wasn't
[52:24] trying to take it out.
 I know what you
[52:25] tried to do. Now, get out of there.
[52:27] Don't come back here again.
[52:29] High pressure.
[52:33] Perfect.
 Perfect.
[52:36] Perfect.
[52:38] Brilliant. Robin, dude, you're sharp,
[52:41] man. That's cool that you made that.
[52:42] Isn't the brain amazing how fast it can
[52:45] like retrieve a memory or a previous and
[52:47] make those connections so fast. That's
[52:49] cool, dude. And you're young, too. Your
[52:51] mind's strong.
 I I've watched it too
[52:53] many times. I feel like that's I think
[52:55] you got some repetition.
[52:57] That's beautiful. That's perfect.
 But I
[53:00] want
 I want to take it back to religion
[53:03] and and and and Bitcoin. Um it's
[53:08] do you think that Bitcoin has some some
[53:10] religious aspects like that Bitcoin
[53:12] itself is is kind of almost a religion.
[53:16] Um and I make let's see like what are
[53:18] the the kind of characteristics that I
[53:20] see. We have in many different uh cities
[53:24] in Europe now statues of Satoshi's. We
[53:27] have a very strong community that really
[53:29] holds together and has like this common
[53:31] belief even though they come from very
[53:33] different backgrounds uh and very
[53:35] different beliefs otherwise but like
[53:37] there's one set that they really believe
[53:39] in with the strong money and the
[53:41] sovereignty. Uh we have uh Bitcoin
[53:44] celebrations let's call it Bitcoin
[53:47] Bitcoin Vegas like all those uh uh get
[53:50] togethers where we kind of come together
[53:52] and and celebrate Bitcoin together. We
[53:55] even have like smaller monthly meetups
[53:58] and and and always depending on where
[54:00] you are like this weekly meetups where
[54:02] we read the the gospel of Bitcoin to
[54:05] each other kind of. We have we have we
[54:08] don't have a Bible but we have many
[54:10] different Bitcoin books and you could
[54:12] put that together and and read from the
[54:14] Michael Sailor like you read from the
[54:18] like the the Matthew uh Luziaak the fiat
[54:21] food and like there's many different you
[54:24] could put a a Bitcoin Bible together in
[54:26] in like one big one and like make I
[54:28] don't know like a 2000 site page where
[54:31] where you have all the all the uh
[54:34] Bitcoin articles in there. So when you
[54:37] look at all those things, do do you feel
[54:40] like Bitcoin might actually be
[54:43] way because it's so fundamental to our
[54:45] lives even like more than just money or
[54:47] is are we just in like crazy crazy phase
[54:50] right now?
 No, you're not crazy face,
[54:53] Robin. And honestly, as you describe it,
[54:54] right, you see the joy it brings out in
[54:56] your face as you talk about these
[54:58] meetings, as these readings, this
[55:00] community, right? Like really what at
[55:03] its fundamental is religion? And in my
[55:05] opinion and this is just based on like
[55:08] most of my experience being with like a
[55:11] Christian religion is uh like you have
[55:13] basically three things. One you have a
[55:15] miracle a very scarce miracle right like
[55:18] the reason Christians are like myself
[55:20] are so intensely religiously for Christ
[55:24] is because there's that miracle a man
[55:26] who died and was resurrected. It's a
[55:29] miracle. Bitcoin's a miracle. Literally
[55:32] just comes out of nowhere. the guy that
[55:34] invents it or the people or the gal are
[55:37] gone, right? And it's achieved absolute
[55:40] scarcity. It was during one of your
[55:43] guests that they described absolute
[55:45] scarcity so well. One of your guests did
[55:48] that I actually like comprehended it for
[55:50] a second and the actual intensity of it.
[55:53] And I like literally spent the rest of
[55:54] the day like fervently just going like
[55:56] oh my god like okay I know the big bang
[56:00] and I know the universe has been around
[56:01] like 10 bill like I'm living in a time
[56:05] where a human or somebody something
[56:08] created absolute scarcity what so
[56:12] there's the miracle just like a religion
[56:14] any religion that people get worship for
[56:16] you have the miracle right so you have
[56:19] that part of bitcoin you have the
[56:20] miracle so it makes sense that people
[56:22] would be drawn to it religiously. You
[56:25] have the salvation as a Christian,
[56:28] right? You get the salvation of your
[56:29] soul because you have a man who died for
[56:32] you. So now you could go and live in
[56:33] mercy and kindness and happiness and you
[56:36] know that's been a a weight lifted off
[56:38] your shoulders.
[56:40] Bitcoin has brought salvation to every
[56:43] person financially that has gotten
[56:46] involved in it. I have watched
[56:50] every episode of yours for at least the
[56:53] last year and a half at some point. I
[56:55] binge it and then I go and do other
[56:56] stuff for a while and then I binge it.
[56:58] I've never heard someone come on your
[57:00] show and not tell a story of salvation.
[57:03] I've never heard somebody come on here
[57:05] and diss on Bitcoin and talk about how
[57:07] they lost everything unless they're like
[57:09] me and stupid and leveraging and doing
[57:11] all that dumb stuff. But even then,
[57:12] we're making money. Even us, even us
[57:15] stupid leveragers are making ridiculous
[57:17] money. It's stupid. But there there's
[57:19] salvation. So people find salvation in
[57:21] Bitcoin, right? So you have the miracle,
[57:23] you have the salvation, and then most
[57:25] importantly, you have the community. As
[57:28] you were talking about your meetings,
[57:29] Robin, you guys reading the the white
[57:31] pages, that's the ones I know, maybe the
[57:33] books, right? There's some humor in
[57:35] there. There's some light-hearted humor
[57:37] of like a Satoshi Nakamoto and the
[57:40] statues.
[57:41] It's community. It brings people
[57:43] together where there's love and there's
[57:45] kindness. There's nothing there's no
[57:47] better feeling. I've I weep, Robin, when
[57:50] I go. And I'm down to go. I've been I've
[57:53] been to Islamic services. I I'm a
[57:56] seeker. I'm happy to go to any service,
[57:59] any church service. I just grew up
[58:01] Catholic, so I I gravitate back to where
[58:03] I'm comfortable. But when I'm in church
[58:06] and I'm around a community of people,
[58:08] especially during like the singing and
[58:10] the worshiping and everything that you
[58:12] just described that you do with your
[58:13] Bitcoiners, I can't help sometimes a
[58:17] tear
[58:19] just falls. The tears just fall and
[58:22] they're joyous tears cuz the feeling of
[58:26] uh community is so powerful that it can
[58:30] evoke such a religious feeling out of
[58:33] you. the tears fall from your eyes. I
[58:34] wouldn't be surprised if somebody didn't
[58:37] have just joyous tears falling from
[58:39] their eyes at a Bitcoin meeting. Just
[58:41] taking a step and just being like, "Wow,
[58:43] I'm around a group of people. We all
[58:45] love each other. We're all coming
[58:47] together around this miracle.
[58:50] We're not tearing each other's throats
[58:52] out. We're not dissing on each other for
[58:54] our skin color or culture. Like, we're
[58:57] here to love each other."
[58:59] Bitcoin absolutely has a lot of
[59:02] religious qualities to it and the hope
[59:06] is like with even the religion of
[59:10] tradition is that it brings out the and
[59:13] you know it has a lot of religious
[59:14] qualities too Robin and in that it's
[59:15] violent man like I uh I'm on X and dude
[59:20] Bitcoin's violent on X I mean there's a
[59:23] it's a violent it's it's a there's a
[59:25] violent sect right religions have sex
[59:27] like s ect ccts sex of religion for
[59:32] every beautiful group of of Robin s
[59:35] groups that are like kumbaya in it and
[59:38] just bitcoining out and getting that
[59:40] that beautiful religious feeling of it
[59:42] dude there's some dark dark sex of
[59:44] bitcoin too where I mean you just see
[59:47] the hate and the anger coming out uh so
[59:50] it evokes powerful emotions like it does
[59:52] religion so there's a lot of ties on
[59:55] both ends because at the same time where
[59:57] people can come together and love one
[59:58] another over religion. Dude, people will
[60:00] literally do the most horrible things to
[60:02] people over religion. And anybody who's
[60:04] read history, I mean, my god, I just
[60:06] finished a book about the crusades. I
[60:08] like could only read a few a few pages
[60:11] sometimes for what these people were
[60:12] doing to each other over their their
[60:14] religion. And you know, for how powerful
[60:17] Bitcoin is, I wouldn't be surprised if
[60:20] somehow the more violent sex don't start
[60:22] ripping people's guts out over it.
[60:24] Humans are violent. We're prime apes. or
[60:26] advanced prime apes. We like war. We
[60:29] like we like to kill. And so Bitcoin can
[60:32] bring that out too.
[60:35] Bitcoin can bring that out too.
 Yeah.
[60:38] The only the only thing that I want to
[60:41] say uh in addition to that, I've met
[60:45] people that I've seen previously only on
[60:48] Twitter
[60:50] and I thought they're extremely
[60:53] aggressive, but then they are so
[60:56] freaking kind and nice in person. So I I
[61:00] I I I feel like sometimes Twitter brings
[61:04] out a a lot of uh emotions in us, but we
[61:10] definitely are extremely
[61:13] um passionate about our Bitcoin and you
[61:17] should not speak ill of my Bitcoin, you
[61:19] know, like there's this like you don't
[61:21] speak ill of my Bitcoin because I love
[61:23] it so much and if you if you say
[61:26] something bad about Bitcoin, I take it
[61:28] personally And to some extent we even
[61:32] need that because Bitcoin is so early
[61:34] on. We need those like really passionate
[61:36] about Bitcoiners. Uh I'm I'm not one of
[61:39] them. I'm really passionate about it.
[61:41] Obviously I'm talking every day about
[61:43] Bitcoin. Um but if someone talks about
[61:46] bad about Bitcoin, I just recognize that
[61:49] and uh if I have a good day, I I give
[61:52] him some uh some some additions to like
[61:54] why he might be wrong or like uh why I
[61:57] see differently. If if if I have a bad
[61:59] day, just ignore it.
 Good call, Robin.
[62:02] Turn the other cheek, right? You know,
[62:04] let the uh let the enemy slap you in the
[62:06] face and just say thank you. Thank you.
[62:09] Right.
 I think it's something bad to do.
[62:11] Like if if someone says something really
[62:13] bad about Bitcoin and you are just
[62:15] agreeing to that like, oh, okay. Yeah.
[62:17] Uh and you're not correcting him, you
[62:20] doing him a disservice because he gets
[62:25] Bitcoin later on only. So you make him
[62:29] buy Bitcoin at a higher price basically
[62:32] because he will have to buy Bitcoin or
[62:34] adopt Bitcoin at some point. I'm I'm
[62:36] fairly certain about that. So if he
[62:39] doesn't do that, if if he has if he
[62:42] comes along and say like, "Oh, Bitcoin
[62:44] is so bad for the environment." And you
[62:46] are not challenging that at all, you're
[62:48] doing him a disservice. So that's why I
[62:51] said like if I'm not challenging him, I
[62:54] do have a bad day because I'm not ready
[62:56] to like look give with love. So I I I
[63:00] rather don't give at all because I don't
[63:02] want to give with hate. So, uh, I I I do
[63:06] see it's it's to to some degree as a
[63:09] responsibility as a Bitcoiner
[63:13] to bring context and facts and nuances
[63:18] to the table when there is lines
[63:21] dropping like, oh, Bitcoin will not
[63:23] scale, Bitcoin is bad for the
[63:25] environment, Bitcoin is too volatile,
[63:27] like all those things that we can talk
[63:30] at length why they are not good, but
[63:33] those the things that are kind of really
[63:36] happening. Uh like those are the
[63:38] mainstream narratives that a lot of
[63:40] people still have to this day. Even
[63:42] though if you really look a little bit
[63:44] deeper, you'll see like oh like it's not
[63:46] like that. But yeah, we we we don't want
[63:49] someone to speak ill about our Bitcoin,
[63:52] I guess.
 Yeah. You're And you know what,
[63:54] Robin? Just like 100%, man. And and just
[63:57] like I love I love now that we're on
[63:59] still the religion. Religion has what?
[64:01] Has missionaries, right? I mean you've
[64:03] never and missionaries with that are
[64:05] quite literally willing to die for their
[64:08] beliefs. That's also another fa factor
[64:10] of a religion. You get these
[64:12] missionaries that are like man they are
[64:14] willing to go down. I mean you had the
[64:15] early in many ways there's a lot of
[64:17] analogies cuz if you were an early
[64:19] Christian missionary you were quite
[64:21] literally in a way offended if somebody
[64:24] wasn't trying to understand your message
[64:26] because just like you're trying to save
[64:28] somebody's financial well-being. Like,
[64:31] dude, if you don't get this, you're
[64:33] screwed. Like, you don't you you realize
[64:35] this is the direction we're moving in.
[64:37] And if you're not getting it right here,
[64:38] right now, you're damned. You are
[64:40] literally damned. Like, I'm trying to do
[64:42] you a favor by you understanding this.
[64:45] You're a missionary trying to save
[64:46] people's financial souls there or or
[64:49] their future their future well-being
[64:52] through your your Bitcoin missionary.
[64:55] It's the same with the early Christians,
[64:57] right? I mean, they had such strong
[64:59] conviction. And they were literally
[65:00] like, I will get eaten by lions and
[65:02] coliseums
[65:03] before I don't back up this message. And
[65:07] I am offended if you talk about my Lord
[65:10] this way because I need your soul to be
[65:12] saved. I mean, that was just their
[65:13] mentality. They had that that that
[65:16] intense conviction of they do take it
[65:18] personal. They do take it serious. If uh
[65:22] hey, you know, you diss on Bitcoin
[65:23] around Robin Sarah, man, he's going to
[65:26] you're going to strike a chord. The
[65:27] guy's a missionary. He's convicted and
[65:29] again it's because he's trying to save
[65:31] you. So yeah, it's a it's an interesting
[65:34] conversation, Robin. And and and it can
[65:38] it it can offend some people and at the
[65:41] same time uh me personally, I I think
[65:44] it's cool. I I love it. I think uh it's
[65:47] just another part of being a human being
[65:49] and it's it's a bigger more adds on to
[65:51] the human experience and I'm certainly
[65:54] uh all in on the Bitcoin whether it's
[65:57] I'm doing my strategy right now. It's
[65:59] not as it's not as pure. It's not as
[66:01] again not as righteous but I'm all in,
[66:04] man. And I appreciate that. I kind of
[66:06] like what you were just saying. You're
[66:08] uh really trying to drive home the
[66:10] message because you're trying to save
[66:11] people. I'm really grateful that I just
[66:12] typically happen to be an open-minded
[66:14] person. But, you know, I remember I did
[66:16] see you with Robin or you with uh
[66:19] Michael Sailor. That was a big a big
[66:22] episode for me. That was like one of the
[66:24] first times I really started
[66:25] understanding uh that this was something
[66:28] that I really needed to get into and
[66:30] that was kind of a moment of of
[66:32] salvation. So,
[66:34] well, you're a missionary, Robin. You're
[66:37] a you're a Bitcoin missionary. you're
[66:39] willing, would you dive for it?
[66:42] Would you die for Bitcoin?
[66:45] That's an interesting question. It
[66:47] depends on like on on the situation, I
[66:49] guess, because it's like I I'm I'm
[66:52] willing to die financially for it. Like
[66:54] like there's this moment when Bitcoin
[66:57] went from 69K to what was it 16 or 15K,
[67:02] something like that. I was totally ready
[67:05] to ride it to zero. I was like, I'm I'm
[67:07] in it. Like I if it if it goes to zero,
[67:10] I'm in it for I'm I'm happy that that
[67:14] I've uh I've learned so much from
[67:16] Bitcoin, if if all my wealth that I have
[67:19] now in there goes to zero and this is
[67:22] the financial energy that I had to pay
[67:25] for those lessons to be in Bitcoin, then
[67:28] be it.
 So I don't know if I'm willing to
[67:31] die for Bitcoin physically.
[67:34] I I don't know what situation would
[67:37] force me to to in such a thing like oh
[67:39] like if Robin Robin you have to
[67:42] sacrifice yourself otherwise Bitcoin
[67:43] will fail like I don't know how how this
[67:46] will look but I'm willing to die
[67:47] financially for it. I'm not selling my
[67:49] Bitcoin. I I live on a Bitcoin standard
[67:52] and I I am 100% certain that there will
[67:56] be drawbacks. there will be 50% 60%
[67:59] maybe even like 80% drawbacks in a
[68:02] matter of months half years whatever B
[68:05] bit Bitcoin would will test you and
[68:07] Bitcoin will see uh where where uh are
[68:11] you in your conviction story because a
[68:12] lot of people sold at 20K 18K 16K you're
[68:17] like okay Bitcoin is done it went down
[68:19] from 70K to 20K it's over I get out and
[68:23] then they look back at the price one
[68:25] year later and they're like oh It's
[68:27] 112K.
[68:28] I should have stickked with it. I should
[68:30] have doubled down, not sold. Uh, and
[68:33] it's all about the conviction. Those
[68:34] people who are patient enough, th those
[68:36] people who are long in there and have
[68:39] the conviction, those who are the ones
[68:41] to benefit. And those who who sell uh
[68:45] and and just go out completely out of
[68:46] Bitcoin, those will uh will be punished
[68:49] long term. Not like you you you you did
[68:53] not sell Bitcoin. you kind of opted in
[68:55] for a double leverage play. So you
[68:57] doubled down on your your conviction
[68:59] that I I you you called it in the
[69:01] beginning selling Bitcoin, but I I
[69:03] wouldn't call it selling Bitcoin. You
[69:05] just opted in for a different product
[69:07] around Bitcoin. Um so it's it's an
[69:10] interesting interesting way to look at
[69:11] it. But you said uh something I think
[69:14] before we started recording, you said
[69:17] that Bitcoin let you to start new
[69:19] things. Um what what was that?
[69:22] Yeah, thank you Robin. And I appreciate
[69:24] that. And again, thank you for uh being
[69:26] so gracious with with my Bitcoin play.
[69:28] Again, I needed I needed this, man. I
[69:30] knew you I knew you'd make me feel
[69:32] better.
[69:33] I tell you what, so I've been I've been
[69:35] teaching public school the last three
[69:37] years, and I loved it. I really did. I
[69:40] taught science. Um I got to be around
[69:42] young people. Love being around these
[69:44] these young students just exploding with
[69:46] creativity. Um but I've been an employee
[69:50] for 22 years. I've been an employee for
[69:53] 22 years. I started working at 16. I'm
[69:55] 38 years old. And you know, now that
[69:58] I've been a Bitcoiner and now that I
[70:01] have some wealth that's given me a sense
[70:04] of first all those content, all those
[70:07] character attributes I talked about of
[70:10] which I would name three. Bitcoin has
[70:12] taught me patience, fearlessness, and
[70:16] open-mindedness. Those three things,
[70:19] fearlessness, patience, and
[70:20] open-mindedness. You keep those three
[70:22] things, you're a straight assassin.
[70:24] That's like the the Bitcoin assassins
[70:26] code. All the best assassins are
[70:28] patient, fearless, and open-minded,
[70:31] right? And I got to tell you that as
[70:34] much as I loved being a public school
[70:36] teacher, just the nature of being an
[70:38] employee,
[70:40] I almost feel like you can't be an
[70:41] employee anymore once you become a
[70:43] Bitcoiner. You just struggle with
[70:46] because here's the deal. As noble as
[70:48] teaching is, and there's nothing more
[70:50] noble, and I've done a lot of things,
[70:51] Robin, I've been a soldier, marine,
[70:54] whatever you want to call it, you know,
[70:56] soldiering, been a war fighter, been a
[70:59] doctor, been a lowly shelf stalker for
[71:02] grocery stores, sales, hospital
[71:05] employee, rough neck drilled water
[71:07] wells, grilling greens. There is nothing
[71:09] more noble than quite literally being a
[71:12] public school teacher where you just
[71:13] open your doors and you say, "Bring them
[71:15] in. bring in the kids and let's get to
[71:18] work. Nothing more noble. But even with
[71:21] that, you know, when you're an employee,
[71:24] it's not a 40-hour week. It's a 60-hour
[71:27] week because to be a for an employee,
[71:29] you got to get up 2 hours early to get
[71:31] ready. You got to cool down two hours
[71:33] after. You got your 8 hour workday. It's
[71:35] a 60-hour week. So 40 hours, you're
[71:38] getting paid for 40 hours. You're
[71:39] working 60 hours. And then you're
[71:41] getting paid $1,000 every two weeks. And
[71:44] you can't do that as a Bitcoiner. You
[71:46] just you won't it won't allow you to do
[71:48] it anymore. It won't allow you to do it
[71:51] anymore. But I was reaching this I was
[71:53] almost at a confliction because I
[71:56] couldn't be an employee anymore.
[71:58] And my soul just wasn't allow I was
[72:00] literally like just dragging myself to
[72:03] work as an employee. My soul was just
[72:06] like, man, this just isn't us anymore.
[72:08] But at the same time, you can get so
[72:10] conditioned in a certain routine. I
[72:13] mean, when you've been an employee for
[72:14] 22 years, it's just what you do. You get
[72:16] up, you go to work, you work your shift,
[72:18] right? You get paid every two weeks.
[72:20] Maybe you get your benefits, you get
[72:22] your this, you get your that. It's so
[72:24] hard to break Newton's first law, right?
[72:26] Object in motion stays in motion. Object
[72:28] at rest stays at rest. We'll try to
[72:30] change a routine that you've got 22
[72:32] years of momentum in. You've literally
[72:34] got to stop it, turn it around, and then
[72:36] gain momentum in another direction. It's
[72:38] brutal to do. And that's just Newton's
[72:40] first law. That's incredibly hard to do
[72:42] and I wouldn't have been able to do it
[72:44] if it wasn't for those lessons in
[72:46] Bitcoin of the patience, the
[72:48] fearlessness, and the open-mindedness.
[72:50] And a lot of it, too, was, you know, one
[72:52] thing that the students taught me was
[72:54] they they love social media, you know,
[72:57] and I'm an open-minded guy. A lot of it
[73:00] frustrates the older teachers. They get
[73:03] real mad if the students are playing on
[73:05] the phone and and exploring the phone. I
[73:08] felt like if every single one of them is
[73:10] doing it, they must be on to something.
[73:13] That that's the future. If the young new
[73:16] generation that scientifically has the
[73:18] highest IQs, that has the highest
[73:20] creativity, that's going to be
[73:22] tomorrow's leaders and commanders.
[73:25] It's not I need to I don't fight the
[73:27] wave. I join the wave. So, they're all
[73:30] on their phones and whatnot. And instead
[73:31] of me, you know, cuz they're respectful.
[73:34] They still learn the stuff that I'm
[73:35] teaching them when it's time to learn. I
[73:36] started learning from them. What are you
[73:38] doing on here? What's going on with
[73:39] this? Teach me. Right? So, they're
[73:42] teaching me like Tik Tok, Instagram, FA,
[73:45] all these different social media
[73:46] platforms. And I'm a little all over the
[73:48] place, but what's interesting is my
[73:50] whole life and I, like I said, I always
[73:51] look at the silver lining in teaching.
[73:54] What I learned that I really enjoy is I
[73:56] love having a little classroom space and
[73:59] then I love having like the students
[74:02] just be able to have kind of an open
[74:04] conversation. And I taught online as
[74:06] well. And one thing I loved about online
[74:08] was you're basically streaming and then
[74:10] the students are in the chat. So you're
[74:12] doing your thing like this on screen and
[74:15] then the chat's just kind of running
[74:17] wild and they're having their fun. And I
[74:18] really enjoyed that. It kind of reminded
[74:20] me of like I love the thought of those
[74:22] old Greek philosophers that would just
[74:24] open up their schools in Greece and
[74:26] anybody could kind of come in the forum
[74:28] and talk philosophy and talk about
[74:30] existence. And that's I I wanted that,
[74:33] but I couldn't have that as an employee
[74:35] because there's so much bureaucracy and
[74:36] bosses and administrators that really
[74:39] stifle your creativity that can stifle
[74:41] your philosophy. I don't just want to
[74:43] talk about science with my students.
[74:46] Long story short, I made a huge change.
[74:48] My teaching contract ended like three
[74:50] weeks ago and I just went all in on a
[74:55] social media company, a movement, a
[74:58] kingdom, whatever you want to call it.
[75:00] Vital Command.
[75:03] That's the name. That's my movement.
[75:05] That's my purpose, my mission. And
[75:08] really what it is is just anything that
[75:11] empowers. I really want people to just
[75:14] feel empowered and live purposeful
[75:17] lives. And whether however I can help in
[75:20] that, I want to do that. Whether it's
[75:22] just listening to somebody or offering
[75:25] some kind of advice, whether it's good
[75:27] or bad. Vital Command to me is about
[75:31] empowering people. Just like Bitcoin,
[75:33] Bitcoin empowers people. I want to do
[75:35] what Bitcoin did for me for people. I
[75:37] want to empower people. So that's what
[75:39] Vital Command is. And I found that the
[75:43] best way for me to do that was to create
[75:46] all these social media
[75:49] infrastructure
[75:50] and really focus in on the live aspect
[75:54] of it. I love the live aspect of it.
[75:56] being able to open up a live room and
[75:59] just hey kind of like uh Dioynes Dioynes
[76:03] was a great philosopher I loved in
[76:05] Greece he's one of the first guys to
[76:06] just like open up his school anyone
[76:08] could come in slave noble just come in
[76:11] and let's talk and learn that's what
[76:13] vital command's all about so I'm all in
[76:16] on this this social media company where
[76:20] essentially I just enjoy opening up my
[76:23] live room and being the host
[76:26] and listening and learning and talking
[76:28] and making little lessons and creating
[76:30] content to just a post for people to
[76:32] think about and provoke thought if they
[76:34] want or they can provoke my thought.
[76:36] Just today I was on this morning before
[76:37] I was with you for an hour in my live
[76:39] room on TikTok. I met a freaking doctor
[76:42] in engineering. I met people from
[76:45] Pakistan, from India, from Serbia. This
[76:47] guy from Serbia taught me all about
[76:49] these the Serbian music. In one hour, I
[76:52] meet all these people around the world
[76:54] teaching me things. I got this little
[76:56] lesson drawn on that whiteboard that I
[76:58] was just sitting at. I moved, by the
[76:59] way, because the guys are working on uh
[77:01] they're doing their landscaping, so it
[77:03] got a little loud. Robin, I made a big
[77:05] change. Long story short, I know I'm all
[77:06] over the place, but I was inspired to
[77:08] just make a big change. Really listen to
[77:09] my soul. really do something that is
[77:11] both feels challenging again to where
[77:15] I'm not waking up dragging myself to go
[77:17] do it because that's what employment was
[77:19] turning into. Me waking up and dragging
[77:22] myself into it to where now I'm waking
[77:24] up excited and actually the work is
[77:27] harder. I'm even more I'm actually more
[77:28] tired than I was as an employee because
[77:30] I'm pushing my mind harder. I'm pushing
[77:33] my creativity harder. I'm so excited
[77:36] that I can't even sleep at night because
[77:37] I already want it to be 6:00 a.m. so I
[77:40] could get my kids to school and like get
[77:42] into my my live room and open it up for
[77:44] people to come in cuz I'm so hungry to
[77:47] run these live chats and run vital
[77:49] command and see where it's going to go
[77:51] and just enjoy my life and and it's
[77:53] great and it's been going I just started
[77:56] right it's been 3 weeks I just I stopped
[77:58] being employed literally 3 weeks ago
[78:00] after 22 years and I'd call it now
[78:02] self-employment I I wouldn't call it
[78:04] entrepreneurial work or anything like
[78:05] that it's selfmployment but I love the
[78:08] word self Right. Finding yourself. I'm
[78:11] finding myself at 38.
[78:15] That's powerful, dude. Truly finding
[78:19] myself at 38. It is up. It's
[78:21] beautiful, man.
 This crucial moment of
[78:25] if you want to get to the other side of
[78:27] entrepreneurship and and and being a
[78:29] leader in in in some space, you have to
[78:32] take that one small step back which is
[78:35] called self-employment.
[78:37] And I I call it a step a small step back
[78:40] to make later two steps forwards. And
[78:43] and I'm not at two steps forwards. I'm I
[78:46] do have three uh part-time freelancers
[78:49] working with me, but I'm far away from
[78:51] an entrepreneur. Um but I made that
[78:55] small step uh backwards literally a year
[78:58] and what is it 2 3 months ago. Um
[79:02] because
[79:03] so why do I call it a small steps
[79:05] backwards? Because you are basically
[79:08] still having a job and a job's pay, but
[79:11] you have to care for everything. So your
[79:16] mind is already entrepreneurial and you
[79:19] have to care for the infrastructure, the
[79:21] processes and everything that you don't
[79:23] have to care for when you are an
[79:26] employer employee.
[79:28] But you're also doing the work.
[79:31] you're also doing uh the tasks, the
[79:34] creativities, the the all the things
[79:36] that a company has different employees
[79:38] for. So, you definitely make eyes a
[79:42] short step back
[79:45] um to maybe later on if you're
[79:48] successful make two or three steps
[79:50] forward. And uh what I found is the most
[79:56] dangerous things towards those steps are
[80:00] the distraction that come your way that
[80:03] are positive then negative distractions
[80:06] uh distractions but be like if you are
[80:10] passionate about something you you don't
[80:11] let yourself distract by negative distru
[80:13] uh distractions but positive
[80:15] distractions of a company offering a job
[80:20] that a year ago Oh, you would have died
[80:22] for. I I I literally have job offers
[80:26] from companies that I love. uh and the
[80:29] the jobs are really good and a year ago
[80:32] I would have been like let's do it like
[80:35] right like right this second and now I'm
[80:37] like no actually I'm I'm building
[80:40] something bigger here and it's I I don't
[80:43] want to take this position even though I
[80:45] would earn more have more comfort and uh
[80:50] probably have more time also with the
[80:51] family but I'm sacrificing today for
[80:54] something bigger and I think that that
[80:56] self-employment journey And hopefully
[80:58] I'll I get to be an entrepreneur at some
[81:00] point in my life. That entrepreneurial
[81:02] journey so I can also report from that
[81:05] um is something deeply
[81:08] meaningful and deeply
[81:11] um yeah I've already said it before. I'm
[81:14] not spiritual but I think it's a
[81:15] spiritual journey where you discover
[81:17] yourself and you discover your demons
[81:19] and discover uh what works good in your
[81:22] body and mind and what doesn't not does
[81:24] not work good in in your mind and your
[81:26] body. Robin, I'm I'm literally hanging
[81:28] on your every word. I'm I'm nodding be
[81:30] not out of like, yeah, yeah, been there,
[81:32] done that. I'm nodding out of just
[81:33] absorbing everything that you're saying
[81:35] because the journey that I know you've
[81:37] been on now for years of all this
[81:40] experience that you just literally
[81:42] dropped some pearls. That was pure
[81:45] pearls. Years of experience talking,
[81:47] right, with years to go to a guy who's
[81:50] just been doing it for three weeks. I
[81:52] nod because I'm just hanging on your
[81:54] every word and already seeing bits and
[81:57] pieces of that.
[81:59] I'm 38 so I've got a little bit I was an
[82:02] employee for longer and I am so grateful
[82:06] because I learned so much as my time in
[82:08] employee. There's a season of
[82:10] everything, right? You entered your
[82:11] season earlier than me. I'm coming into
[82:14] the season now and everyone the life is
[82:16] just seasons. So I'm in the now just
[82:19] entering the season of the self that
[82:22] what you just described. I'm just coming
[82:23] into that season and you talking about
[82:26] it as the wizard as the guy is two year
[82:29] more years in more years into that
[82:31] season. I just hang on your every word.
[82:34] But it's interesting because I've
[82:35] already seen little samples of that
[82:38] especially like you said the positive
[82:39] stuff. One of my one of my uh things
[82:42] that I post to is LinkedIn, right? And I
[82:45] post all my content to LinkedIn for fun.
[82:47] And again, everything you said, I mean,
[82:49] just a year ago, I would have killed to
[82:52] get these position offers as like a life
[82:55] coach, uh, a life strategist, all these
[82:58] companies that are happy to hire people
[83:00] who will sit down with people online,
[83:03] pay them six figures to work with like
[83:05] people like that. basically like what
[83:07] I'm doing in my my live chat room,
[83:09] working on empowering people and
[83:11] learning from people and just inspiring
[83:13] and providing ideas and inspiration and
[83:15] receiving it, getting these like job
[83:18] offers right away because of these
[83:20] people looking at the content on
[83:21] LinkedIn and like, "Dude, we'll hire
[83:22] you. Why don't you just do what you're
[83:23] doing with us as our employee and we'll
[83:26] pay you well?" And it's like, damn,
[83:28] where was all this like uh a year or two
[83:30] ago when I was in the employee mindset?
[83:33] So, you're Nostra Nostra Robin, man. No,
[83:35] instead of nor do straight Nostro Robin.
[83:40] That was beautiful. Thank you, Robin.
[83:42] Thank you for your wisdom. That's cool.
[83:44] I was meant to be here today. I'll keep
[83:45] an eye out on everything you just said.
[83:47] Thanks for the pearls.
[83:49] Yeah, it's uh it's a crazy You're too
[83:51] kind, man. Like I
[83:54] I got a lot to make up for, Robin. I'm
[83:56] still trying I'm trying to get to
[83:57] heaven, dude.
[84:00] I love that. Um, I have I have one
[84:03] question that I ask each and every one
[84:04] of my returning guests. And the question
[84:07] is, what have you learned since your
[84:10] last podcast episode with me outside of
[84:12] Bitcoin?
[84:14] Wow. I tell you what, I've really
[84:16] learned, you know what, I've learned a
[84:18] lot about that you will
[84:22] grow more. I've truly learned that there
[84:25] are no accidents, Robin. I have
[84:27] conviction that there are no accidents.
[84:29] You know, the last time we spoke, I was
[84:31] working my dream job. I was working as
[84:35] an online school teacher, which was
[84:37] perfect. It was remote. My students
[84:40] loved me. My boss loved me. I had the
[84:42] best boss. I had the best admin. I had
[84:44] the best setup you could possibly have.
[84:47] I would have done it the rest of my
[84:49] life. I woke up every day happy to go to
[84:52] work. Every day happy to go to work. And
[84:55] you know what? Out of nowhere, it just
[84:58] ended. it just straight got its funding
[85:01] pulled for just money reasons, fiat
[85:04] reasons, right?
[85:06] Gone. Just gone in one day. Everything
[85:10] can just come to an end in one day. And
[85:13] you know, when I was working that job, I
[85:14] felt like from the deepest of my heart,
[85:17] I'm like, "Wow, this is it. Everything
[85:19] I've worked for in life has led me here.
[85:21] I'm getting my due finally getting to
[85:24] just stay home and work at home. I get
[85:25] to be with my wife and kids more. I'm
[85:27] saving gas, tons of time, I love my job,
[85:29] my students, everything's going right
[85:31] and then it just came to an abrupt
[85:34] devastating end and it was just cast
[85:36] right back out into the wilderness.
[85:39] And you know what? You can take that
[85:42] these things will happen and it's easy
[85:44] to if it doesn't happen by accident
[85:49] though. Nothing happens by accident
[85:52] because now where I'm at, and that
[85:54] happened a year ago. Here I am a year
[85:57] later and it's honestly been a brutal a
[86:00] brutal year since then from that time
[86:02] period that everything came crashing
[86:04] down.
[86:05] But it's interesting that we're talking
[86:07] today because just in the last probably
[86:10] few months or so as things started to
[86:13] play out even more as you see time go on
[86:17] these things that seem like you just
[86:20] caught a really bad break or the
[86:21] universe is truly just cold and dark and
[86:24] suffering and there's no point to it all
[86:27] and you just
[86:29] No, it's not. There are no accidents,
[86:31] Robin. Everything happens for a reason.
[86:34] I wouldn't trade. I 100% if I went back,
[86:38] I wouldn't have it any other way. That
[86:40] job needed to end. That needed to be
[86:42] taken from me. That needed to be torn
[86:44] from me. I needed to feel that. I needed
[86:47] to suffer that loss. And that's not the
[86:50] only one, man. I mean, I'm someone who,
[86:52] you know, when I was 16,
[86:55] my parents went from just being a happy
[86:58] family to just gone. Found out my
[87:00] parents were both having an affair.
[87:02] divorce left for other families, right?
[87:05] Gone. No parents anymore. Gone. Well,
[87:08] just
[87:10] time and time again, I've seen so much
[87:12] beauty end in just one day. I've seen
[87:16] years of beauty die in one day, followed
[87:18] by then years of suffering again and
[87:20] again and again. But it taught it's it
[87:23] always teaches me and it really drove it
[87:25] home from the last time we talked until
[87:27] now. I was the h you dude the last time
[87:29] we talked I was on cloud9 man I was so
[87:33] freaking happy when we tal I'm happy
[87:34] again you caught me again on a you
[87:36] always catch me on a good one you're
[87:38] just a good good energy for whatever
[87:40] reason when I run into you but
[87:42] specifically from the last time we tal
[87:43] it happened again man my my happy little
[87:46] perfect beautiful world was torn from me
[87:48] again I went back into the suffering and
[87:50] pain cycle and then once again I just
[87:53] learned damn happened for a reason
[87:56] there's no accidents there's There's no
[87:58] accidents. Just let it play out. Just
[88:00] have faith. Have faith in the process.
[88:02] You don't need to be religious. You
[88:02] don't need to be spiritual. You know,
[88:04] Robin's a great Look at these two two
[88:06] guys of an opposite coin. A religious
[88:08] zealot and a non-religious guy. But what
[88:10] do we both do, Robin? I think we've both
[88:12] learned to trust the process.
[88:15] Trust the process. I never truly trusted
[88:18] the process until this just last
[88:20] devastating thing that happened between
[88:22] the last time we talked. I trust the
[88:24] process now. That's what I've learned.
[88:26] Trust the process. See it play out. And
[88:29] you're going to die anyways. Don't be
[88:31] too bitter about it. You're going to die
[88:32] anyways. It's okay. Trust the process.
[88:35] Everything happens for a reason. There
[88:36] are no accidents.
[88:40] When was this with when your parents
[88:42] kind of um uh cheated on each other?
[88:46] Yeah, dude. Oh my god. Yeah. Maybe a
[88:48] different channel and a different
[88:50] content. I was 16. Yeah. had literally
[88:52] just the happiest little I mean, you
[88:54] know, typical upbringing, man. Just
[88:56] good, beautiful parents that were hard
[88:58] asses because they needed to be. And,
[89:00] you know, my dad taught me to hunt and
[89:02] fish and fight and kill and all the
[89:03] things you ought to teach a young man.
[89:04] And mom taught me all the ways that
[89:07] taught me everything a young man should
[89:08] learn. Great parents, you know, uh,
[89:10] living in a nice neighborhood, a nice
[89:12] house. And, you know, one day I get this
[89:14] text on my phone, my dad's saying my
[89:16] mom's a cheater. I get this text from my
[89:18] mom saying my dad's a cheater. And I'm
[89:20] just blown away. And next thing I know,
[89:22] literally within 24 hours, my mom's with
[89:25] a new family, my dad's with a new
[89:26] family, and they're gone. And it's just
[89:30] that fast. And all of a sudden, that was
[89:31] it. I was on my own. 24 hours, dude.
 And
[89:34] you got a a text
[89:36] text.
[89:38] Oh gosh.
 On a Nokia. This was back when
[89:40] like Nokia was like the Whoa, you got a
[89:43] Nokia for texting. Yeah. And I don't I
[89:46] don't judge him, Robin. You know, that
[89:47] that taught me a lot about you just you
[89:49] don't judge people. and and not judging
[89:51] your parents and realizing they're just
[89:53] people just like you and people make
[89:55] mistakes. And you know, I've I've since
[89:57] gone on to do far more horrible things,
[90:00] far more horrible things than anything
[90:01] my parents have ever done. It's really
[90:03] relieved me of a lot of judgment of
[90:05] them. And I think they texted me because
[90:06] they couldn't look me in the eye and
[90:07] tell me. So I don't judge them for for
[90:10] that. I don't it's probably hard to look
[90:12] me in the eye and tell me that. But
[90:15] things end things, you know, when you're
[90:16] high up on and stay humble, I guess,
[90:18] right? when you're on top of the world
[90:20] and everything's going your way, man,
[90:22] dude, drop to your knees. Just drop to
[90:24] your knees. And if you're not religious,
[90:26] find a way to be humble and just just
[90:28] say thank you and and just know that it
[90:30] can all come to that it all everything
[90:32] comes to an end sooner or later. So,
[90:35] just always keep that in the back of
[90:36] your mind, especially when you're riding
[90:37] a high, especially when times are good.
[90:40] When times are good, man, be so freaking
[90:42] grateful if you can. And it's just 24
[90:45] hours, 1 hour, 2 hours. Heck, last week
[90:48] that that car accident I told you about,
[90:50] I could be dead. It straight up died. I
[90:53] watched a literal insane car accident a
[90:56] week ago happened right next to me,
[90:59] inches away from including me from my
[91:01] driver's side door that fast. And I was
[91:03] driving home with the happiest smile on
[91:05] my face, thinking about having family
[91:06] with my dinner and how I got this
[91:08] beautiful wife, beautiful kids, and
[91:10] beautiful wife. And boom, could have
[91:12] been gone in just one freaking second,
[91:14] man.
[91:16] Gratitude. Gratitude. And trust the
[91:18] process. And take the suffering. Take
[91:21] the pain. Take the pain. Look for the
[91:24] lesson. Feel the le the lesson will
[91:26] reveal itself. A lot of people are
[91:28] suffering. Dude, been working with young
[91:30] people now three years. They're
[91:32] suffering. Robin, the teenagers,
[91:34] especially in America, the young people
[91:36] in America, they're suffering deeply,
[91:38] deeply, deeply. And I just emphasize
[91:40] you're suffering. It's okay. Go through
[91:42] the process. So I try to be there for
[91:44] them. That's why I like to be vital
[91:45] command. I like people to just be able
[91:47] to come to me, especially the broken. A
[91:49] lot of broken people are coming to me.
[91:52] It's interesting and it it's almost like
[91:54] it's for a reason. So, I could look at
[91:56] them like a shattered man. And I'm a
[91:58] shattered, degenerate, pathetic man and
[92:01] just be like, "Dude, just go with it,
[92:02] man. Trust the process. It's cool." If
[92:05] the universe gives a guy like me, If the
[92:08] universe gives a guy like me beautiful
[92:10] things, Bitcoin, right, Robin sir, the
[92:13] woman I'm married to, oh, a children, if
[92:16] if the universe gives a guy like me, and
[92:18] I come from cutthroats and scoundrels. I
[92:20] come from bad dudes, Robin. If if the
[92:22] universe rewards a guy like me, it'll re
[92:24] it will reward anyone. You just got to
[92:26] hang in there. Trust the process. Take
[92:29] the suffering.
[92:32] That's beautiful. Wow, I love that.
[92:36] It I'm there's many different questions,
[92:39] but
[92:41] I'm I'm I'm fascinated mostly by how
[92:44] both parents at the same time kind of
[92:46] like cheat on each other and that like
[92:49] that that's that's amazes me because
[92:51] like I only heard stories where like one
[92:54] is like a little bit more the the
[92:56] initiator uh and and cheats. But uh it's
[93:00] it's it's interesting and and also those
[93:03] those shattering moments where and
[93:05] gratitude is an interesting one. Um
[93:09] where I had it only once in my life and
[93:12] then and I cannot tell the story without
[93:14] revealing uh personal things about
[93:16] another person. So I would never do
[93:18] that. But basically I had a person that
[93:20] was very close to me. I met it I met her
[93:24] and and she was was crying and I thought
[93:26] like and then I had an idea what
[93:27] happened.
[93:29] Uh and I was like, "Oh what should
[93:31] I say?" Like, "How can I comfort her?"
[93:34] And then she told me what happened and
[93:39] it was still bad, but it was way better
[93:44] than what I have imagined.
[93:46] And I just smile
[93:49] and because I thought this very bad
[93:51] thing happened. This very very bad thing
[93:54] happened. And uh then I was like okay it
[93:58] did not happen. And uh I was just
[94:01] smiling and she was like why are you
[94:03] smiling like because I thought this
[94:06] happened to you and now I see that only
[94:08] this happened to you and even though
[94:10] this is annoying and bad but imagine
[94:14] this would have happened to you. and
[94:15] she's like, "Oh shit." Yeah, true. I
[94:17] guess this did not happen to me and I
[94:19] guess the day is really good. So
[94:21] gratitude is is actually imagining
[94:24] something really bad happened. Like
[94:26] imagine you you go to the doctor today
[94:29] and he tells you you have cancer and
[94:31] most likely you have three four to four
[94:33] months to live.
[94:35] Now come back to reality and imagine
[94:38] that this actually does not that that's
[94:40] not the thing.
[94:42] So you actually
[94:45] uh don't have it. So you can be grateful
[94:48] that you can normally breathe and even
[94:50] let's say even you if you have gotten
[94:52] today the message of you have cancer and
[94:57] you actually uh have a very small chance
[95:00] of surviving the next year. Even then
[95:03] you can say hey I'm I'm grateful that
[95:06] I'm still alive. I could also on the way
[95:08] to the doctor die in a car accident. So
[95:12] like
[95:14] gratitude, that's a weird thing with
[95:16] gratitude because you can be very
[95:19] grateful for things that haven't
[95:21] happened to you or things that have
[95:23] happened to you and and I I guess that's
[95:26] the and and we always forget uh the
[95:29] things we have accomplished and how good
[95:30] our lives actually are because we are so
[95:33] so overwhelmed. It's a man it's a you
[95:36] you are you are transforming my Bitcoin
[95:38] podcast into something else. It goes
[95:41] both ways, Robin. Do we play off each
[95:43] other? 100%. And I Yeah, for real. And I
[95:46] think you the experience you had with
[95:47] that young lady is is perspective, too,
[95:49] right? Like it could always be worse. I
[95:51] think that is gratitude or a component
[95:54] of it is certainly perspective. Uh I
[95:56] listened to a lot of Alan Watts. I'll do
[95:58] quick on this one, but he said something
[95:59] cool about how like I think this
[96:00] explains a lot of uh violence, right? If
[96:03] you look at like the blood under a
[96:04] microscopic level, it's just literally
[96:06] microorganisms just chewing the hell out
[96:08] of each other. like within your own body
[96:11] is just microorganisms chewing the
[96:13] absolute hell out of each other, ripping
[96:16] each other apart. It's a devastating war
[96:19] going on in you throughout your whole
[96:20] body. If that's your only perspective,
[96:22] you would think that this world was
[96:24] literally like uh, you know, like the
[96:26] D&D worlds where it's an evil deity
[96:28] ruling it. if your only perspective was
[96:30] at the molecular level. But when you
[96:32] zoom out and then here we are, you and I
[96:35] sitting talking about these beautiful
[96:36] things, being kind and peaceful with one
[96:38] another, to think that on a molecular
[96:40] level right now is just a war raging on
[96:43] inside both of us. At this current
[96:45] moment, there are just millions,
[96:47] billions of trillions of microorganisms
[96:49] dying horribly inside of your body as we
[96:52] speak. But as you zoom out, there's
[96:54] peace and beauty and zen. And then you
[96:57] can just keep doing that. Here we are on
[96:59] Earth chewing the hell out of each
[97:00] other, cutting each other's throats,
[97:02] tearing each other apart. Zoom out. You
[97:05] can't just zoom out. There's got to be
[97:07] harmony. That always plays out. Zoom
[97:09] out. There's harmony and zen on a higher
[97:12] level. And onward and onward and onward.
[97:14] Perspective. 100%. You nailed it, man.
[97:16] Perspective.
[97:18] Perspective.
 There's a there's a great
[97:20] uh end routine that we do in the podcast
[97:22] where the previous guest is asking a
[97:23] question for the next guest without
[97:24] knowing who the next guest is. And it's
[97:26] an it might fit nicely, but it might
[97:28] also not fit nicely in this
[97:30] conversation. Um, what keeps you up at
[97:32] night in Bitcoin?
[97:34] Oh man. No, that's a perfect question.
[97:36] Gosh. Well, right now, just the
[97:38] excitement. Oh my god. I mean, I spend
[97:40] way too many nights on my phone just
[97:43] watching the charts, watching the
[97:46] especially when we talked about, right,
[97:48] the leveraging and whatnot. So, yeah,
[97:51] you want to be up at night all night. go
[97:53] ahead and get yourself into some
[97:54] leveraging situations and you'll be
[97:56] like, "Oh man, what is go? Oh my god, it
[97:58] can become an obsession. It can become
[98:01] an obsession. It's almost better to put
[98:03] your stuff in cold storage so you can go
[98:05] think about other things." And if you
[98:06] can do that. Uh but yeah, there there is
[98:09] great obsession right now with the
[98:12] leveraging play that keeps me up at
[98:15] night both mostly through excitement and
[98:19] because every day there's something new
[98:21] I learn about Bitcoin. So it's beautiful
[98:25] really. But Bitcoin keeps me up plenty
[98:28] of nights thinking thinking about my own
[98:32] play on the individual level. thinking
[98:34] about what the future will hold.
[98:37] Thinking about all the different things
[98:39] that I will explore in Bitcoin, all the
[98:42] different technology,
[98:44] the layer 2 stuff, the nodes, the future
[98:47] me, the Bitcoin standard. Bitcoin will
[98:50] steal your sleep. Bitcoin steals plenty
[98:52] of my sleep. So, and for lots of
[98:54] different reasons. That's a great
[98:55] question from that guest. When you're a
[98:57] Bitcoiner, man, you'll lose some sleep,
[98:59] but you'll lose it from excitement
[99:01] because you just like can't you don't
[99:03] want to miss anything, right?
[99:06] You don't want to miss one move. You
[99:07] don't want to miss nothing.
 I I Yeah,
[99:10] it's like you you you get this Bitcoin
[99:12] send, but also like there's so much
[99:13] going on that's like excites you. It's
[99:15] it it's a it's a weird weird It's What a
[99:18] time to be alive. I think that's that's
[99:20] kind of summarizing everything.
[99:23] Thank you. Thank you so much, Derek, for
[99:26] it's it's has been a real pleasure
[99:28] having you on the podcast again. Uh it's
