[00:00] And it gets worse over time. And the
[00:01] more fear you have, the worse illness
[00:04] gets. And the more Bitcoin you have, the
[00:06] healthier you get. So like it's a
[00:08] financial growth. So from Bitcoiners,
[00:10] you can actually learn about
[00:11] entrepreneurship, you can learn about uh
[00:14] diet, you can learn about sports, you
[00:15] can learn about all those great things.
[00:17] I'm just talking about Yeah, Robin.
[00:19] Robin told me to quit my job. No big
[00:20] deal. It's all right.
 Who the heck is
[00:22] Robin?
[00:24] It's so interesting to see how deep the
[00:29] impact of Bitcoin actually is because
[00:32] it's money. Bitcoin is the the closest
[00:34] thing to having something stable in in
[00:37] in life basically.
[00:41] [Music]
[00:43] I did enjoy this episode with Ralph so
[00:46] much so I wanted to share this also with
[00:48] you. The two main topics that we
[00:50] discussed in this episode with Ralph was
[00:54] first the Bitcoin paradigm shift and I
[00:56] think this is still something that most
[00:58] people and even some Bitcoiners don't
[01:00] get how fundamental Bitcoin is changing
[01:03] all our lives and how important is to
[01:07] understand this very thing. Most people
[01:09] still look at it as an investment. It's
[01:11] way more. It's like a a whole other
[01:14] paradigm shift. And this is something
[01:15] that most people don't get. And this is
[01:18] why I always press on this uh thing that
[01:22] most people don't get that bitcoin is a
[01:24] paradigm shift. And then also the second
[01:26] topic that we kind of discussed is how
[01:28] important and why it is important to
[01:30] also talk about that and orange pill uh
[01:33] other people are on that because the
[01:35] paradigm shift is so important and so um
[01:38] so shifting of all our societies that's
[01:41] why we have to talk about that and along
[01:43] the way as always I answer some personal
[01:45] questions some behind the scenes
[01:47] questions h I think it's really
[01:49] interesting stuff that Ralph talked
[01:51] about and the Ralph asked me about and
[01:53] yeah enjoy this episode where I'm on the
[01:55] other side of the mic. I'm not the host,
[01:57] I'm the guest. Enjoy it.
 Welcome to the
[01:59] Bitcoin RX podcast. This is your host,
[02:01] Nurse Ralph. Today, I got with me Robin,
[02:04] who is a legend for his daily podcast
[02:08] post, and he's going to help me give you
[02:10] your weekly dose of orange pill so you
[02:12] don't die from fiat disease. Robin, how
[02:15] you doing, man?
 I love the intro. I love
[02:18] the intro. Yeah, you definitely you
[02:20] should not die from Fiat. Yeah, that you
[02:22] you should you should get your daily or
[02:24] monthly or weekly dose of Bitcoin.
[02:26] That's for sure.
 Oh, yeah. It is it is a
[02:29] very it's a it's a chronic illness.
[02:32] It is. And it gets worse over time. And
[02:34] the more fear you have, the worse
[02:37] illness gets. And the more Bitcoin you
[02:38] have, the better uh you the healthier
[02:41] you get. So like it's a financial
[02:43] growth.
 That's true. That's true. I
[02:45] know. Bitcoin is the medication, man. I
[02:47] like that. So, yo, you you have like you
[02:50] have like 400 is it four or 500
[02:53] different guests that you've had so far.
[02:55] So, I recorded this week my 5 and2nd or
[03:00] third episode. Uh, but some of them uh I
[03:05] had to delete. So, it's like around 500
[03:07] episodes, I guess. And some of the
[03:09] guests have been uh reappeared. So, I
[03:13] think it's about like 400. Let's just
[03:16] for fun sake, let's say 420 guests I had
[03:19] on.
 That's actually Wow, that's
[03:21] impressive. This is only my uh ninth
[03:23] podcast, so I'm I feel like I I have a
[03:25] lot to learn from you.
 Oh, you you you
[03:28] will learn it from experience. I think
[03:30] uh it's it's really great when you have
[03:32] a podcast and and you learn a lot about
[03:34] Bitcoin, but you definitely learn a lot
[03:36] about speaking and socially engaging
[03:40] with people and about life in general.
[03:42] There's so many lessons outside of
[03:44] Bitcoin that you get from Bitcoiners
[03:46] because Bitcoiners are talking and uh
[03:50] knowing a lot of things like they
[03:52] experience life and they're talking with
[03:54] a lot of great people and they do a lot
[03:57] of great stuff. So from Bitcoiners you
[04:00] can actually learn about
[04:01] entrepreneurship, you can learn about uh
[04:03] uh diet, you can learn about sports, you
[04:05] can learn about all those great things
[04:07] from Bitcoiners that have nothing to do
[04:10] with Bitcoin actually just because
[04:11] Bitcoiners are quite uh critical
[04:14] thinkers and uh I also saw I also see
[04:18] Bitcoiners as really ambitious people.
[04:20] They some of them are retired, some of
[04:23] them don't have to work at all but they
[04:25] still do every day. that that it's kind
[04:28] of it's really fascinating to see
[04:30] Bitcoiners.
 Yeah. Yeah. Because I feel
[04:32] like it also like a lot of Bitcoiners
[04:34] they have time to actually think about
[04:37] other stuff and not just like they
[04:38] they're not stuck um doing a job that
[04:41] they don't enjoy doing. So I think I
[04:43] think I think having the ability to do
[04:45] other things, doing things that you
[04:47] actually enjoy doing just gives you that
[04:49] other um aspect of life and gives you
[04:52] more life in a way, you know. So I mean
[04:54] that's that's how I see it, you know. So
[04:56] that's amazing, you know,
 100%.
 Yeah.
[04:59] And um before we start diving into
[05:01] Bitcoin, tell us a little bit about um
[05:03] your journey before Bitcoin.
[05:06] My journey before Bitcoin is quite short
[05:09] because I'm I'm just uh now 25. Oh gosh,
[05:14] I have to think how old I am.
[05:18] Getting by and you're like, am I 25 or
[05:21] 26?
[05:24] No. like uh I I am uh 26. I'm actually
[05:28] getting uh 27 this year. I I can't
[05:31] believe it. Wow. Like I'm I'm getting
[05:32] old also. Um and uh my journey before
[05:37] Bitcoin is before 21 years old. So I'm
[05:41] in bit Oh, I'm also long in Bitcoin
[05:42] already. So in when I was 21 years old,
[05:46] 22, somewhere along those lines were the
[05:49] first touch points with Bitcoin. before
[05:52] that um I think the most important uh
[05:55] story from before that and I just keep
[05:57] it really um really brief is that I was
[06:01] always a very saving personality. I
[06:03] remember as a small kid when I got lunch
[06:06] money from my uh parents uh I saved uh
[06:11] one two from that lunch money to be safe
[06:14] and to have more money. I don't I didn't
[06:17] know why. I just know that I like those
[06:20] coins and I want to collect them. Uh
[06:22] that's that's all I knew as a as a small
[06:24] kid about money. And I was like I can I
[06:27] can eat a little bit less at lunchtime
[06:30] uh and I can eat more at dinner because
[06:32] dinner is at home and at home food is
[06:35] for free. It's not free but like someone
[06:37] else pays it. So I think it's a money.
[06:40] It it it was so bad that at some point
[06:42] my mom saw me at the supermarket and I
[06:45] was only buying like a very small finger
[06:47] like very small bread and she she felt
[06:49] bad for me and then gave me more more
[06:51] money to to that that I eat something
[06:53] nice for for lunch.
 You were cheap.
[06:58] I was very cheap. I'm still very cheap
[07:00] honestly
[07:02] if you want to frame it negatively. But
[07:04] the the important thing is I was always
[07:06] a savings personality from from the
[07:08] get-go. And I think that's what allowed
[07:10] me to get into Bitcoin early on because
[07:13] most 21 year olds don't get Bitcoin.
[07:16] They they might be in crypto but they
[07:18] don't get Bitcoin which is a funny thing
[07:20] because they want to gamble in shitcoin
[07:22] casino. And so when I see um when when
[07:26] I'm in in in Bitcoin with with 21 22
[07:29] years old already uh this is basically
[07:31] the time like I only was there because
[07:36] with 18 years old I started my first job
[07:39] and I was very saving. Um I still live
[07:42] with my parents. Uh I I didn't need
[07:45] anything basically. I I don't know maybe
[07:47] need 100 per per month nothing else. And
[07:51] if you work next to school, you might
[07:53] make like 500 bucks. But if you make 500
[07:56] bucks and you only need a hundred bucks,
[07:58] you're saving €400 each month. Not a lot
[08:01] of people actually save €400 each month
[08:04] uh with 18 years old. So I already had
[08:07] capital to allocate. So with 18 years
[08:10] old, I was getting on the quest where do
[08:12] I put my money? Do I put it in a savings
[08:15] account? Do I put it in a stock? Do I
[08:17] put it in real estate? And all those
[08:20] things I got through. So I started with
[08:23] a savings account, got like 0.1 interest
[08:26] rate, percent interest rate. I was like
[08:28] that that's that's that's
 that's
[08:30] nothing.
 That's nothing. Uh I calculated
[08:33] it and I was like yeah that's that's
[08:34] less than nothing. That's like uh
[08:37] literally nothing. And then uh I went to
[08:40] the in more things. So I tried ETFs, I
[08:43] tried fonts, I tried all different kinds
[08:45] of things. But eventually I f found
[08:49] stocks for me. I found individual stock
[08:52] picking for me. And I was in school that
[08:54] one kid that sit sat at the back of the
[08:57] class and had his laptop out and read 10
[09:02] Q's and 10K uh reports from stocks
[09:06] because uh I wanted to pick stocks. uh
[09:09] the other kids that with the laptop uh
[09:11] like played some games or uh did some
[09:14] social media scrolling and a few kids
[09:16] actually paid attention to the class.
[09:18] Those those were also but I was never
[09:21] one of those unfortunately or
[09:22] fortunately in in in my case. Um so uh I
[09:28] was really into stocks. I was really
[09:29] into stocks picking and I also got to
[09:32] know that uh because I was quite good in
[09:34] it and I was kind of get got also lucky
[09:36] in it because I was just in an upwards
[09:38] trend of of the market in general. So I
[09:41] picked Tesla, I picked Apple, I picked
[09:43] Facebook, I picked Alphabet. Uh fa
[09:46] Facebook is now called Meta. So there's
[09:48] like a lot of different tech stocks
[09:50] because I was a software engineer and I
[09:53] just bought all the main stocks that you
[09:56] can buy and obviously they all went up
[09:58] because I went in a really good time. I
[10:01] didn't knew what I was doing.
[10:03] the full disclosure I was just like in
[10:05] the in that uh era
[10:08] and then we come to the point where more
[10:11] and more people kept asking me like hey
[10:13] you're doing good with stocks what about
[10:15] that Bitcoin thing are you doing
[10:17] anything with Bitcoin and those are non-
[10:19] Bitcoiners people that haven't even uh
[10:22] discovered Bitcoin and they will ask me
[10:24] what do you think about Bitcoin and I
[10:26] was saying that's a scam like it has no
[10:29] cash flow it's like it's like gold But
[10:32] uh fantasy gold I think I called it in
[10:34] back in the day. Uh and uh I I basically
[10:39] came to the conclusion at some point
[10:40] that people kept asking me and I didn't
[10:44] had enough arguments against Bitcoin. So
[10:46] I went ahead and said hey I want to
[10:50] prove people wrong. I want to prove them
[10:53] that Bitcoin actually is a scam. And
[10:56] with that I discovered Bitcoin. So I I I
[10:59] wanted to find the mistake. I wanted to
[11:01] find why it's a scam. And then I went
[11:04] really deep down the rabbit hole and I
[11:06] basically discovered Bitcoin. And this
[11:09] was I think around 2020. So 2020 I was
[11:14] 21 years old when I discovered it. Uh
[11:17] and yeah, it was it was it was really
[11:19] good. Oh yeah, that's amazing man
[11:21] because I have a I have a similar story
[11:23] where I was always a saver as a kid too
[11:26] and then I I mean I I did not know
[11:28] anything about the inflation and all
[11:30] that and then I think around like 20
[11:33] 2019 2020 is when I finally started like
[11:36] looking into stocks and starting to
[11:38] learn about like you know like PE ratio
[11:41] all of those things cash flow all of
[11:43] that and and then eventually like it's
[11:45] the same thing I I I think um I think um
[11:48] I It it was the book um the Bitcoin
[11:51] standard that got me going. I was like I
[11:54] I I wanted to cuz when I first read it I
[11:57] was like there is no way that this thing
[11:59] is true and I wanted to actually double
[12:01] check to see is it true cuz I didn't
[12:03] know anything about like the history of
[12:05] money or anything. So I wanted to like
[12:06] be like is this true? Like we've had
[12:09] other forms of money in the past. Is it
[12:10] is it true that we've had all of this?
[12:13] And then once once I could not like
[12:15] prove that book wrong or once I couldn't
[12:17] prove civ sephid amus wrong, I was like
[12:20] okay I guess I should really look into
[12:23] this thing. This is this is real. Yeah.
[12:25] This is super interesting what you just
[12:27] said with like uh are there actually
[12:29] were there actually other forms of money
[12:32] because this was also my frame of
[12:35] reference and I think a lot of people
[12:37] outside of Bitcoin they aren't even
[12:40] aware that there was a time where there
[12:44] weren't fiat currencies because nobody
[12:46] learns about money. Nobody learns about
[12:48] anything of that. That's why we are so
[12:50] early because even the few people that
[12:52] have Bitcoin don't understand it really.
[12:54] So there only a few uh select people
[12:57] that that kind of get it like maybe it's
[12:59] 100 thousand people, maybe it's like
[13:00] half a million people. I don't know how
[13:02] what the number is, but it's not a lot
[13:03] of people. It's like you you you can
[13:06] probably fit them in a huge stadium,
[13:08] right? It is. And and you know, I was I
[13:10] was looking it up and I was I was
[13:11] looking at like the amount of how many
[13:13] different fiat currencies we we
[13:14] currently have like 180ish different
[13:17] fiat currencies right now. And then I
[13:19] was looking at like how many different
[13:21] forms of money we've had in the past.
[13:24] And that number is like anywhere from
[13:26] like 600 to like thousands of different
[13:29] forms of money. I mean depending on how
[13:32] you classify money or like fiat like
[13:34] money like that. It's like it's insane
[13:36] to think that we've had so many
[13:38] different forms. It's it's not just
[13:40] because we all know dollars. So we all
[13:42] know just you know the US dollar and
[13:44] whatever country you you're in but we
[13:46] don't think about other things that were
[13:48] used. So I think I think that's a good
[13:50] starting point to like understand why
[13:53] Bitcoin matters and why and and starting
[13:55] to understand the properties of money
[13:56] and why these other currencies failed.
[13:59] 100% and that's why we it's also so
[14:01] important that we have as many people as
[14:04] possible evangelizing for that
[14:07] technology because a lot of people don't
[14:09] understand it and if you are on the
[14:12] Titanic and uh you see that the iceberg
[14:15] is coming will you take your family with
[14:17] you on the savings boat or will you keep
[14:21] them left behind?
 Right. Right. If if
[14:24] you want to keep your family left
[14:26] behind, there's something wrong with
[14:28] you.
 Yep. Yep. Yep.
 You better orange
[14:31] pill your family. You better orange bill
[14:33] your partner. You better orange bill
[14:35] your loved ones. And even if they even
[14:38] if they don't want to get orange build,
[14:41] keep keep nagging at it. Don't don't be
[14:44] the the don't be an [ __ ] to them, but
[14:47] like uh every now and then just bring
[14:49] some small Bitcoin information out
[14:51] there. And I I'm telling you, like just
[14:54] being that one Bitcoiner guy in the
[14:56] family allows you to answer questions
[14:58] because people come up with questions.
[15:00] They're like, "Hey, like how is that
[15:02] with Bitcoin?" And then you answer the
[15:04] question and that's it. You don't have
[15:05] to be offensive, aggressive or or
[15:07] anything like that. Just be the
[15:08] educator, the the the one that answers
[15:11] question about Bitcoin in the family. I
[15:12] think that's our responsibility in that
[15:15] information war that we are currently
[15:17] in.
 Yeah. Oh yeah. I'm I'm the annoying
[15:19] guy. I always I mean they they know I'm
[15:21] going to bring this this thing up
[15:23] eventually during the conversation I'm
[15:25] going to bring it or some something I'm
[15:27] going to mention it for sure. Um how
[15:28] how's your your family with all of this?
[15:30] I'm guessing that since you've been
[15:31] doing this for a while your family is
[15:33] probably orange pill but am I am I wrong
[15:35] about this? Is your family still kind of
[15:37] like questioning it or
 Yeah. Orange bill
[15:40] they have Bitcoin. It depends on on
[15:42] because I have a huge family and
[15:43] honestly I've uh like my my my close
[15:47] family like I have mom, dad, sister like
[15:50] just like three people but if you go out
[15:51] with aunts and uncles and cousins like
[15:54] there's a huge family my my my
[15:56] grandparents were where they they put a
[15:59] lot a lot of efforts in into making a
[16:01] lot of kids. So that's why we have now a
[16:03] lot of cousins and uncles and aunts and
[16:04] stuff like that. So, um I I saw
[16:09] something interesting and there's like
[16:11] the closer you come to the sun, the
[16:13] hotter it gets. And the the the for me
[16:18] it's also the same thing. The the closer
[16:20] the people are to me, the more they get
[16:23] Bitcoin. So, the the cousins, the uncles
[16:26] that that have the the that spend the
[16:29] most time with me get Bitcoin the most.
[16:32] like obviously my my my partner, my my
[16:36] girlfriend, uh my uh mom, my dad, my
[16:39] sister, her friend, my one one of two of
[16:43] my cousins that really get it. So the
[16:46] the closer people get to me, the higher
[16:49] chance they actually have to
[16:51] understanding Bitcoin. And that's why I
[16:52] said it's so important to be that
[16:54] Bitcoiner guy. And it will pay off
[16:58] dramatically. If you are that one
[17:00] bitcoin aer guy in the family and you
[17:03] are always being like okay this bitcoin
[17:06] this bitcoin this they will look back in
[17:08] 10 20 years like he was he was right
[17:12] about bitcoin. What else he's right
[17:15] about? What what else will he find? Like
[17:18] this is a reputation reputation play.
[17:21] Um, if you if you if you don't tell
[17:24] anyone about Bitcoin and they will find
[17:27] out later that you have a lot of
[17:28] Bitcoin, they will be mad at you. Why
[17:31] didn't you tell them? So, make sure to
[17:34] tell them so they are not mad at you in
[17:36] 10 years.
 Yeah, exactly. No, I agree. I
[17:38] agree. I feel like, and also the other
[17:40] thing that um that is um that I realized
[17:43] too, it's like it's not it's not like
[17:46] it's not fun to just be the only person
[17:49] that is wealthy. Like not that I'm
[17:52] wealthy right now, but like in the
[17:54] future, like if if it's just you that
[17:56] has the Bitcoin and everybody everybody
[17:58] else around you is just poor, then how
[18:01] can you be happy? You know what I'm
[18:03] saying? Cuz then you're going to spend
[18:04] your entire the rest of your life just
[18:05] trying to help out the rest of your
[18:06] family. If you are if you know that
[18:09] Bitcoin is a solution and you trying to
[18:11] help everybody else and everybody else
[18:13] is on the same page and the entire
[18:15] family grows together then you know it's
[18:18] like it's a you know it's an amazing
[18:20] thing and and and not just family
[18:21] actually like you know family, friends,
[18:23] community like it's like spread the the
[18:26] love to as many people as possible like
[18:29] cuz it's not like I'm getting paid for
[18:31] this like this is something that I enjoy
[18:33] doing just because I'm like yo this is
[18:35] this is the right thing to do you know,
[18:37] like this is like I will do this for
[18:39] free forever. I don't care about money
[18:41] really right now. Like I'll be okay.
[18:42] I'll be able to retire like before my
[18:45] before I'm 40. So I'm I'm good, you
[18:47] know? So yeah, that's interesting.
 I
[18:48] love that spirit. I love that spirit.
[18:50] Talk to us about your um transitioning
[18:52] from like your um your job to doing the
[18:56] podcast full-time. Was that was that
[18:57] like difficult? Like what was that like
[18:59] actually?
[19:01] That was the hardest thing I have ever
[19:02] gone through probably until now at least
[19:05] because I had a job that I liked. I had
[19:07] a job that was um fulfilling in a lot of
[19:12] different ways. I liked my boss. I liked
[19:14] my colleagues. I liked the thing that I
[19:17] did. Um it was a growing uh company. It
[19:21] was a younger company around 20
[19:22] employees. uh it it had a lot of the
[19:25] things that I looked forward to and it
[19:27] is a company where I was like okay if I
[19:29] hustle in there like I I can be part of
[19:32] something bigger and uh better and this
[19:35] is something um where I saw a future in
[19:39] in this company I saw something hell I
[19:41] can be longer in that company but the
[19:44] damn thing is the damnest thing happened
[19:46] I saw that I'm not that I'm not that uh
[19:52] crazy about IT security. I'm more crazy
[19:54] about Bitcoin. And with that discovery
[19:57] that I'm more crazy about Bitcoin than
[19:59] IT security, I was like, hey, I think I
[20:02] want to do something with Bitcoin. I
[20:04] want to do something there. And yeah, I
[20:07] started doing Twitter just as my first
[20:10] uh step into the community. I was like,
[20:12] hey, let's let's do some tweets. I did
[20:14] that for a year. Uh then uh more more
[20:17] people reached out to me and I was like,
[20:19] okay, I talk with those people. I can
[20:20] record those um uh those conversations.
[20:24] And that's basically how my podcast
[20:26] started. I just recorded those
[20:28] conversations that I anyways had with
[20:29] other Bitcoiners. And after that, I had
[20:33] all of the sudden the podcast, the
[20:35] Twitter, and now sponsors reached out
[20:37] and and said like, "Hey, we want to pay
[20:38] you money so you um uh and support you."
[20:42] And I was like, "Wait, like why why do
[20:44] you want to pay me?
[20:47] I'm I'm just having a podcast. like I
[20:49] don't sell anything like yeah like we
[20:51] want to sell something with you.
[20:54] So, um, this is where I realized this
[20:58] was fe this was January. Oh gosh, I'm
[21:02] getting all of confused with the number.
[21:05] This was January 2024. So, uh, a year
[21:08] and like uh, four or five months ago.
[21:11] And this was basically the time where I
[21:13] said, do I want to do this Bitcoin thing
[21:16] or do I want to keep that feared thing
[21:19] alive or fear? I would not say it was a
[21:22] feared job. It was just IT security. It
[21:24] was not a Bitcoin job. So, do I want to
[21:28] keep stay there? I want to do this
[21:30] Bitcoin thing. Now, in hindsight, it
[21:33] looks so obvious like, oh, yeah, you
[21:34] have this podcast. You can live from it.
[21:36] You you go around the world. You you're
[21:38] speaking at conferences. I'll be
[21:40] tomorrow, I'm flying to Dublin, then day
[21:43] after. Uh then directly after that, I'm
[21:47] flying back to Vienna and then to to Las
[21:49] Vegas. And it's it's just like what a
[21:52] what what a life do I have? Like it's
[21:55] all what I dream for. So in hindsight,
[21:58] it looks so obvious. But it just wasn't
[22:01] obvious a year ago. It just wasn't. And
[22:05] back then was, hey, I can go in this
[22:10] bigger risky thing where I don't have
[22:12] any securities. I don't have any like
[22:15] long-term contracts. Even the first
[22:17] sponsor that reached out to me and said
[22:19] like hey we want to give you money. It
[22:21] was just a temporary thing. It was just
[22:22] like hey let's try it out months and
[22:24] let's see what happens. So worst case
[22:27] I'm after 3 months with no income and
[22:31] nothing and I just quit my job. So so
[22:33] that like worst case situation. Um, and
[22:38] I remember myself that
[22:42] I am,
[22:44] how do I put this?
[22:47] There was a speech that I listened to
[22:49] from from Jim Kerry and he basically
[22:51] said and it resonated
[22:54] um it resonated deeply with me and I I
[22:56] will I'll butcher it probably but he
[22:59] said if you you can you can you can get
[23:03] fired at a job that you're good at that
[23:07] you don't like. So, you might as well
[23:10] just take the chance and uh try a job
[23:13] that you're good at and you like because
[23:17] even if you take the conservative even
[23:19] if you get take the conservative route,
[23:21] you can also fail. You can also get
[23:23] fired. You can also like things
[23:26] happening
[23:28] if you have that risk of losing your
[23:30] job. Anyways, if you have the risk of
[23:33] losing your company if you're an
[23:35] entrepreneur uh and all those things, if
[23:38] you have that risk anyways, why not have
[23:41] this risk in something you really enjoy?
[23:43] Then my problem was I really enjoyed
[23:45] also the other thing. It was just not as
[23:47] good as as the Bitcoin thing. And uh the
[23:51] final thing that really tipped me over
[23:52] the edge was I I guess Jeff Booof. Jeff
[23:56] Boo was really uh very influential in or
[23:59] impactful in in in that journey of mine
[24:02] because he said on my podcast and I was
[24:04] working full-time when I had Jeff Boo on
[24:06] my podcast. Uh he he said to me um when
[24:10] you are all in with your money in in
[24:13] Bitcoin,
[24:15] why are you still giving the old system
[24:18] your power, your time? Why are you not
[24:22] giving that to to Bitcoin? And he did
[24:25] not say that to me.
[24:27] He asked that himself when he was all in
[24:29] Bitcoin but still had his time and his
[24:32] funds in the fiat world. And then he
[24:34] shifted everything with ego defe capital
[24:36] of Bitcoin. And then I was like, okay,
[24:38] he it makes a lot of sense. And then it
[24:41] this was just like one day where like I
[24:44] guess I have to quit my job.
 Damn,
[24:47] that's deep, man. That's deep. Holy
[24:49] crap. I I I have to think about those
[24:53] cuz those are two pretty like awesome
[24:55] quotes from two different people,
[24:56] honestly. It's like, you know, the gym
[24:58] career things is is is pretty like, you
[25:00] know, I mean, I can't really I mean, you
[25:02] do you only have you only have one life.
[25:04] And, you know, he's right like if you're
[25:06] going to um if you can get fired easily.
[25:09] I mean, even myself as a nurse, I mean,
[25:11] if I make one bad mistake, there I go.
[25:14] I'm gone. And yeah, and the and Jeff
[25:17] Boof also, you know, he's he's very
[25:19] inspiring. And yeah, it's the thing is
[25:22] it's like it's so hard to like take that
[25:24] leap of faith, you know. It's like like
[25:26] like you say, it's like that initial
[25:29] step is kind of like it's so hard to
[25:32] like it cuz you don't because I think
[25:34] it's the uncertainty. You like what if
[25:37] what if what if what if what if this
[25:38] doesn't work out? What if this doesn't
[25:40] work out? And you're like, oh my god.
[25:41] Like I don't know. So, huh.
 I I I found
[25:44] I found a quote uh quickly from Jim
[25:46] Carrey and and the exact quote and I
[25:49] love it so much. It really gives me
[25:51] goosebumps just like thinking it back at
[25:53] that time.
 Yeah. He said, "You can fail
[25:56] at what you don't want, so you might as
[25:58] well take the chance on doing what you
[25:59] love."
 Damn. I like that. That needs to
[26:03] be on a shirt. That That's That's That's
[26:04] That's pretty good. That needs That
[26:07] That's pretty good. Wow. Wow. Wow. Wow.
[26:09] Okay.
 I'm pretty sure that there are a
[26:12] lot of shirts out there if you want to
[26:13] buy.
[26:15] Yeah, man. Now, you know what? Now, that
[26:17] got me thinking, man. You know, it's
[26:19] crazy because, you know, now now you got
[26:22] me thinking about quitting my job.
[26:25] I hope my watch you you have one podcast
[26:29] with Robin and and all of the stuff you
[26:31] want to quit your job, right?
 I'm just
[26:33] I'm just going to blame you, man.
[26:36] I'm just going to be like, "Yeah, Robin
[26:37] Robin told me to quit my job. No big
[26:39] deal. It's all right.
 Who the heck
[26:40] Robin?"
[26:43] The first time I ever made any money, I
[26:45] got myself from that money a watch. And
[26:47] ever since then, I collect time pieces
[26:50] to remember times where I achieved some
[26:53] milestone. That's why I got the Bitcoin
[26:56] 2025 edition when I went to my first
[26:58] ever American Bitcoin conference. So for
[27:01] me, the Bitcoin watches from Coin Villan
[27:04] represents the time that we are living
[27:06] in. For every person that wears a
[27:08] Bitcoin watch, I know they are
[27:11] representing sound money to the outside
[27:14] world. Make sure to check out those
[27:16] amazing coin vigilante time pieces down
[27:20] in the descriptions. I love those
[27:21] watches so so much. Most people realize
[27:25] that way way way too late. If you have
[27:28] Bitcoin, you have to have a self-custody
[27:31] hardware wallet. But what are you doing
[27:33] if that hardware wallet breaks? Yeah,
[27:34] you wrote your seed phrase on paper.
[27:38] What if that paper is just dissolving or
[27:41] water spilled on top of it? paper is
[27:43] very very non-durable. So you have to
[27:46] have a fire resistant, water resistant
[27:49] and impact proof method of securing your
[27:52] seat phrase so you can back up your
[27:55] keys. And to do that you should use a
[27:57] solid titanium plate from stamp seed. Go
[28:01] to stampseed.com
[28:03] and use code robin to get not five or 10
[28:07] but 15% off your stamp seed. The most
[28:12] important thing for your Bitcoin journey
[28:14] is not buying Bitcoin, but it's how to
[28:17] keep them. And yes, you have maybe the
[28:19] right tools, but how do you actually go
[28:21] ahead and stick it all together so it's
[28:24] the most secure for you personally?
[28:27] Self- custody is a deeply personalized
[28:29] journey and the Bitcoin way is helping
[28:31] you exactly finding that correct setup
[28:35] for you personally. They're also helping
[28:37] you with securing your own cyber
[28:40] security. And if you want to go one step
[28:42] above all that, you can even get a
[28:45] consultation for a plan B residency. Go
[28:49] to the bitcoinway.com/roin
[28:53] and you will get a 30inut free
[28:56] consultation. I know how big of a hurdle
[28:58] it can be to have self-custody, but it's
[29:02] so freaking important to make that first
[29:04] step. We have to make sure it's as easy
[29:07] and simple as possible. And that's
[29:10] exactly what BitBox did. Bitbox created
[29:13] the simplest and the easiest hardware
[29:16] wallet to use to get into self custody.
[29:19] So get yourself a Bitbox down from the
[29:22] link in the description. And when you
[29:24] use code Robin, you even get a 5%
[29:27] discount.
[29:29] That's crazy. Damn. All right. All
[29:31] right. Now I got something to think
[29:32] about tonight. Jesus. Um, and talk about
[29:35] that. Do you do you ever miss it?
[29:36] Actually, do you ever miss your old job?
[29:40] There is there's something really
[29:42] interesting happening when you being on
[29:45] your own when you do when you are
[29:47] self-employed because there's nobody
[29:49] like
 you don't have investors you don't
[29:52] have employees you don't have a boss you
[29:54] don't have uh helpers you you don't
[29:57] you're completely on your own and it's
[29:59] it's freaking lonely and I think uh not
[30:02] enough people talk about that and not
[30:04] enough people especially in the
[30:06] beginning it's sometimes hard to cope
[30:08] with It's like, oh yeah, you you you
[30:10] stand up, your girlfriend is also at
[30:13] work, so she's also not there. You have
[30:15] the whole day, and you're just trying to
[30:18] figure everything out. The the social
[30:22] insurance wants the first payments. The
[30:24] the finance minister wants the first
[30:26] payments. Uh the the sponsors don't want
[30:29] to pay as much as you want. Uh or as you
[30:33] as you need. Then the podcast sometimes
[30:36] has also ups and downs. Sometimes the
[30:38] fus are down, sometimes the fuse are up.
[30:40] It's It's freaking lonely and it's I I
[30:43] understand why not a lot of people do
[30:45] it. The stomach you need, the mental
[30:48] toughness you need to do something on
[30:50] your own and to power through no matter
[30:53] what, most people quit. Most people just
[30:58] go back to safety, just go back to to
[31:01] the convenient way. So it's it's it's
[31:04] about making that hard choice and
[31:06] powering through that that that enables
[31:09] the easy life that it enables the good
[31:12] life. If if you're it's like hard
[31:14] choices, easy life, easy choices, hard
[31:17] life. That that that's the thing that
[31:19] that I've came to know that's so so
[31:22] true. And for me in the beginning it was
[31:26] really hard and I missed being an
[31:29] employee at a company where I don't have
[31:32] to worry about anything. There's like
[31:37] just a boss coming. He gives me tasks.
[31:39] I'm responsible for that. If I [ __ ] it
[31:41] up, there's a boss that is responsible
[31:43] for that. It's not me. I'm still
[31:46] responsible. I if I do a bad job over
[31:49] and over again, I probably get fired.
[31:52] But um if I if I miss once, it's not
[31:56] that bad. So there's always a safety net
[31:59] there. If I go on holidays, there's
[32:01] someone else covering for me and I get
[32:04] paid in the holiday the same as I'm not
[32:06] on holiday. I don't know if it's in
[32:08] America the same, but like in Austria
[32:10] like paid holidays and everything like
[32:11] that. So you get like five weeks of of
[32:14] paid holiday a year. Then um what if
[32:18] you're what if you're sick? You still
[32:21] get paid.
[32:22] You as an employee, you can be sick.
[32:26] If you're self-employed, if you're sick,
[32:29] nothing is happening.
[32:31] You either have to work and you're
[32:33] missing out on potential to earn on
[32:37] potential to think. So like the starting
[32:39] point is super hard and was super
[32:42] challenging for me and was a really hard
[32:47] part in my life that really I learned so
[32:50] much in that small region of my life and
[32:54] overall I can say in the last one and a
[32:56] half years I learned more than in the
[32:58] previous 15 years in my life just
[33:01] because I went through all the things
[33:03] like you listen to podcast and you
[33:05] listen to entrepreneur podcast and
[33:07] business podcast and you're like, "Ah, I
[33:08] know those things. I can do this." No,
[33:11] you don't.
[33:13] You never did it. You have no clue how
[33:15] hard it really is. And the thing is, I
[33:17] still now listen to business podcast and
[33:19] entrepreneurial things. Now I understand
[33:22] the things actually. I I hear the same
[33:26] thing now than I than I heard two years
[33:28] ago and now it makes sense for me. And
[33:31] that's the whole it's so so I just want
[33:35] to give because maybe it's not just you.
[33:37] Maybe there's someone else out there and
[33:39] and it's like oh I quit my job tomorrow.
[33:42] I don't know. Uh and I I just want to
[33:45] say it's you you quit your 9 to5 for a
[33:50] 247 job. That that's basically what
[33:53] you're doing. You it's all about like oh
[33:56] I want to set my own time. No you don't.
[33:58] Like if you set your own time you work
[34:00] on Christmas. You work on east, you you
[34:03] work 247
[34:05] and you will wake up at 2:00 a.m. in the
[34:08] morning because oh [ __ ] I have to make
[34:11] that payment. Oh [ __ ] I didn't do that.
[34:15] Oh [ __ ] Like like that's a real thing
[34:19] that a lot of people don't want to hear.
[34:21] A real thing that a lot of people ignore
[34:24] or or think, oh no, I will be better.
[34:27] No, I I I I will not I will not do that.
[34:30] So, but yeah, has has little to no
[34:32] nothing to do with Bitcoin, but uh I
[34:35] think it's an it's important message for
[34:36] everyone. Um, it's it's it it's for most
[34:41] people it's best to keep doing what
[34:45] you're good at at your current job and
[34:48] stacking as much Bitcoin as possible
[34:50] because I guarantee you that if you not
[34:53] quit your job and you basically trade in
[34:58] the safety job that you had maybe for
[35:00] 10, 20, 30 years and you get into this
[35:03] adventure,
[35:05] you probably have to spend some of your
[35:07] stack. You probably are not stacking as
[35:09] good as possible. There there's a lot of
[35:12] complications coming your way that you
[35:14] have no clue how to deal with, but
[35:16] there's nobody to help you except maybe
[35:19] some some YouTubers that might have an
[35:21] answer, but it's highly in individual
[35:24] also. Yeah.
 Yeah. Yeah. No, I agree.
[35:26] It's like the the comfort part is
[35:28] actually interesting, too. Um because
[35:30] because honestly the only reason why I'm
[35:31] doing this because um I have like like
[35:35] I'm still working I'm working two days a
[35:37] week. I the the beautiful thing is I can
[35:39] afford to just work two two nights a
[35:40] week and then I can have five days also
[35:42] that during that five days I can
[35:44] actually focus on trying to grow this
[35:46] and you know it's it's it's amazing
[35:49] because I've never had this before until
[35:51] until I um you know lowered my expenses
[35:54] you know like I knew I understood what
[35:57] money was and decrease like um decrease
[36:00] all my you know high interest bills and
[36:02] refinance everything and now I feel like
[36:04] I feel free now. But um you know the
[36:08] other thing I wanted to say about um the
[36:10] comfort part. I don't know if you ever
[36:11] heard a story I wish I could remember
[36:13] the story word for it. spot like the the
[36:15] frog a frog thing where it's like the
[36:19] like bunch of students they put a frog
[36:20] in a in a water and then the frog was
[36:23] jumping around and then the they started
[36:26] to like crank the temperature up and and
[36:29] as the temperature got hotter and
[36:31] hotter, the frog got like calmer and
[36:34] calmer because frogs love like warm um
[36:38] like warm temperatures. And then
[36:41] eventually the the frog got extremely
[36:44] comfortable because the water was, you
[36:46] know, was warm. And then over time the
[36:49] frog the and and then at the end the
[36:50] frog eventually died because the water
[36:53] was just too hot and the frog died from
[36:56] basically being too comfortable from
[36:59] from its comfort. So I guess I don't
[37:00] know if I said that story, you know, in
[37:03] the proper way, but like the the the
[37:05] moral of that story was like if you're
[37:07] too comfortable, you know, that could
[37:10] also be bad for you. So don't just stay
[37:13] comfortable. You kind of have to take
[37:15] some risk in life in order to achieve
[37:17] what you want. So I don't know if that
[37:19] made sense or not.
[37:20] It's uh it's it's interesting because
[37:24] I've actually also looked at that uh
[37:27] that thing and it's it's not entirely
[37:30] true actually and and it it is something
[37:33] that we we hear so much that that that
[37:38] story and I I I believe it even used it
[37:42] in the past but then some guest of mine
[37:44] said like oh that story is actually not
[37:45] true and I looked it up and like oh [ __ ]
[37:48] there's because um most frogs and they
[37:52] have done multiple studies on that. Um
[37:54] and and there are some instances where
[37:56] frogs don't uh jump out but there are
[37:59] some instances where jumps where they
[38:01] actually try to escape. There's some
[38:03] some instance where if it gets so hot it
[38:07] gets hard on them and then they actually
[38:08] trying to escape and just can happen
[38:11] that in that instant there also some
[38:14] some some failure of heart like failure
[38:17] of the body and stuff like that. So um
[38:19] but mo in in the literal sense if you
[38:22] just put a frog in a a boiling water uh
[38:25] or like in normal water and you slowly
[38:27] crank the temperature up they most
[38:29] likely jump out uh or trying to escape
[38:33] maybe they cannot because they have some
[38:34] body failures. So um it's super
[38:37] interesting because I bring the same
[38:39] example up with fear. I think that um
[38:42] there's a lot of people saying like,
[38:43] "Oh, like there's like inflation and uh
[38:45] we just crank up the inflation a little
[38:47] bit, a little bit, and people don't
[38:48] notice."
 Yeah, that's true. If you keep
[38:51] inflation actually at 2%. People
[38:53] probably will not notice that much. But
[38:55] the thing is you cannot keep the
[38:57] inflation at 2%. Because the interest
[38:59] rates has to be paid and uh at some
[39:02] point it's 3% and some point there's 4%
[39:04] and there's always a reason to print
[39:06] more money. We saw it in COVID. A lot of
[39:08] reasons to print more money and those
[39:11] things will come again and again and
[39:13] again as Larry Larry Larry Laaz says the
[39:17] big print is coming and that's 100%
[39:19] true. So we will cranking up the
[39:22] temperature but with the feared system
[39:24] it's interesting because the temperature
[39:26] will be cranked up faster and faster and
[39:29] faster. So we don't have that slow
[39:32] smooth transition and in that way the
[39:35] frog in that way in in that sense the
[39:39] citizen that has the money in the fiat
[39:42] currency he will jump out and he will
[39:44] get the bitcoin because it gets too hot
[39:48] the the it they will escape from a
[39:52] system that is being bad to them and we
[39:55] see that in Turkey we see that in
[39:56] Argentina we see that in so many
[39:57] different places where people have
[40:00] hyperinflation and all of the sudden
[40:03] they are actually opting out of that
[40:05] system and they're going to gold.
[40:07] They're going to a US dollar because
[40:09] it's a better fiat currencies than they
[40:10] own have they opting out of that system.
[40:13] They know it's not a it's not a good
[40:15] money and even if they don't opt out
[40:17] they are uh trying to buy things from
[40:20] that uh from that money as soon as they
[40:23] got the salary. they get the salary and
[40:25] directly go to the supermarket and buy
[40:27] like a month's worth of toilet paper.
[40:31] Weird example, but um so the boiling
[40:35] water of fiat will get to a temperature
[40:38] where everyone is just escaping from it.
[40:41] Now with US dollar, with euro and with
[40:43] some other currencies, it's not as
[40:44] boiling as it could be. So people are
[40:47] still comfortable. They're still
[40:48] enjoying the warm bath. It's like nice.
[40:51] It's comfortable. There's some bubbles
[40:53] going on. and there's music in the
[40:54] background, there's like a TV in front
[40:56] of you. It's a nice warm bath, but I
[40:59] guarantee you that the central banks are
[41:01] cranking the temperature up and you will
[41:03] uh you better get out before your body
[41:07] is failing. So with uh that's kind of
[41:10] the the frog analogy there where some of
[41:12] people might not get out early enough
[41:15] because they ignore the hot temperature
[41:19] and then their body and the heart is
[41:21] maybe failing before they cannot get
[41:23] out. They missed the point of exit.
[41:26] And uh I hope uh I can I can get as many
[41:31] people as as I can out of the water and
[41:35] into the safness and then try their hair
[41:38] and stuff.
 Yeah, that is actually
[41:40] interesting. You know what? This is that
[41:42] was a that was actually a great like
[41:44] example switching the that frog story to
[41:47] the fiat thing. Actually, that was that
[41:49] was interesting. I'm going to we we're
[41:51] going to have to like write a little
[41:52] story about that. a little a little mini
[41:54] book about the frog instead of the the
[41:56] water thing. Okay. I I actually like
[41:58] that a lot. And um do you remember which
[42:00] guest actually said that by any chance
[42:02] or
 Yeah, I
[42:06] somebody said it. Yeah, that's that's a
[42:09] bad thing because I'm currently uh in
[42:11] the in the works of writing a book and
[42:13] uh it's it's so hard for me like oh I I
[42:17] know I know that who said that because I
[42:20] want to credit them somehow and I
[42:22] probably will just write something like
[42:24] everything in this book I learned from
[42:26] my podcast guests. I just don't know who
[42:30] said what.
 Unless you like you have the
[42:33] time to like go through every single one
[42:35] of your podcast again, but that would
[42:36] take forever. But yeah. Oh wow. That is
[42:39] crazy. Um and and then and then other
[42:41] than that like from like interviewing
[42:43] all your guests like what would I mean I
[42:45] know this is going to be maybe a little
[42:47] bit tougher question but like what would
[42:48] you say are like three main messages,
[42:52] three main things that you've learned
[42:53] from them so far? Ah, I I I it's not a
[42:57] tough question. I love that question
[42:58] because I actually have three things
[43:00] that I learned from from the podcast.
[43:03] The first is Bitcoin is not money.
[43:07] Bitcoin is not an investment. Bitcoin is
[43:09] not a savings. Bitcoin is a paradigm
[43:12] shift. It's a foundational I actually
[43:15] had that that discussion right to do
[43:17] today. It's actually something that I've
[43:19] learned today. Um, Bitcoin is a
[43:22] foundational invention. There are
[43:25] foundational inventions that are perfect
[43:27] from the inception. So let's take the
[43:30] wheel for example. The wheel was perfect
[43:33] from the inception. It was it was a
[43:36] wheel and it it's spinning. It's so
[43:39] simple and it's it's amazing. Of course,
[43:42] people will put things on the wheel and
[43:43] they will try to modify it a little bit,
[43:46] but it's still like a round thing that
[43:48] is spinning and has like an act like
[43:50] it's a wheel. You can you can you can
[43:53] name it differently. You can put
[43:54] different things on it, but it's still a
[43:56] wheel. And the same thing with other
[44:00] discoveries like the fire with uh with
[44:02] other things that we have seen in the
[44:05] history that are foundational
[44:07] inventions that are true and that are
[44:11] perfect from the inception. And Bitcoin
[44:14] is something like that. Bitcoin is an
[44:17] foundational invention, a paradigm shift
[44:21] like the printing press, the steam
[44:22] engine, electricity, the electronic
[44:25] telegraph, um AI. All of those things
[44:29] will massively shift how we think about
[44:33] money, how we interact with each other,
[44:36] and what we do in our daily life. It's
[44:39] so interesting to see how deep the
[44:44] impact of Bitcoin actually is because
[44:47] it's money. It's it's such a
[44:49] foundational thing to our human beings.
[44:53] So that's so that's the per first thing
[44:56] I've learned that Bitcoin is the new
[44:59] base layer for civilization and early
[45:03] adopters will win massively and everyone
[45:06] else kind of gets re everything else
[45:09] kind of gets repriced and and those
[45:11] people who kind of get um left behind
[45:15] and get repriced in in in what they are
[45:17] doing those will learn the hard way what
[45:21] it why not adopting an paradigm shift
[45:25] can hurt a lot. It's the same thing with
[45:28] the internet. There are people to this
[45:31] day actually that say, "Oh, the internet
[45:32] is not good."
[45:34] And there are a few people that embrace
[45:36] the internet like Jeff Bezos. He's like,
[45:39] "Hey, I want to sell books online."
[45:43] People are like, "Oh, like how how like
[45:45] who will buy a book online? I have a
[45:47] store right here. Like why would I go on
[45:49] the website? I don't even know if it's
[45:51] safe. Yeah, turns out it was a good idea
[45:54] to embrace the internet. Uh there are so
[45:58] many different examples of that. Like
[46:00] those who embrace a two new technology
[46:03] will win massively. Those who don't,
[46:06] they get repriced. They get their life
[46:09] gets repriced.
[46:12] And it's it's it's a hard thing to thing
[46:14] to to to see. And that's the first thing
[46:18] I I kind of realized when when I talked
[46:21] with now like almost 500 different uh
[46:23] guests or like 500 over 500 episodes.
[46:26] The second thing I would say is that we
[46:28] are in an information war. We as
[46:30] Bitcoiners have the responsibility
[46:34] to stand up for Bitcoin to be digital
[46:37] and offline soldiers for that
[46:39] information war that's going on. There
[46:42] are is there are different media
[46:44] outlets. There are mainstream medias.
[46:46] There is YouTube, there's Twitter,
[46:47] there's Nostra, there's all those
[46:49] different media platforms or outlets or
[46:52] whatever you want to call it. And on
[46:54] those media platforms, there are
[46:56] different voices that fight for the
[46:59] narrative. They they fight for or what
[47:02] is Bitcoin actually? Is Bitcoin a Ponzi
[47:06] scheme? Is it money? Is it an
[47:08] investment? Is a speculative asset? What
[47:10] is Bitcoin? That's a narrative that some
[47:13] people are trying to to to win in
[47:16] different uh things. So I've learned
[47:19] that it's not inevitable that Bitcoin is
[47:24] smooth sailing from here. I think
[47:26] Bitcoin the idea of Bitcoin will win out
[47:29] no matter what we as human being do.
[47:32] But the way how it gets adopted, how
[47:36] peacefully it gets adopted
[47:38] is modifiable. And if we don't fight for
[47:42] Bitcoin, we might have a very very very
[47:46] hard next 10 months, next next 10 years.
[47:49] Because the people, let's say people win
[47:53] in the governments, win in the powers of
[47:56] positions that say Bitcoin is very bad.
[47:59] They can track down Bitcoiners. They can
[48:01] track down what they're doing. They can
[48:03] really say like, "Oh, like you have to
[48:05] pay now 70% taxes. uh if you buy
[48:09] Bitcoin, we want to know everything
[48:10] about you. We don't give you any
[48:12] privacy. We gonna this will make the
[48:15] life of Bitcoin super super hard
[48:18] and we are already a little bit above
[48:20] that. So this is one thing that I've
[48:22] learned that it's important to stand up
[48:25] for what you believe and that you are
[48:27] fighting in that information war. But
[48:30] honestly,
[48:31] we are winning. We're winning really
[48:34] good. I'm amazed by how good we're
[48:37] actually winning especially in America,
[48:39] you in America. So that's that's like
[48:42] fascinating to see how the narrative has
[48:44] completely shifted. But we have to be
[48:47] careful that the narrative keeps on
[48:49] shifting in our direction because it can
[48:51] get ugly if the powers are against
[48:55] Bitcoin.
[48:56] They will not be able to fight Bitcoin
[48:59] but they might they might be able to
[49:02] fight Bitcoiners.
[49:04] That's the thing that we have to be uh
[49:07] careful of. So like that's the digital
[49:08] soldier responsibility that we all have
[49:11] and that we all should uh fight for. And
[49:14] the third thing is an obvious one. We
[49:16] are super early. I thought yeah like
[49:18] Bitcoin has a good potential. Before I
[49:21] started the podcast, I thought like,
[49:22] okay, Bitcoin is a is a bigger is a is a
[49:26] thing that gets a lot bigger. Maybe it
[49:28] gets to a million, maybe gets to 5
[49:30] million. No, like we are super early.
[49:34] Everything under$10 million US is super
[49:39] early and super cheap. We we are in
[49:44] people think just because Bitcoin was
[49:47] previously at like $1 that we are now
[49:50] late because now it's $100,000.
[49:53] That's a very stupid perspective because
[49:57] you're looking back and you're not
[50:00] seeing the future. You're just looking
[50:02] back to the back. So like back from the
[50:05] past to the to the present. You're not
[50:08] looking at the full potential of Bitcoin
[50:10] of the full potential of money. The
[50:13] money market is like 400 500 trillion
[50:16] US. Bitcoin is what? $2 trillion.
 $2
[50:19] trillion. Yeah. Yep.
 That's a 200x
[50:23] from here. Just the money market. Then
[50:27] maybe get a monetary premium from store
[50:29] of values like real estate, gold, and
[50:32] other things. Bitcoin will be so huge
[50:36] that we can't even we cannot even fathom
[50:40] and then on top of that we getting more
[50:43] productive
[50:44] and with that the purchasing power of
[50:46] the same Bitcoin is getting up
[50:48] additionally to that and then maybe we
[50:51] discover other planets and it gets even
[50:53] bigger and stuff like that. So like
[50:55] Bitcoin has at least a 200x from here.
[51:00] Like that's the minimum in today's
[51:03] purchasing power without inflation. If
[51:06] you factor in inflation, you can I don't
[51:08] know quadruple that. But without
[51:10] inflation, in today's dollar terms, we
[51:13] are having a 200x from here. We are
[51:15] super early. Nobody knows about Bitcoin.
[51:18] If you think we're not early, go out on
[51:20] the street and ask 200 people, "What is
[51:25] Bitcoin?"
 Yep. None of them will do
[51:28] anything.
 None of them will have a good
[51:30] answer. If you're lucky, maybe one guy
[51:34] you may maybe one guy is like, "Yeah, I
[51:36] know Bitcoin.
[51:38] Oh, yeah. It's crypto. It's crypto. I
[51:39] lost money in it."
 And and it's
[51:42] fascinating how how people don't get how
[51:45] early we are. And I'm putting tweets out
[51:47] like, "Oh, 0.1 Bitcoin will be
[51:49] generational wealth." And and and even
[51:52] Bitcoiners are not bullish enough. I I I
[51:55] cannot I cannot get how Bitcoiners are
[51:58] seeing the BL seeing all those things
[52:01] and then they're like, "Yeah, maybe it
[52:03] gets to a million." No,
[52:06] you go to a million, then to 10 million,
[52:08] then to 100 million, and then to a
[52:10] thousand millions, then the US dollar
[52:12] will uh collapse and Bitcoin will be the
[52:16] only freaking asset. So, I don't know
[52:18] like I I I get randy around that topic
[52:21] like
[52:23] Bitcoin is the thing that um everyone
[52:27] including Bitcoiners are
[52:30] underestimating.
 Oh, yeah. I I like
[52:32] that. That's actually those are those
[52:33] are three. Wow. I mean I have no words
[52:36] that that that's amazing. And you know I
[52:38] agree with you cuz like you know like
[52:39] when you really look at the numbers like
[52:41] when I tell people like my price targets
[52:44] and I'm like like I don't see like it's
[52:46] literally infinity like there is no like
[52:49] dollar amount like if I have to put a
[52:52] dollar amount on it like I would say at
[52:54] least a bare minimum of $100 million
[52:57] where each satoshi is $1. Like like I
[53:00] don't see to me I don't see Bitcoin like
[53:02] I don't know like a price target to me
[53:04] is just like I don't know like it's like
[53:07] the price target is when the US dollar
[53:10] is no longer here like when everybody is
[53:12] transacting in Satoshi's that's the
[53:14] price target like the the end of fiat is
[53:17] the price target. So I feel you feel you
[53:20] u yeah crazy um but uh damn that I feel
[53:24] like that that damn Jesus Christ that
[53:26] was crazy. I'm gonna have to watch this
[53:28] part again to think about everything you
[53:30] just said because man, you just dropped
[53:32] some you just dropped some knowledge. Um
[53:34] and u I wanted to talk to you about um
[53:37] um you you live on a full fiat standard,
[53:39] right?
 Uh Bitcoin.
 No, sorry. Sorry.
[53:42] Yeah, sorry. Bitcoin stand. My bad.
[53:44] We're talking about fiat standard. My
[53:46] bad.
 I I mean I don't live on a full
[53:49] Bitcoin standard because I still have to
[53:51] pay sometimes bills in fiat. So, I still
[53:57] have to like sell Bitcoin uh to to get
[54:00] uh Bitcoin to to uh get things in fiat.
[54:04] Uh that that's a little bit annoying
[54:07] because I earn already most of my money
[54:09] in Bitcoin. So, but most of my expenses
[54:12] are still in in in fiat. So, I'm I'm
[54:14] getting to a full Bitcoin standard, but
[54:16] it's a lot of work to get there.
 I want
[54:18] to get there eventually at some point,
[54:20] but you know, it's like when nobody else
[54:22] around you is doing it, it's it's kind
[54:23] of it is pretty tough. Does the
[54:26] volatility affect
[54:28] the way that you live on a Bitcoin
[54:30] standard at all or like how does that
[54:32] work so far?
 Yeah, like my I'm getting
[54:35] wealthier every every year. It's it's
[54:38] No, it's um I I get what you're saying.
[54:41] It's when you live on a full Bitcoin
[54:44] standard, you have to deal with
[54:45] volatility. But it's it's good
[54:49] volatility. Volatility is vitality.
[54:52] Volatility is something that you want in
[54:55] in life. That's that's like if if if you
[54:58] look at the heart rate, it once it goes
[55:01] beep,
[55:02] not a good sign. You you want volatility
[55:04] in your life. You want vitality in in in
[55:07] your life. That that's life. Nothing in
[55:10] life is is stable. Nothing in life is is
[55:14] is always the same. Bitcoin is the the
[55:18] closest thing to having something stable
[55:21] in in in life basically. Um, and I am
[55:26] now at the send moment where I just get
[55:30] a little bit more Satoshi's each month.
[55:33] Whatever the whatever the equivalent of
[55:37] fee it is, it doesn't matter. I I earn
[55:41] more than I uh I I I spend at each
[55:45] month. So each month I get a little bit
[55:47] more Satoshi's.
[55:49] And yes, the Satoshi amount might get a
[55:51] little less because Bitcoin goes up or
[55:54] the Satoshi amount gets a little bit
[55:55] more because Bitcoin goes down. Who
[55:58] cares? I get more Satoshi's. I have I
[56:02] have my Bitcoin stack from what I don't
[56:05] spend. Then I have my Bitcoin stack from
[56:07] what I spend. This is like the short
[56:08] term. what comes in and comes out and I
[56:11] get a little bit more satia each month
[56:13] like that.
 Whether the price goes up or
[56:16] down, it doesn't matter. You you
[56:18] winning. No, I like that. I like that.
[56:20] And um uh I wanted to ask you um for the
[56:24] new people out there that are going to
[56:25] be watching this podcast like what are
[56:27] some like some great resources that you
[56:29] would recommend for them to like start
[56:32] to like that are kind of easy, beginner
[56:34] friendly to start learning about
[56:35] Bitcoin? I sorry I just see that my
[56:38] camera is not focusing.
 Yeah, it's
[56:41] getting there. Yeah, there you go.
 Yeah.
[56:43] So, um uh what I recommend is uh uh not
[56:47] my podcast.
[56:49] [Music]
[56:51] Um I I think you have to take an
[56:55] individual approach. It's
[56:58] Bitcoin is a like there are so many
[57:01] different ways to explain Bitcoin.
[57:02] There's so many there will be people
[57:05] watching this podcast and saying like,
[57:07] "Oh, it does not make sense what Robin
[57:09] is saying." If you if you give that
[57:11] podcast now, like this episode to Normy
[57:14] and he's like, "Oh, uh, okay. This does
[57:18] not make sense." But maybe someone else
[57:20] that is also um a precoiner
[57:24] that that hears it and it's like, "Oh,
[57:26] yeah, that makes sense. Interesting how
[57:28] how he explained that. Let let me let me
[57:30] see that closer. Let me uh dive a little
[57:33] bit deeper in that. So, everyone needs a
[57:36] little bit of a different
[57:38] uh perspective and lens. And there are
[57:40] some people that really love Marella.
[57:42] There are some people that really love
[57:44] maybe some some software engineers that
[57:46] that explain it on a on a deep level.
[57:48] Maybe some some is like, oh, like I I
[57:50] love Papaet because I like the Bitcoin
[57:52] mining aspect. So we I I'm I'm highly I
[57:57] don't want to recommend like this one
[57:59] thing that that rules it all because I
[58:01] don't think there there is something
[58:02] like that. But what I will say is there
[58:05] are some classics. Uh we mentioned
[58:06] already the Bitcoin standard from
[58:08] Siphon. This is a real classic that I
[58:11] think most Bitcoiners should at least
[58:14] read or like at least get a summary of
[58:16] it like at least ask uh Chad GBD of like
[58:20] what what is covered there. Um but like
[58:22] if you can manage uh read it. It's a
[58:25] really good book. And uh then just like
[58:28] like see different uh podcast, see
[58:31] different people. Don't don't just get
[58:34] get it from one person. So see as many
[58:37] different persons as as possible. You
[58:40] don't have to be as as as wild as me
[58:42] with like 500 different, but maybe get
[58:44] like 100, maybe like 50 different
[58:46] people. also depends on how deep you
[58:48] want to go into the Bitcoin rabbit hole
[58:50] and community. Uh do you just want to
[58:52] see that it's your money? Like it it's
[58:55] probably enough to spend like a hundred
[58:56] or thousand hours in in that rabbit hole
[59:00] and then you see oh it's money and and
[59:01] then you can move on and do whatever you
[59:03] want to do. But some people just want to
[59:05] go deeper and deeper and deeper and
[59:07] deeper and and that that's that's yeah
[59:10] so I think if there's one resource I
[59:12] would go with the Bitcoin standard
[59:14] because it's an allrounder but it's also
[59:16] sometimes hard for someone that for the
[59:20] first time ever hears about Bitcoin.
[59:21] It's it's not there's some pretty
[59:24] advanced uh stuff in there that where
[59:26] you might say like oh okay that's that's
[59:29] too much.
 Yeah you know I agree. I
[59:31] agree. Yeah. Yeah. It's it's like the
[59:32] same thing with me. I feel like uh I
[59:34] feel like I'm like once once I I
[59:37] understood
[59:38] kind of what Bitcoin was and then like I
[59:40] didn't like I feel like a lot of
[59:41] Bitcoiners they dive into the technology
[59:43] and learn a lot more about like you know
[59:45] dive into the the mining aspect and all
[59:47] that and then meanwhile me over here I'm
[59:49] like the part of Bitcoin that interests
[59:51] me the most is how it affects health and
[59:53] diet and like that's the area that I I'm
[59:55] actually more focused on and like have
[59:58] you ever read the book uh fiat food?
[60:01] And I haven't read it actually, but I
[60:04] interviewed uh Matthew Lucia, I think
[60:08] the author of the Fiat food together
[60:10] with with Ciphedine. So I've I've dove
[60:14] in in this a little bit, but I actually
[60:16] didn't read the book.
 Oh yeah, that that
[60:18] one I I'm I'm going to read it a second
[60:20] time because I'm like, "Wow, this was
[60:22] fascinating." And I'm like trying to
[60:24] like like fact check everything again.
[60:26] And I'm trying to like doing the same
[60:28] thing that I did with the the the the
[60:30] Bitcoin centered with the fiat food cuz
[60:32] I'm like wow if this is true like like
[60:36] it almost feels like we've been poisoned
[60:38] our whole life like it just feels like
[60:40] the whole like um our like the entire
[60:44] like um what is it like the the the food
[60:47] system I mean I don't know about where
[60:49] you live like but in America at least
[60:51] this is this is like it's like it just
[60:54] mindblowing to see like how corrupt fiat
[60:58] made our like like dietary and
[61:02] pharmaceutical and all that all these
[61:04] industries are just like I don't know
[61:06] man it's it's too much like it's just so
[61:08] much information
 it's actually a lot
[61:10] better in Europe it's like one of the
[61:14] few things that is is is good about
[61:17] restrictive uh restrictive governments
[61:20] we have really hard rules on what can be
[61:24] in the food and whatnot. And I've heard
[61:27] a lot of Americans even talking about
[61:28] that that are big in health comparing
[61:31] the European diet to American diet. And
[61:35] there's a lot of studies on like how
[61:36] many people are obese in in Europe and
[61:39] how many people are obese in America.
[61:41] And the numbers are very clear that
[61:43] Europe is the is really leading there.
[61:45] Um because we have a lot of things like
[61:48] we're really big on whole foods don't
[61:51] not a processed foods. We want to eat
[61:53] full things. uh we are not we we we we
[61:57] avoid a lot of chemical things poison
[62:00] basically that cannot come in our food
[62:04] that is allowed in America and because
[62:06] of uh it's cheaper with that and and
[62:09] longerh
[62:10] can longer do with that they just add it
[62:13] which is really bad for the health and
[62:15] and for the body so that is one area
[62:18] where actually I really like European
[62:20] food uh when when I'm here I even like
[62:23] It's funny. I I even see the quality of
[62:28] McDonald's and um Subway, those American
[62:32] brands.
[62:34] I ate them uh all my life here now in in
[62:38] in Austria in in in Europe. And I was
[62:41] really excited to to try it in America
[62:44] because America is the original like
[62:45] where McDonald's is from and where
[62:47] Subway is from.
 And it tastes like [ __ ]
[62:52] [Music]
[62:53] Damn.
 Because like in in Austria,
[62:55] McDonald's, you get burgers with the
[62:58] where the beef is from Austria and it's
[63:01] it's actually good quality meat. It's
[63:04] not it's like not making advertisement
[63:06] for McDonald's for Austrians. It's it's
[63:09] still a bad food, but compared to the
[63:12] one in America, it's like, oh, that that
[63:14] tastes [ __ ] Like that it's it's not
[63:17] good. It's it's not good for your
[63:18] health. It's not even tasty at all. So,
[63:22] um, uh, and I, and I think I I only have
[63:26] one reference. It was like Miami City
[63:28] where I was at a Subway and at a
[63:29] McDonald's, and it was just like, it was
[63:32] just not good.
 That's crazy. You know, I
[63:37] I haven't been to Europe yet, but I
[63:39] would love to try some European food,
[63:40] man, to see how how different it is. Cuz
[63:42] cuz yeah, I was reading too like you
[63:44] guys you guys do there are a lot of like
[63:46] different chemicals that you you guys
[63:48] are not you guys don't allow in your
[63:50] food that America's like oh yeah you can
[63:52] put it in there you know like cuz even
[63:53] my wife and I sometimes when we go
[63:55] grocery shopping now the thing that I'm
[63:57] that I started doing now I started
[63:59] looking at the ingredients and like
[64:00] sometimes in the like the little packet
[64:02] you know at the bottom in the small
[64:04] prints they literally in fine print says
[64:07] this may contain something that can
[64:10] cause cancer. and if you're pregnant, it
[64:13] will cause brain damage in your child.
[64:15] And it literally says it word for word.
[64:18] So, it's like, why are you selling that?
[64:20] Why you why are you selling that crap if
[64:22] it's not like I don't I don't get it.
[64:24] Like, like why are you purposefully
[64:27] poisoning your citizens? Oh, well,
[64:30] before I let you go, actually, um other
[64:32] uh the other than the number grow up
[64:34] technology, how else has Bitcoin changed
[64:37] you so far?
[64:40] Uh I mean I'm a special case because I'm
[64:42] working in Bitcoin and I'm my whole life
[64:44] is uh evolved around Bitcoin and I I I
[64:49] want to bring up one example um but it's
[64:52] that's financially related but it I
[64:54] think it's it's everything is a little
[64:56] bit financially related but it it it
[64:58] makes it makes sense. Um, when I when I
[65:03] made a decision to jump from my my old
[65:06] job to this new adventure, and this also
[65:08] now full circle to to the beginning of
[65:10] the podcast, um, I had Bitcoin in the
[65:13] back of my mind. I was like, I already
[65:16] saved Bitcoin, so I don't know how long
[65:18] I can live from Bitcoin, but I can live
[65:20] along enough from Bitcoin so that I can
[65:24] find a new job. I don't have to suffer.
[65:26] I I I don't have to be homeless. I I
[65:28] have Bitcoin. And this is something that
[65:33] gives you a lot of security, a lot of
[65:34] like, hey, I can breathe. I I can take
[65:37] brave decisions. It makes a human being
[65:41] braver in his decision making. It makes
[65:43] a human being better in his decision
[65:46] making because he can take the decision
[65:49] in a calm and smart way and doesn't have
[65:51] to
[65:53] quickly rush rush the decision. So
[65:55] that's I think something that really
[65:57] changed in in the way of how I look at
[66:00] my life where I'm like, "Hey, I already
[66:03] have some some wealth in Bitcoin, so I
[66:07] can chill a little bit." Funny enough, I
[66:10] work now a lot more than I did
[66:12] previously,
[66:13] but because I liked it, because I love
[66:16] it.
 And this is this is something I've
[66:18] came to know. Bitcoiners
[66:22] have the optionality to change their
[66:24] jobs. A lot of people don't have that
[66:26] optionality. And that bravery is is
[66:30] really, really, really, really good. And
[66:33] there are a lot of other things that
[66:34] Bitcoin brings to life, but not to my
[66:37] life. For example, the whole banking
[66:41] story of like how it it it banks people
[66:44] that otherwise wouldn't be possible to
[66:46] be banked.
[66:48] So, but I was in Austria, so I I'm
[66:51] fortunate that I'm on top of the fiat uh
[66:55] system and not at the bottom of the fiat
[66:57] system. So, I'm I'm I'm fortunate in
[67:00] that regard. So, Bitcoin basically
[67:02] brought a bravery and the store of value
[67:04] to my world and not so much the the
[67:08] property rights or the spending, the
[67:11] banking and all those things. It's it's
[67:13] it's more about the store of value for
[67:15] for me personally, even though the other
[67:16] things are bigger and more important.
[67:19] Yeah. And um and I know you are still
[67:22] 27. You're turning 27 soon, but if you
[67:24] had to go back in uh if you had to go
[67:26] back in time and give your younger self
[67:28] advice, what would you tell yourself?
[67:31] Would you do anything different other
[67:32] than buying Bitcoin? Of course, don't
[67:34] none of that. What would you tell
[67:36] yourself?
[67:37] I wouldn't do anything different. I I I
[67:40] I I'm really fortunate how my life
[67:42] turned out. I I look at the decisions
[67:45] that I made and even the the decisions
[67:47] that I made poorly turned out to be
[67:49] great in the end of the day. So I think
[67:51] there's there's there's it feels like
[67:54] there's someone watching out for me. Uh
[67:55] there's the everything is kind of
[67:58] turning in in in in good directions even
[68:01] though it might have not felt like that
[68:03] in in that very moment.
[68:05] And so I'm extremely grateful and
[68:08] extremely um blessed with with an
[68:12] amazing life and I wouldn't do anything
[68:14] different. Um, and uh, I have a lot of
[68:18] lessons that I've learned along the way,
[68:20] but it's it's good that I learned it in
[68:22] the steps that I've learned it because
[68:25] if you learn if I've had all the lessons
[68:28] that I've already know now
[68:32] in when I was 18 years old, this would
[68:35] have maybe ruined my life because maybe
[68:38] then the steps how I naturally and
[68:41] organically learn those things would
[68:44] have messed up. And this would have uh
[68:46] stolen the the the joy of discovering
[68:50] those things. And so I I wouldn't do
[68:53] anything different. I wouldn't give
[68:55] myself any a twice because I want to
[68:58] learn in a natural organic way. But if
[69:02] someone that is 21 years old or 15 years
[69:06] old or in in the in the starting of that
[69:08] journey uh I I can tell you one thing
[69:14] be brave even if you cannot be brave be
[69:20] go there where it feels best
[69:24] where you know you should be even though
[69:26] it's hard. So, and and especially when
[69:30] you're young, under 30 years old is the
[69:33] time to make the risky decision. Above
[69:36] 30 years old, I cannot speak because I'm
[69:38] just 27 years old. I I still have to
[69:40] discover how it is. I
[69:44] know.
 Exactly. Exactly. I'm 26, not 27.
[69:48] I always
[69:51] I always mess up my age.
[69:54] So, I'm I'm really grateful for how my
[69:56] life turned out and and I'm I'm super
[69:59] thankful for all the decisions I I I
[70:01] took and what I've learned from them.
[70:02] And I if I go back to my 21-year-old, I
[70:06] would do everything in the same exact
[70:09] order in the same exact way.
 Nice, nice,
[70:11] nice. Wow. Nice. Well, man, thank you
[70:13] for your time, man. I appreciate it. You
[70:15] were like you're like the wisest 26 year
[70:17] old I ever talked to, man.
[70:21] probably because got to talk with so
[70:23] many old people on my podcast.
[70:26] Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. You're learning from
[70:28] everybody, man. That's that that's
[70:29] amazing, man. Where can people find you?
[70:34] Oh, sorry.
[70:37] Uh my my throat is getting uh really try
[70:41] talking the whole day.
[70:44] People can find me. So like if you want
[70:46] to watch my podcast uh uh on video

[71:13] uh here and there, I think Twitter is a
[71:15] a great place. I spend way too much time
[71:17] on Twitter, so I'm quite reachable
