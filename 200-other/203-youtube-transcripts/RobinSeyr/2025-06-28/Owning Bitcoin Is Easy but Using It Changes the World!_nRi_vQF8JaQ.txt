[00:00] I don't think SPR's changed the world. I
[00:02] don't think Sailor's, you know,
[00:04] acquisition of Bitcoin changes the
[00:05] world. I think it's how people
[00:07] ultimately end up using it that changes
[00:09] the world. They pay me in Bitcoin. Like
[00:11] we operate on a Bitcoin standard. It
[00:13] does work. And we we primarily use
[00:16] onchain. Do you want to have Bitcoin in
[00:18] self-custody that you control? I mean,
[00:20] that like true financial self-
[00:22] sovereignty or do you want to be, you
[00:25] know, your Bitcoin tied up as collateral
[00:26] in a lending product? They really need
[00:28] to ask themselves, why am I in Bitcoin?
[00:30] And if it's because of freedom and self-
[00:32] sovereignty and all the things that we
[00:33] talked about, you know, the cipher
[00:34] punks, then just buy Bitcoin. The closer
[00:36] that we can bring these determinations
[00:38] to home, the better. And like that's why
[00:40] I think the individual, the family unit,
[00:42] like those are the ultimate entities to
[00:45] be making these decisions. You're not a
[00:47] core developer and so you shouldn't have
[00:49] an opinion. And and to me, that's a very
[00:51] dangerous position to take. Lower your
[00:54] time preference. the barrier to to spend
[00:56] and replace to like, you know, go on
[00:58] River, go on wherever you buy your
[01:00] Bitcoin and immediately replace the
[01:02] Bitcoin that you just spent. I mean,
[01:04] it's almost no barrier.
[01:07] [Music]
[01:09] Hi, Michael Jordan. How are you doing?
[01:11] I'm doing great, Robin. Good to see you
[01:13] again.
 H Yeah, absolutely. We just met
[01:16] like not even a week ago, like in in
[01:18] Vegas. It's it's been it's been a
[01:20] pleasure uh seeing you. And how have how
[01:22] was the conference for you? you.
 It was
[01:24] great. You know, uh I know the the
[01:26] Bitcoin conference gets a lot of heat
[01:28] for some of the uh the sponsors and some
[01:30] of the talks and and that for me it's
[01:32] just an awesome networking opportunity
[01:34] to get to meet you in person and lots of
[01:37] clients. We have some unbelievable
[01:38] clients and uh a lot of partners. I've
[01:41] got some new podcast uh guests who are
[01:43] going to be coming on because of it. So,
[01:45] no complaints uh on my end.
 Awesome.
[01:48] Yeah, absolutely. and we we soon have
[01:51] the a little bit higher signal Bitcoin
[01:53] conference in Prague coming up. Are you
[01:54] also coming coming to Prague?
 Yeah,
[01:57] actually I I'm going to be speaking on
[01:58] the main stage in Prague. Uh so one of
[02:01] my my first uh big keynotes uh in Prague
[02:03] here in a couple of weeks, so I'm
[02:05] preparing for that. And uh it was uh it
[02:08] was something our chief marketing
[02:09] officer was supposed to be speaking. Um
[02:12] he's uh taking on a new project. And so
[02:14] I get to talk about one of my passions
[02:17] in Bitcoin, which is Bitcoin as money
[02:19] and uh using Bitcoin as money and uh
[02:23] transacting in it, those sorts of
[02:24] things. And I'm really looking forward
[02:26] to it. I think it'll be be a good time.
[02:28] Awesome. I think it's also a good um
[02:30] before we get started with all the
[02:32] topics, maybe give the people some some
[02:34] of your backgrounds, who you are, and
[02:36] why you're excited about Bitcoin.
 Yeah.
[02:39] Yeah. So, I've I've been in Bitcoin just
[02:41] a few years. So my my journey started in
[02:43] so in late 2021
[02:45] uh at the end of every year I set goals
[02:48] for the following year right of like New
[02:49] Year's resolutions and one of my New
[02:52] Year's resolutions each year is to learn
[02:54] about a new topic of interest and in
[02:56] late 2021 I decided I need to learn
[02:58] about this whole crypto thing like
[02:59] what's going on in the world why are
[03:01] people so excited about it and I was
[03:03] fortunate right at the end of the year
[03:05] as I was kind of gathering resources
[03:06] books podcasts to listen to I met a guy
[03:09] through a friend who was interested as
[03:12] well. And he told me, he said, you know,
[03:14] there's kind of this Bitcoin or this
[03:16] crypto horseshoe, this path that people
[03:18] take where they start in Bitcoin and
[03:20] then they go through the crypto phase
[03:21] and then they ultimately generally make
[03:23] their way back to Bitcoin. And so he
[03:26] gave me the name of Preston Pish's
[03:28] podcast. He told me about Lynn Alden.
[03:29] Those are the two people in particular I
[03:31] remember. And he told me, "Start with
[03:32] Preston's podcast on episode one and
[03:35] listen all the way through." And so I
[03:37] think he was u I think Preston was maybe
[03:39] 50some episodes in that. I think he's
[03:41] now, you know, in the several hundreds.
[03:43] And so I did. And it was throughout
[03:46] 2022, as you remember, that everything
[03:48] started collapsing crypto. You know, you
[03:51] saw Celsius, BlockFi, FTX, all of that
[03:54] stuff. And I began to realize as bit
[03:56] Bitcoin was making more and more sense
[03:58] to me, but I realized, wow, the Bitcoin
[04:00] maxis, these toxic maxis are right about
[04:02] everything, you know. And uh so I would
[04:05] say sometime I you know, mid late 2022,
[04:09] I was all in. I realized that was uh
[04:12] Bitcoin was the signal amongst the noise
[04:14] and uh my I mean I've had quite a
[04:17] journey since a lot of life changes uh
[04:19] making it to the Bitcoin way to work
[04:21] with this team now but um it's been it's
[04:24] been quite a ride.
 What do you think is
[04:27] something that
[04:29] right now most Bitcoiners would disagree
[04:32] with but uh the toxic Bitcoin maxes are
[04:35] kind of pushing. You
 Hey, you you broke
[04:38] up for a minute there. I lost all audio.
[04:40] Oh, are you hearing me now?
 One second.
[04:42] I don't know if it's my speakers or I
[04:44] don't know if it's your um
 I I hear you
[04:46] perfectly fine.
 Oh, hang on. Yeah, I
[04:49] lost I lost speakers here. Say that
[04:51] again.
 Do you hear me again?
 Yeah, now I
[04:54] can. It kicked over to the to a
[04:55] different speaker.
[04:57] Oh, so what is something that Bitcoiners
[05:00] What?
 Uh you you you hear me now again?
[05:02] Yeah. Can you hear me?
 Oh, yeah.
[05:04] Absolutely. I I hear you perfectly fine.
[05:06] Usually when someone kicks out it's it's
[05:08] it's it gets messy but you are very
[05:10] clear like I think you have a good
[05:12] internet connection also.
 Okay. Good.
[05:14] Good. Um so so I'm sorry ask your
[05:16] question again then.
 Um I I was asking
[05:19] uh because you said like the Bitcoin the
[05:21] toxic Bitcoin max is the one that's
[05:23] always right. And I tend to agree with
[05:25] that that uh those who push like the the
[05:28] hard things at the current moment.
[05:30] You're like, hey, like they're pushing
[05:32] really hard, but then they end up being
[05:34] right at at the end of the cycle. Um
[05:38] what do you think is one thing that a
[05:40] lot of Bitcoiners uh would disagree with
[05:43] or like is is right now kind of uh
[05:46] mainstream but the toxic Bitcoin maxes
[05:49] are kind of pushing for now.
 Uh that's a
[05:52] good question. So I I don't it's it's
[05:55] it's sometimes hard to distinguish the
[05:57] toxic maxis from the general maxis. I
[06:01] think something for me that stands out
[06:03] is there are a small handful of people
[06:05] who I think are concerned about what
[06:08] some of these Bitcoin lending products
[06:10] mean and what the implications are. Uh I
[06:13] would say I tend to fall toward a um a
[06:16] more or more overtly toxic maxi position
[06:19] on many of those things. And so, um, my
[06:22] my general position on them is f first
[06:24] of all, it's a free market, right? If,
[06:26] um, you know, if Strike or or any of
[06:28] these companies want to offer those
[06:30] sorts of products, I I think they have
[06:31] every right to do so. I think everyone
[06:33] has a right to, you know, enter a
[06:35] contractual agreement and uh, make a
[06:38] determination as to whether or not
[06:39] that's a fit for them. I think that the
[06:42] the challenge for most people is that
[06:45] they're very most people are very bad at
[06:47] evaluating risk and they they think the
[06:50] risk is well what's the price of Bitcoin
[06:52] going to do and how much of my stack am
[06:55] I am I going to put up as as collateral
[06:56] to take out a loan and what you know
[06:58] what's the interest rate and they they
[07:00] kind of do this very simple math
[07:03] and you know I think that the risk
[07:05] extends way beyond that in a very
[07:08] meaningful and impactful way to well who
[07:10] who are the counterparties who's
[07:12] securing it how much of your sensitive
[07:14] information are you giving up because of
[07:16] KYC uh what's the regulatory risk
[07:18] exposure to a 6102 style attack you know
[07:21] we see all this uh the US government
[07:23] right now is talking about blowing up
[07:25] the debt ceiling and just saying it
[07:26] doesn't exist anymore um obviously they
[07:29] think things are bad if they're doing
[07:31] that as Trump and Elizabeth Warren have
[07:32] said to avoid economic catastrophe so in
[07:35] a catastrophic situation uh do they come
[07:38] for your Bitcoin do they shut these
[07:39] companies down? Do they somehow
[07:41] intervene and create real problems for
[07:43] people? And I think most people uh
[07:47] probably just fail to recognize the u
[07:51] that those risks are are not just
[07:53] hypothetical, but could actually come to
[07:55] fruition certainly in an e in a
[07:57] catastrophic sort of situation. Uh you
[08:00] know, I mean, you know, us at the
[08:01] Bitcoin way, we're all about
[08:02] self-custody. I mean really having
[08:04] Bitcoin outside of the system where you
[08:06] control the private keys that is like
[08:08] the holy grail of of that's what makes
[08:11] Bitcoin what it is. I think there are a
[08:13] lot of people who are probably going to
[08:14] play around with sort of fiat products
[08:16] built on top of Bitcoin and pay the
[08:18] price. My caveat to that I would say is
[08:21] I think there are some Bitcoiners short
[08:22] of a catastrophic you know economic
[08:24] meltdown there are some Bitcoiners who
[08:26] have enough Bitcoin. They understand the
[08:28] custodial risks. they've got, you know,
[08:29] a stack sufficiently large to, you know,
[08:32] cover collateral, an 80% draw down in
[08:34] Bitcoin's price, all all of these sorts
[08:36] of things. Uh, that maybe they come out
[08:38] unscathed, and good for them if they do,
[08:41] but I don't think it's probably I think
[08:42] it's a product that far too many people
[08:44] are getting excited about when there's
[08:46] probably 1% of the Bitcoin population
[08:49] who should really consider that as a
[08:51] viable option.
[08:53] Interesting.
 That's my toxic maxi
[08:55] position, I guess.
[08:56] I think it's it's a common sense
[08:58] position. Honestly, the idea if you
[09:00] think about it first principles is like
[09:03] let's say you because it's loan to value
[09:05] is usually like around 50%. Um so if you
[09:08] for example uh want to have $50,000 and
[09:13] like if if it's lower than that I I
[09:15] would question why you even doing it. Uh
[09:17] but if if you want $50,000
[09:20] um you have to give out $100,000 in
[09:24] Bitcoin. So you basically give out a
[09:26] full bitcoin to get $50,000 in fiat back
[09:30] and you are inclined to have risks like
[09:34] the the the bitcoin can be like even if
[09:37] they are acting in best interest maybe
[09:38] it gets stolen from platform maybe the
[09:40] platform goes under like there's so many
[09:42] even if you assume everyone is a good
[09:44] actor even then there's so many risks
[09:47] associated with that and I don't like
[09:49] the idea that retail is giving up
[09:51] bitcoin to get feared like like that
[09:54] concept is just like really foreign to
[09:57] me and like it does not make sense and
[09:59] it's really interesting because I and I
[10:02] I mentioned it on the podcast with Tony.
[10:04] Tony and the Bitcoin way pushed me to
[10:06] accept Bitcoin payments. I did not
[10:08] accept Bitcoin payments actually before
[10:10] Tony and Tonyy's like oh why are you not
[10:11] accepting Bitcoin payments? Uh and he's
[10:14] totally right and now I think like 70 or
[10:16] 80% of my income is fully directly in
[10:19] Bitcoin. So that's uh definitely a
[10:21] thanks to Tony and the Bitcoin way. Um,
[10:23] and naturally I came to the conclusion
[10:26] that I either have to sell Bitcoin to
[10:28] cover fiat bills or I have to borrow
[10:30] against my Bitcoin or I just have to get
[10:33] uh loans in other ways. Um, and I
[10:37] ultimately decided to just sell my
[10:39] Bitcoin. Like I I still make more
[10:41] Bitcoin each month, but uh I sell some
[10:44] Bitcoin to cover the the fiat bills and
[10:47] not borrow against them. If you have
[10:48] like 10% you can pay in Bitcoin, but you
[10:51] get 70% paid in Bitcoin. And it's a way
[10:54] better system for me to just have like
[10:57] the emotional calmness
[10:59] uh to to deal with with the volatility
[11:02] and everything like that. And I think
[11:04] it's the more it's it's more the Bitcoin
[11:07] away, the the the Bitcoin way. I love
[11:08] the the name of the company also.
 Yeah.
[11:11] No, I I I agree with you. I think the
[11:12] other complaint I maybe have is is one
[11:14] that's more philosophical and I'll be
[11:15] I'll be speaking about it in Prague in a
[11:17] couple of weeks is I I I believe Bitcoin
[11:20] is money and I know there's a lot of
[11:21] philosophizing about what money is and
[11:24] how do we define it but but to me is
[11:26] good money stores as a serve of value.
[11:28] You can use it as a medium of exchange
[11:29] and it can you know account for value.
[11:31] It's a a measuring stick for value and
[11:33] the reason Bitcoin does all of those
[11:34] things well is because it's scarce. It's
[11:36] decentralized. All of the these things
[11:37] that we talk about. My other concern, I
[11:40] guess, with these products is that it
[11:42] doesn't um push forward the the the the
[11:45] narrative and the adoption of Bitcoin as
[11:48] all of those use cases. If you know, you
[11:51] you it's it's easy to slide into this
[11:53] place of complacency where you say,
[11:54] "Well, I'll just, you know, coll take
[11:57] out a loan, use Bitcoin as collateral,
[11:58] and I'll keep using fiat." I think what
[12:00] we need to be doing proactively is
[12:03] urging and encouraging and maybe even
[12:05] demanding our suppliers, vendors, you
[12:07] know, store, local stores, um your local
[12:10] farmer, whoever it is to accept Bitcoin
[12:12] as payment. And if you know that you
[12:14] have what perceives to be a free lunch
[12:17] of this, you know, loan that you you
[12:19] take out fiat and keep paying with fiat,
[12:21] we we continue to feed into the system,
[12:23] right? We perpetuate that. And uh I
[12:26] understand the practical reality that
[12:29] today if I go to the g, you know, my
[12:31] local grocery store, they're not going
[12:32] to accept Bitcoin. And I'm not probably
[12:34] going to talk a chain of, you know, a
[12:35] grocery chain into accepting Bitcoin.
[12:38] But I think it's easy to just concede
[12:41] that to, you know, these uh to the whims
[12:44] of of companies and and uh certainly
[12:47] governments. And the more that we can do
[12:49] to to push forward Bitcoin as a medium
[12:52] of exchange, I think over time that's
[12:54] how that application of our demand in
[12:56] the marketplace is what leads Bitcoin to
[12:59] winning in the way that I want it to win
[13:02] because I think we need it to win in
[13:04] that way for the bright orange future.
[13:05] If it's just if it's exclusively a store
[13:08] of value and it's just governments
[13:09] buying it and it's just corporations
[13:11] holding it forever and ever, I mean,
[13:13] good. I think the value is going to go
[13:14] up. It's a scarce, you know, digital
[13:16] asset. has all these advantages, but we
[13:18] need it to be the medium of exchange use
[13:19] case before I think we, you know, see
[13:22] the end of Forever Wars, for example,
[13:24] before we see a lot of the net benefits
[13:26] that we anticipate, you know, a Bitcoin
[13:28] standard uh bringing into the world. One
[13:30] question that I always have is like are
[13:32] we maybe too are we trying to pull the
[13:36] future a little bit uh too fast forward
[13:39] into the present of like yeah like
[13:41] Bitcoin has to prove it's a store of
[13:43] value and then we we can also have the
[13:44] med of exchange and maybe we we want the
[13:46] med of exchange too quick and and we
[13:50] we're not yet over the store of value
[13:52] phase like the the natural phases of
[13:53] like how how money progresses.
 It's a
[13:55] good question. I think that there are
[13:58] people who if they understood who there
[14:00] there are a lot of people to I mean to
[14:02] your point who understand that you're
[14:03] doing a podcast you understand the store
[14:05] of value use case you weren't accepting
[14:07] Bitcoin at one point in time and it took
[14:09] Tony pushing you but now you guys are
[14:11] adding to this like Bitcoin circular
[14:13] economy together because we won't pay
[14:14] any we won't we only use Bitcoin we
[14:16] operate on a Bitcoin standard and so I
[14:19] think there's something to be said that
[14:20] there are a lot of people who haven't
[14:21] acknowledged Bitcoin as a store of value
[14:23] yet they're just asleep at the wheel
[14:25] they're not paying attention or They
[14:26] haven't been sold yet. Yeah. I mean,
[14:28] they're not going to accept Bitcoin as a
[14:30] medium of exchange, probably. I will say
[14:32] that the the farmer who supplies me raw
[14:34] uh raw goat milk is going to accept
[14:36] Bitcoin from me. She doesn't know
[14:38] anything about Bitcoin. She kind of
[14:39] understands there's something to this
[14:41] whole thing. And, you know, it's no skin
[14:42] off her back. And so, there are probably
[14:44] easy asks in your life that you could
[14:46] ask people to accept as a medium of
[14:47] exchange. But I think it's a it's a trap
[14:50] to assume that everyone has to, you
[14:53] know, or everyone or some very large
[14:54] majority of people have to acknowledge
[14:57] the store of value before those of us
[14:59] who already understand the store of
[15:00] value can begin migrating to the medium
[15:02] of exchange use case. And I think there
[15:05] are a lot of uh you know very
[15:07] entrepreneurial Bitcoiners out there who
[15:10] could begin accepting Bitcoin who
[15:11] currently aren't. And it's just sort of
[15:14] this thing that I will build upon itself
[15:16] as we extend out and continue to educate
[15:19] the people who maybe aren't there yet,
[15:21] haven't, you know, haven't accepted it
[15:22] as store of value. So, I'm not really
[15:25] concerned about pulling it uh like
[15:27] pulling that that future back too soon.
[15:30] I I think I would heir on the side of
[15:32] caution that if we don't push for and
[15:34] promote that as Bitcoiners, especially
[15:36] within our own circle of people who
[15:37] generally, you know, align with us on on
[15:40] the role of Bitcoin in the world, I
[15:42] think that to me seems to be a bigger
[15:43] risk than uh pushing it off, you know,
[15:46] further.
 Sorry, pulling pulling it
[15:48] forward too soon. Rather,
 I had Jeff Pu
[15:50] on I think like two months ago,
[15:52] something like that. Uh and and he he
[15:54] said something that that kind of stuck
[15:55] in my brain ever since and I've
[15:57] mentioned it probably like 10 times
[15:58] already in the podcast. He said the
[16:00] sentence if Bitcoin fails as a medium of
[16:02] exchange, it will also fail as a store
[16:04] of value. I'm I'm I'm 100% undecided on
[16:08] that one. Uh just because like we have a
[16:11] store of values like real estate and
[16:13] gold that are horrible medium of
[16:15] exchanges in in the current world, but
[16:17] they still have a lot of value. But at
[16:19] the same time I'm like if gold also
[16:21] would be the best medium of exchange the
[16:24] store of value would be so much bigger.
[16:26] So how do you how do you look at uh the
[16:29] one requiring the other one in both
[16:31] directions.
 Yeah. So I' I've heard Jeff
[16:34] Booth say share that on several
[16:36] occasions. I'm a big fan of Jeff Booth.
[16:37] Love him. And he he's he's a guy who uh
[16:39] you know puts his money where his mouth
[16:41] is and u I think I've learned a lot from
[16:44] him. I for the the reason you described
[16:46] there would tend to pro probably
[16:48] disagree though I'm completely open to
[16:50] being wrong about this one that I think
[16:52] Bitcoin can still serve as a store of
[16:54] value even if we even if it never
[16:56] achieves like broad medium of exchange
[16:58] adoption and the reason like you said is
[17:01] you've got gold I mean gold's
[17:02] appreciating value no one practically uh
[17:05] is using gold as a medium of exchange I
[17:08] mean for obvious reasons it's heavy it's
[17:11] expensive to insure and secure and ship
[17:13] and Um it's a I mean we live in a global
[17:16] digital world and a a piece of metal
[17:19] isn't an effective medium of exchange in
[17:22] any you know at scale I guess even if
[17:25] governments might settle in in that I
[17:26] think and that's why you see a lot of
[17:28] paper gold out there and IUS and those
[17:31] sorts of things. Um, so I I think that
[17:35] Bitcoin can't, and I think this is this
[17:37] is maybe the trap is that Bitcoiners
[17:40] don't fully buy into Jeff Booth's thesis
[17:43] because I think he he could be incorrect
[17:45] about that. I think it could serve as a
[17:46] store of value. And so we hold on to the
[17:49] Bitcoin, which I think is a good thing
[17:51] to do. I think I I save in Bitcoin. I
[17:52] think other people should save in
[17:53] Bitcoin. Um, as though them becoming
[17:57] rich over some some long period of time
[17:59] is the end all. To me, the end all is
[18:02] the bright orange future that we talk
[18:04] about. And it's very easy for you to get
[18:06] sucked into this um this narrative of
[18:09] Bitcoin as a store of value and a
[18:11] reserve asset and an investment and to
[18:14] perceive it exclusively as a store of
[18:16] value. And the thing I always say is if
[18:18] ultimately militaries aren't using
[18:21] Bitcoin to buy fighter jets, then I
[18:24] don't think the forever wars end. And
[18:26] that doesn't mean that your Bitcoin may
[18:27] not appreciate in value and that some,
[18:29] you know, you own one Bitcoin and 10
[18:31] years from now, 20 years from now, your,
[18:32] you know, your purchasing power isn't
[18:34] enormous. Yeah, I think that's probably
[18:36] very likely. But do we live in a
[18:38] material materially better world? I'm
[18:42] I'm less convinced of that.
[18:44] It's also interesting when we look at
[18:47] um the stages that are filled with with
[18:50] people. for example, Michael Sailor is
[18:52] is a big one, but now we have many more
[18:56] CEOs that use Bitcoin as a treasury. Um,
[19:00] as a treasury asset like Metablanet, I
[19:03] think Simon Govich I maybe I butcher his
[19:07] name now. Uh, and and then we have Sem
[19:10] Scientific with Eric Smler, many others
[19:13] uh examples and many like there's alo
[19:15] just the bigger ones and there are many
[19:17] smaller companies. Is that kind of where
[19:19] maybe just like the the narrative right
[19:21] now comes of Bitcoin as a treasury
[19:23] company and then retail sees all all
[19:25] those companies are uh lending getting
[19:28] like a billion dollars to buy Bitcoin at
[19:30] 0% interest rates. So I also want to do
[19:32] something similar that this is kind of
[19:34] the the reason why store value and those
[19:38] borrow against the Bitcoin and lending
[19:40] products are kind of really bush now.
[19:42] Yeah, I think that uh so first of all,
[19:44] you know, I'm not I'm not here to
[19:46] disparrage anyone. I think Michael
[19:47] Sailor is a financial genius. I think
[19:50] he's going to be the wealthiest man in
[19:51] the world here in the very near future,
[19:53] certainly in the next, you know, five or
[19:55] 10 years. And I think his conviction in
[19:58] Bitcoin is because of his conviction in
[20:00] Bitcoin, that will be welld deserved. I
[20:03] think that
[20:04] as his Bitcoin journey has gone on,
[20:07] because I remember listening to him my
[20:08] first, you know, year or two in Bitcoin,
[20:10] learned a lot. Uh I've been less
[20:12] impressed with the narrative that he's
[20:14] pushing. Now, where I where I empathize
[20:17] with his situation is he has a publicly
[20:19] traded company that is, you know, he's
[20:21] he's got regulators and auditors and all
[20:23] sorts of people paying a lot of
[20:24] attention to what he's doing, whether
[20:26] he's in Bitcoin or not.
[20:28] My concern is that to frame Bitcoin, to
[20:32] pigeon hole it as exclusively digital
[20:34] capital, which is generally the
[20:35] narrative. I don't listen to him quite
[20:37] as frequently as I used to, but uh to to
[20:40] frame Bitcoin in in that way um really
[20:44] uh I I think it's a disservice to people
[20:47] who are trying to figure out what
[20:49] Bitcoin is sort of in totality. And
[20:52] that's where uh I I think we see more
[20:54] and more people like I've seen a lot of
[20:56] people online, they're like, "Oh, I'm
[20:57] not going to stake and shake. I'm not
[20:58] going to spend my Bitcoin. And to me,
[21:02] it's like the lower your time
[21:04] preference. Like the the barrier to uh
[21:07] to spend and replace to like, you know,
[21:09] go on River, go on wherever you buy your
[21:11] Bitcoin and immediately replace the
[21:13] Bitcoin that you just spent is I mean,
[21:16] it's almost no barrier. It's a really
[21:18] bad excuse to say, "Well, I'm not I'm
[21:19] not going to spend it." Just replace it.
[21:21] It's, you know, a pretty straightforward
[21:22] thing. You can do it on your phone right
[21:24] there. And uh I do think though that as
[21:27] governments talk about SBS uh all the
[21:30] attention that Sailor gets about the
[21:31] accumulation of Bitcoin he's doing and
[21:33] he's talking about never selling. I
[21:35] think it creates this unhelpful
[21:37] narrative to those of us who are trying
[21:39] to educate people on Bitcoin for the
[21:42] purpose of money that changes the world.
[21:44] I don't think SPRs change the world. I
[21:47] don't think sailor's you know
[21:49] acquisition of Bitcoin changes the
[21:50] world. I think it's how people
[21:52] ultimately end up using it that changes
[21:54] the world. And so you sort of have to
[21:55] step back and just say, well, what
[21:57] what's my goal with Bitcoin? If your
[21:59] goal with Bitcoin is just to get
[22:01] wealthy, like, okay, yeah, maybe, you
[22:03] know, have your own strategic reserve
[22:05] and like that's it. If your goal is, I
[22:07] want a brighter future for my kids. I
[22:09] want uh, you know, the elimination of
[22:11] Forever Wars. I want incentives to
[22:13] realign. So all of the nonsense that we
[22:15] see every day in the news, it begins to,
[22:19] you know, disappear. Then I think we
[22:21] need to to reframe and reorient
[22:23] ourselves to Bitcoin as peer-to-peer
[22:25] electronic cash. And the fact that it's
[22:27] pro programmable engineered money means
[22:30] that new solutions are going to come
[22:32] about to make that even easier. Uh
[22:34] there's going to be more, you know,
[22:35] self-custodial options out there. It's
[22:37] going to be, you know, lower friction
[22:39] over time for people to enter and use
[22:41] Bitcoin the way I believe it was not
[22:43] only designed to be used but ought to be
[22:45] used uh for promotion of a a much better
[22:49] more prosperous world.
 Important do you
[22:51] think for Bitcoin overall it is what
[22:54] kind of narrative there currently is in
[22:57] Bitcoin in the Bitcoin community? What
[22:58] is kind of like the the push narrative?
[23:00] How how important do I think uh it is
[23:03] that we we promote Bitcoin in like with
[23:06] the proper with the proper narrative or
[23:08] or
 Yeah, the the the kind of where I
[23:11] want to go is because there are many
[23:14] different narratives in the Bitcoin
[23:16] community depending on what time you
[23:18] live in. So if we go back in the in in
[23:21] in in the time machine to 2015 where the
[23:25] Bitcoin community was completely
[23:26] different um there was a lot of a
[23:29] different narrative in in the community
[23:31] when you go back in I don't know 2012.
[23:34] I was not in the Bitcoin community in
[23:36] both of those times. But I can imagine
[23:38] it's probably a lot different to to the
[23:40] narrative that is now into the Bitcoin
[23:42] ecosystem. And I'm just wondering if
[23:45] that narrative
[23:48] might it's just adopting to what is
[23:52] currently the the level we're playing at
[23:54] and right now we are coming into
[23:57] companies and to um uh even nations
[24:01] adopting it. So I'm like, how how
[24:04] important is it to to keep that Bitcoin
[24:07] ethos, that cipher bank ethos, that
[24:09] peer-to-peer cash ethos in the
[24:11] community?
 And is there a chance if that
[24:15] ethos and that narrative is kind of lost
[24:17] that maybe also the core properties
[24:20] slowly get lost because everyone is kind
[24:22] of I own own bitcoin.
 Yeah. No, I think
[24:26] I think that's a real risk. I think
[24:28] Bitcoin uh I think Bitcoin the protocol
[24:31] is probably as cipher punk as it's ever
[24:34] been. I think Bitcoiners are not. And I
[24:37] think it's very easy for people to get
[24:41] caught up in these more modern
[24:42] narratives of what Bitcoin is and to
[24:46] lose uh an appreciation for the
[24:48] importance of self- sovereignty. I think
[24:49] it's why, you know, we're yelling at
[24:51] people from the mountain tops to uh get
[24:53] your coins off of the exchanges. And you
[24:55] know, we still have clients every day
[24:56] coming to us and say, "I've got my coins
[24:58] at Coinbase or whatever."
[25:00] The the beauty of Bitcoin is is not
[25:05] simply that it's, you know,
[25:07] decentralized. It's scarce. It's uh
[25:10] censorship resistant. Like I all of
[25:12] those are critical attributes it must
[25:14] retain to succeed in in the way I think
[25:16] most Bitcoiners, toxic or otherwise,
[25:19] would uh you know, it it needs to retain
[25:22] those. I think most people would agree
[25:23] with that.
[25:25] But the interesting thing for me that
[25:27] I've seen is more and more people are
[25:29] catching on to this thesis of like Larry
[25:31] Leard's the big print for example right
[25:33] and what are the implications of that
[25:35] and if you know we're 36 37 almost 37
[25:39] trillion in debt right now in the United
[25:41] you know our US the US government well
[25:43] what does that mean well it means that
[25:44] they're going to have to print a lot of
[25:46] money in that and at some point they
[25:48] can't kick the can any further and
[25:49] things get really ugly and so what do
[25:51] you want to have do you want to have
[25:54] Bitcoin in self-custody that you
[25:56] control. I mean that like true financial
[25:58] self- sovereignty or do you want to be
[26:01] you have your Bitcoin tied up as
[26:03] collateral in a lending product or do
[26:04] you want to have you know if taking on
[26:06] debt to fund someone else's purchase of
[26:08] Bitcoin and then they're you know a
[26:11] derivative removed custodying with a a
[26:13] third party who's susceptible to hacks
[26:15] or a malicious employee you know doing
[26:18] something wrong and uh I think this the
[26:21] cipher punk narrative and again like I
[26:23] I've been around three years I wasn't
[26:25] I'm not going the I wasn't on the
[26:27] original mailing list or anything uh of
[26:29] the white paper, but the further into it
[26:32] I get, the more convinced I am that that
[26:34] the longer we can retain that narrative,
[26:37] the better because I know that as we
[26:39] sort of enter this early uh early
[26:41] majority stage, we're going to have a
[26:43] lot less of that. And so the more people
[26:45] we can have who have been around for a
[26:47] couple of years who at least do have
[26:49] some of that understanding of the
[26:50] importance of self like real self-
[26:52] sovereignty the better we can educate
[26:54] more of that early majority as they come
[26:56] in. There are always going to be be
[26:58] people who come in for exclusively
[27:01] number go up it's an investment they
[27:03] just allocate to the ETFs or what have
[27:05] you. But the higher percentage of we of
[27:08] people that we can have operating on a
[27:10] Bitcoin standard, trying to find ways to
[27:12] use Bitcoin, securing their own keys,
[27:14] running their own node, I I think that
[27:16] is that's crucial to the ongoing success
[27:19] of the Bitcoin network because who knows
[27:21] when the next, you know, fork war is
[27:23] coming and Black Rockck decides they
[27:25] want to, you know, remove the hard cap
[27:27] or whatever. And they've got, you know,
[27:29] I don't know how they have contractually
[27:31] agreed upon what happens in that sort of
[27:33] scenario with the uh holders of the
[27:34] ETFs. Certainly the people in power and
[27:37] the, you know, whether it's the the
[27:39] Larry Finins or the Jaime Diamonds or
[27:42] politicians, they they have much less
[27:45] incentive than people like you and I to
[27:47] use Bitcoin in a self-s sovereign way. I
[27:49] mean, the the existing the legacy system
[27:51] has benefited them immensely. And the
[27:54] longer they can perpetuate that, they're
[27:56] going to. And so the more of us that can
[27:58] be running our own nodes, taking full
[27:59] control of our keys, all of these things
[28:02] that I think the cipher punks talk about
[28:04] and and emphasize, I think the more
[28:07] prepared we are for a a better future.
[28:10] And,
[28:11] you know, it's not that I'm it's not
[28:13] that I'm bearish on on any of that
[28:15] stuff. It's that I have my concerns and
[28:17] I think it needs to be a wakeup call for
[28:19] for many Bitcoiners. Um, so stay
[28:22] focused. Like, you know, I know there,
[28:25] you know, we talk about Omega candles
[28:27] and Wall Street adoption, all of these
[28:29] things. I know it's exciting for the
[28:30] price. We all want to be wealthy. Me,
[28:31] too. I'm not pretending like I just
[28:33] simply don't care about number go up.
[28:35] But in terms of where I view my life 20
[28:37] years from now, it's it's a much smaller
[28:39] piece of that puzzle. And I'm much more
[28:42] excited that I'm going to have control
[28:44] of what I do with my wealth and the
[28:46] flexibility to go where I want to go and
[28:48] do the things I want to do. And it's not
[28:50] exclusively because the purchasing power
[28:52] of Bitcoin has increased, although
[28:53] that's a piece of it. Uh, but it's
[28:56] because I control the purchasing power
[28:58] of the Bitcoin that I've accumulated at
[29:00] that time. I I see number go technology
[29:04] as the Trojan horse for for freedom.
[29:07] It's the one like I was not interested
[29:10] at all in any sovereignty rights. was
[29:12] not cipher bank at all before Bitcoin
[29:15] and Bitcoiners and Bitcoin pushed me
[29:19] more and more in in that direction. As I
[29:21] said, Tony was was one part but many
[29:23] others uh beforehand before I even
[29:26] started the podcast on on Bitcoin
[29:28] Twitter. I love of Twitter because
[29:31] they can be brutally honest and and
[29:33] brutally direct direct sometimes and I
[29:35] love that because it gives you actual
[29:37] feedback and not just like oh like okay
[29:39] do your thing. Um and to that extent
[29:43] I I'm I'm I'm very I'm very interested
[29:46] in how it plays out because I I see um
[29:50] Sailor for example even adopting his
[29:52] speech uh and now saying also not just
[29:54] Bitcoin but crypto. He's still saying
[29:56] there's no second best but not as much
[29:58] as previously and now he's also talking
[30:00] about Bitcoin and crypto. Um, how like
[30:04] how far does he just adjust his speech
[30:07] to
[30:08] be appeal appealing to the vice
[30:12] president and the president and be
[30:14] appealing to to other people in the
[30:15] space to get kind of Bitcoin through the
[30:18] door and he knows Bitcoin is anyways not
[30:22] uh destroyable and it will also get the
[30:26] freedom technology in there once people
[30:28] just like get get in like oh like we
[30:30] need the number technology But then we
[30:32] got the the freedom. So it's like those
[30:34] fear and this bitcoin system. The the
[30:36] the the bitcoin system is kind of the
[30:38] Trojan horse for freedom and the fiat
[30:40] system is try kind of trying to co-opt
[30:42] it. And uh I think Bitcoin will win out
[30:45] because open s open systems uh usually
[30:48] win out in the long run. Uh but it's
[30:51] just so fascinating and interesting for
[30:53] me how the narrative es especially as a
[30:55] podcast and you probably also as a as a
[30:57] podcaster. uh the the narrative is so
[31:00] interesting how how it shakes out and
[31:01] how different people have different
[31:03] stance on it and with over 500 guests
[31:05] I've have had many different views on on
[31:07] this podcast on this topic.
 Yeah, you
[31:10] know I think I think you're right to a
[31:12] large extent like uh when I came into
[31:14] Bitcoin I mean it was it was the the
[31:15] number go up and all the all the buzz
[31:17] around crypto that that intrigued me. Um
[31:20] I think it's it's just important that as
[31:22] few people stay in that mindset as
[31:25] possible. Uh but as I said, it gets
[31:27] harder and harder over time. I I think
[31:29] you and I and anyone who's sort of been
[31:31] in Bitcoin uh longer is uh we tend to be
[31:35] a more disagreeable, curious bunch of
[31:37] people who are open to maybe things
[31:40] aren't as they seem. Uh and and
[31:44] yeah, I'll be honest with you, like I
[31:46] I'm I'm really disappointed with the way
[31:48] a lot of people now u including Michael
[31:50] Sailor are framing Bitcoin. I uh I
[31:53] didn't stick around for the entirety of
[31:54] his speech. I I I I just, you know, it's
[31:56] no knock on him. It's just I feel like
[31:58] I've kind of heard the narrative and uh
[32:00] you know, disagree with enough of it. I
[32:02] it just wasn't it wasn't very
[32:04] interesting to me. Always cool to see
[32:06] him. You know, he's a he's a great
[32:08] communicator and uh I know people love
[32:10] him. I I went to JD Vance's speech just
[32:12] cuz how often do you get to see the vice
[32:15] pres of the United States? Um but it was
[32:19] yeah it was there there was
[32:22] I didn't walk away with any new
[32:24] information from from a speech like that
[32:27] and it was um you know just the Trump
[32:29] administration is is doing this and
[32:30] great if they break down regulatory
[32:32] barriers awesome but I think in general
[32:35] the extent to which we can ignore the
[32:37] talking heads the better and just focus
[32:40] in on our own lives I mean that's for
[32:42] for me the the kicker is I'm giving away
[32:44] a little bit of my speech in Prague here
[32:45] in a couple weeks is like being the
[32:47] change we want to in the world has
[32:48] nothing to do with what Michael Sailor
[32:50] or JD Vance or Donald Trump or Elon Musk
[32:52] or fill-in-theblank you know powerful
[32:55] famous you know wealthy person is doing
[32:58] has to do with what are the decisions
[32:59] you're making in your own life right
[33:01] like how how are you choosing to save
[33:03] how are you choosing to uh you know
[33:05] evade the theft that is taking place on
[33:09] a broad scale across the world by
[33:11] governments and others and yeah I mean I
[33:14] think sailor's crypto narrative And you
[33:18] know, it's it's like on one hand I feel
[33:19] like he's saying there's no second best.
[33:21] On the other hand, he's saying, "Hey,
[33:22] look at all these fiat products that you
[33:24] can buy, you know, through strategy."
[33:28] Uh, you know, maybe these are a second
[33:30] best or maybe they are first best. And I
[33:32] think some of that's maybe a complaint I
[33:33] have with the marketing of a lot of
[33:35] these Bitcoin Treasury products.
[33:38] I do recognize that there are people,
[33:40] and this is like the So, I've sort I
[33:42] sort of laid out like the philosophical
[33:43] disagreement.
[33:45] I think practically speaking there are
[33:47] people who have a bitcoin stack kind of
[33:50] like the lending thing they want to
[33:51] speculate on one of strategies products
[33:54] and you know they but I think most
[33:56] people just like they don't understand
[33:58] counterparty risk of of you know the the
[34:00] fiat or the bitcoin back loans they
[34:04] don't understand that the bit you're
[34:07] basically giving money to Michael Sailor
[34:09] to go buy bitcoin for his company it's
[34:12] not a bitcoin play like you're not
[34:15] buying Bitcoin. You're not doing Bitcoin
[34:17] or or or whatever you it is you think
[34:19] you're doing. You're buying an equity or
[34:20] you're buying debt in a fiat company and
[34:23] they just so happen to buy to be buying
[34:25] Bitcoin with it. I'm all for like I'm
[34:28] I'm the the thing I I love about Sailor
[34:30] is his conviction in Bitcoin and the
[34:32] fact that he is uh he's you know one of
[34:35] the first very public corporate adopters
[34:37] of Bitcoin. I think individuals,
[34:39] families, companies should be buying
[34:41] Bitcoin. I think that's a very prudent
[34:42] thing to I feel very differently about
[34:44] governments buying Bitcoin for for other
[34:45] reasons. But the fact that like if I
[34:49] here's here's maybe maybe my my my
[34:52] biggest issue. If I owned a company, if
[34:54] I own strategy,
[34:56] what I feel like ethically would be the
[34:58] right way of approaching it would be
[35:00] we're going to use free cash flow to buy
[35:01] Bitcoin. We're gonna convert existing
[35:04] reserves into Bitcoin and we're going to
[35:07] um
[35:09] you know we're gonna uh yeah I think
[35:13] those are those are probably the main
[35:14] way we're going to accept Bitcoin as
[35:15] payment say. Okay. So like those are the
[35:17] ways we're going to accumulate Bitcoin.
[35:19] Michael Sailor is making the correct
[35:21] financial decision because he's able to
[35:23] buy way way way more Bitcoin accessing
[35:26] the the credit markets but at the
[35:30] expense of having to pull other people
[35:32] in to basically fund these purchases for
[35:34] him versus allowing his you know from my
[35:36] understanding I haven't looked in a
[35:37] while but cash flow positive company to
[35:39] accumulate Bitcoin in a more
[35:41] conservative way. he'd have a lot less
[35:43] Bitcoin, but we'd also have a lot less
[35:45] people tied up in a fiat game that they
[35:48] think is somehow related to Bitcoin, you
[35:50] know, and so, you know, I think back
[35:53] like my dad was a small business owner.
[35:54] He sold his business a few years ago.
[35:56] Um, and he he he was he was never into
[35:58] Bitcoin. Unfortunately, I found it too
[36:00] late to to fill him in, but uh it was a
[36:03] small company. They didn't have access
[36:04] to, you know, 0% uh you know, debt. So,
[36:09] uh, he would have just had to take
[36:10] existing cash flows or his existing
[36:12] reserves and put it into Bitcoin. But I
[36:14] think that would have been a great way
[36:15] to do it. You end up with less Bitcoin
[36:17] perhaps, but you don't put a bunch of
[36:19] people at risk. You you're not taking on
[36:21] a bunch of leverage. I don't think it it
[36:23] makes you a triple maxi to to take on
[36:26] lots and lots of risk and exposure to
[36:28] accumulate Bitcoin. Like, I'm I'm not
[36:30] here for the most possible dollars or
[36:34] even Bitcoin I can possibly get. It's
[36:36] how can I accumulate as much Bitcoin as
[36:38] possible
[36:39] in a way that I retain control over that
[36:42] Bitcoin. And so the narrative, how you
[36:45] go about it, I think all that stuff
[36:46] matters. I think, again, I'll just
[36:48] reiterate this because I don't I know
[36:50] anytime you talk about Michael Sailor,
[36:51] if you if it's not just, you know, he's,
[36:53] you know, the new Bitcoin Jesus, I know
[36:56] you get just railed on. I think um what
[36:59] Michael Sailor is doing makes a lot of
[37:01] financial sense. I think that people
[37:04] should be very clear that they are
[37:05] buying a fiat product when they use any
[37:08] of his, you know, the offerings that
[37:10] strategy provides. And I think what most
[37:12] people should do is reorient themselves
[37:14] to the fact that what you're doing when
[37:15] you accumulate Bitcoin, like real
[37:17] Bitcoin in self-custody, is you're
[37:19] buying the money that we are betting the
[37:21] future uses, right? that we are we're
[37:24] we're accumulating this hard asset, this
[37:27] hard form of money that we'll be able to
[37:29] use, spend, save in, you know, in
[37:31] innumerable ways 20 years from now. And
[37:34] a lot of people are just unaware of the
[37:37] capital gains implications and the
[37:38] custodial implications and, you know,
[37:40] the fact that they're really just
[37:41] playing a fiat game and it just happens
[37:44] to be someone else buying Bitcoin quote
[37:45] unquote on their behalf, but not really
[37:47] because it's not yours. It's not an IOU.
[37:50] So there's just a lot of I think waking
[37:51] up around these narratives that people
[37:52] need to need to do. They really need to
[37:54] ask themselves why am I in Bitcoin? And
[37:56] if it's because of freedom and self-
[37:58] sovereignty and all the things that we
[37:59] talked about, you know, the cipher
[38:00] punks, then just buy Bitcoin. Take it
[38:02] into self-custody and and ignore awesome
[38:04] like cheer Sailor on for adopting a
[38:06] Bitcoin, you know, strategic reserve.
[38:08] And but it doesn't mean you have to play
[38:11] that game. Also,
 the first time I ever
[38:14] made any money, I got myself from that
[38:16] money a watch. And ever since then, I
[38:18] collect time pieces to remember times
[38:21] where I achieved some milestone. That's
[38:24] why I got the Bitcoin 2025 edition when
[38:27] I went to my first ever American Bitcoin
[38:30] conference. So for me, the Bitcoin
[38:32] watches from Coin Vichilan represents
[38:35] the time that we are living in. For
[38:36] every person that wears a Bitcoin watch,
[38:39] I know they are representing sound money
[38:43] to the outside world. Make sure to check
[38:46] out those amazing coin vigilante time
[38:48] pieces down in the descriptions. I love
[38:51] those watches so so much. Most people
[38:54] realize that way way way too late. If
[38:57] you have Bitcoin, you have to have a
[39:00] self-custody hardware wallet. But what
[39:02] are you doing if that hardware wallet
[39:04] breaks? Yeah, you wrote your seed phrase
[39:06] on paper. What if that paper is just
[39:09] dissolving or water spilled on top of
[39:12] it? paper is very very nondurable. So
[39:15] you have to have a fire resistant, water
[39:18] resistant and impact proof method of
[39:21] securing your seat phrase so you can
[39:24] back up your keys. And to do that you
[39:26] should use a solid titanium plate from
[39:30] stamp seed. Go to stampseed.com
[39:32] and use code robin to get not five or 10
[39:36] but 15% off your stamp seed. The most
[39:41] important thing for your Bitcoin journey
[39:44] is not buying Bitcoin, but it's how to
[39:47] keep them. And yes, you have maybe the
[39:49] right tools, but how do you actually go
[39:51] ahead and stick it all together so it's
[39:54] the most secure for you personally?
[39:56] Self-custody is a deeply personalized
[39:59] journey and the Bitcoin way is helping
[40:01] you exactly finding that correct setup
[40:05] for you personally. They're also helping
[40:07] you with securing your own cyber
[40:09] security. And if you want to go one step
[40:12] above all that, you can even get a
[40:15] consultation for a plan B residency. Go
[40:19] to the bitcoinway.com/roin
[40:23] and you will get a 30inut free
[40:26] consultation. I know how big of a hurdle
[40:28] it can be to have self-custody, but it's
[40:31] so freaking important to make that first
[40:34] step. We have to make sure it's as easy
[40:37] and simple as possible. And that's
[40:40] exactly what Bitbox did. Bitbox created
[40:43] the simplest and the easiest hardware
[40:46] wallet to use to get into self custody.
[40:49] So get yourself a Bitbox down from the
[40:52] link in the description. And when you
[40:53] use code Robin, you even get a 5%
[40:57] discount. you can like what people are
[41:00] doing with with the Bitcoin and with
[41:02] with their their games they're playing,
[41:04] but still choose to like, hey, I I stick
[41:07] with the most sovereignty most sovereign
[41:10] way because I know this is the the right
[41:13] side. This is the the safe side even. Um
[41:16] you you mentioned it. Why do you think
[41:18] differently about uh governments buying
[41:20] Bitcoin?
[41:22] Well, because the only way they can buy
[41:24] Bitcoin is through theft. Um and and
[41:26] just as a libertarian, I'm not a big fan
[41:28] of that. Uh you know, they they're going
[41:30] to print money or, you know, they talk
[41:32] about budget neutral ways, but we're
[41:33] already running what a $2 trillion
[41:35] deficit and they already are only funded
[41:37] by the fact that they're able to steal
[41:38] through taxes or inflation. The only
[41:41] people that they can the only way that
[41:42] they can accum the only way they could
[41:44] accumulate Bitcoin in a semifair way
[41:46] would be through mining. But even still,
[41:49] what's buying the AS6, right? Well,
[41:51] taxes or, you know, theft of some kind.
[41:54] And so, uh, I mean, I think just as
[41:57] practically as a libertarian, I I can't
[41:59] rationalize how how we support that. I
[42:02] think, um, you know, I think be beyond
[42:06] that, I the government has never done
[42:09] anything, you know, almost anything,
[42:11] right? And so, I don't know why
[42:13] supporting their acquisition of the the
[42:16] best form of money, uh, what I, you
[42:18] know, would prefer to be the people's
[42:19] money, uh, is is a productive exercise.
[42:24] Now, I've heard people make compelling
[42:27] cases, smart people make compelling
[42:29] cases for it. Um, but I think in
[42:31] general, the the whole point for me is
[42:33] it's an opt out. It's an opt out of it's
[42:35] a separation of money and state. It's
[42:36] the opt out of of everything. And my
[42:38] concern with government adoption of
[42:39] Bitcoin, even if they could do it in a
[42:40] way that wasn't theft, which I don't
[42:42] perceive to be truly possible, is does
[42:45] it then just become this digital Fort
[42:47] Knox just like gold has, and nothing in
[42:50] the world actually changes. Everyone
[42:52] gets wealthy because the price of gold
[42:54] goes up and now everyone gets wealthy
[42:55] because the price of Bitcoin goes up.
[42:57] And by everyone I mean a very small
[42:58] percentage of us who actually understand
[43:00] and own Bitcoin. Uh but no nothing about
[43:04] the world changes. The incentives don't
[43:06] change. Like we aren't our economy and
[43:08] society aren't realigned in in some
[43:12] meaningful way because of Bitcoin. It's
[43:14] just sitting there for lots and lots of
[43:16] people to you know maybe eventually sell
[43:18] off a little bit. But I think my yeah, I
[43:20] guess I would summarize my two biggest
[43:22] complaints is the only way that I see
[43:24] governments accumulating Bitcoin would
[43:26] be through some form of theft or use of
[43:29] you know swapping assets that they
[43:30] probably shouldn't have to begin with.
[43:33] Um, you know, or uh, you know, printing
[43:37] money and but I don't know there I think
[43:40] governments like I view government as
[43:42] the enemy. I don't view government as my
[43:44] friend. and the fact that they can pump
[43:45] my bags, which I'm fully aware of. They
[43:47] like they could make Bitcoin go to a
[43:48] million dollars if they started just
[43:50] buying it up and they sent, you know,
[43:51] kicked off the game theory and
[43:53] governments around the world were buying
[43:54] it. I would be much much much wealthier.
[43:58] But my son would not be safe from the
[44:02] prospect of a future war that he gets
[44:04] drafted to. And that's a big trade-off
[44:07] to make. Like my ultimate goal in life
[44:09] isn't exclusively wealth. I think that's
[44:11] coming. So, in the meantime, I want to
[44:13] push forward a narrative that that
[44:15] inspires people to think beyond that, to
[44:18] lower their time preference beyond their
[44:19] wealth and think about, you know, what
[44:22] what's the world I want my kids to grow
[44:24] up and what's the world I want to be
[44:25] exper I'm in my 30s. I've got hopefully
[44:28] a bit of a runway ahead of me when I'm
[44:30] 70. What world do I want to experience?
[44:32] And when I have my grandkids, what world
[44:33] do I want them to experience? and a
[44:36] bunch of stolen Bitcoin effectively
[44:38] sitting in a digital Fort Knox I don't
[44:40] think does any good for anyone
[44:42] necessarily.
 Interesting. I love that
[44:44] view because it's like
 what's your
[44:46] what's your take on the SPR?
 It I hope
[44:50] that that I count on the ignorance of
[44:55] governments through to new technology.
[44:59] Uh in the EU I can count on that a
[45:01] little bit more than in in America. Uh
[45:04] it seems like they they get it faster,
[45:07] but even now they have like they have a
[45:10] strategic Bitcoin reserve, but honestly
[45:13] they they just put a different name on
[45:14] the Bitcoin they already had.
 Yeah, for
[45:17] now that's true. Yeah.
 Till now it's not
[45:20] really till now it's not really
[45:22] anything. I mean there are some states
[45:24] that passes some bills. I'm not fully in
[45:27] informed on on how far they've gone and
[45:29] and if there are any states that already
[45:30] bought some Bitcoin or is it just uh
[45:33] rumors and and and and and some
[45:35] discussions currently going on.
[45:38] I and and we know um supposedly America
[45:43] holds a lot of gold.
[45:45] Maybe supposedly I don't know like if
[45:49] it's actually true or not. I cannot
[45:50] verify that. Uh, but if they want to do
[45:54] the same thing with Bitcoin, I mean, if
[45:56] they want to have the same amount of
[45:57] Bitcoin that they hold supposedly with
[46:00] with gold, that's a lot of Bitcoin. I
[46:02] don't know if it even could come to that
[46:04] because, as you say, if the word gets
[46:06] out and uh we know that America is
[46:09] buying Bitcoin, like actually
[46:11] aggressively trying to accumulate
[46:13] Bitcoin, I think the price just runs
[46:15] away uh very quickly. the same way as if
[46:19] I don't know Apple comes out tomorrow
[46:20] and puts a statement of like okay 10% of
[46:23] our balance sheet is already converted
[46:25] to Bitcoin I think the price just shoots
[46:27] up to like a million or like 500,000
[46:29] whatever the the the thing is so I count
[46:33] on if they adopt Bitcoin they might
[46:36] accumulate Bitcoin but they also kind of
[46:40] sign on the death of the money printer
[46:42] and long term they will lose the Bitcoin
[46:46] because the only way they can hold the
[46:48] Bitcoin if they get more Bitcoin.
[46:52] So, I don't know. Uh it's it it's really
[46:55] hard for me to to see a a world that is
[46:59] fully Bitcoin and a world where the
[47:02] government has a lot of power. So, I I
[47:05] don't know those two seem do not go good
[47:08] together. I think there there is room
[47:10] for service providers for uh central
[47:14] institutions that provide uh services
[47:18] where you pay a fee for that. I don't
[47:20] know like if there's a service that
[47:22] provides streets and and you pay for
[47:24] those streets to drive on. Um so you
[47:27] would call it a fee and not a tax
[47:29] because it's actually associated with an
[47:31] actual cost. Um and and that's where I I
[47:34] like that future. I I'm I'm very much uh
[47:38] subscribe to the sovereign individual uh
[47:40] that kind of future. Uh but yeah, it's I
[47:45] I think government uh I'm a fan of
[47:48] governments not buying Bitcoin. Uh but I
[47:51] don't know what happens if they
[47:52] aggressively buy Bitcoin because I
[47:54] cannot control if they buy or not. I I
[47:56] just wish they wouldn't. But the
[47:59] question is like if they do, what
[48:01] actually happens then?
 Yeah. And and and
[48:04] I don't know. The answer for me is I I
[48:06] don't know what happens. I I guess maybe
[48:08] the nuance I would add to all of my
[48:09] arguments is I think over some long
[48:12] enough time frame
[48:14] Bitcoin does win in the way that I think
[48:17] we want it to win that I'm a a better
[48:20] world kind of win. I think the question
[48:23] though so but like that's kind of
[48:25] meaningless if it's a hundred years from
[48:26] now and in between now and then tons of
[48:28] people continue to suffer and we have a
[48:30] you know 50 more wars and like all these
[48:33] things. Like my question is like what
[48:34] can we do to push and promote that like
[48:37] bring that prosperous future closer to
[48:39] the present and I think that you know uh
[48:45] using Bitcoin to pay down the debt maybe
[48:47] there's a good argument to be made that
[48:49] well they accumulate a bunch of Bitcoin
[48:50] they use it to pay down the debt and
[48:52] then that spreads the Bitcoin into the
[48:54] world in you know some useful way that
[48:56] people now have there's broad enough
[48:59] adoption of Bitcoin sort of forced upon
[49:02] uh these holders to use Bitcoin as money
[49:04] and it you know maybe but I think in the
[49:08] interim I think it sits probably as a
[49:11] digital Fort Knox and doesn't really get
[49:14] used and maybe some of the debts paid
[49:16] down but as long as the money printer
[49:18] still exists then there's no real
[49:19] incentive for the you know the forever
[49:22] wars to stop and uh you know the the
[49:25] incentives are just so broken I I I
[49:28] don't want and this is you know probably
[49:31] cognitive dissonance here is like I
[49:33] don't want the um the economy to
[49:36] collapse, but I don't I'm I'm I I
[49:39] struggle to see how how we get out of
[49:42] the mess that we're in even if
[49:44] governments are adopting Bitcoin. Um you
[49:47] know, there just there's so many
[49:49] variables at play, right? I think the
[49:51] people uh you know, like people at BPI
[49:53] who I think are are great people
[49:55] operating in good faith. Um, even though
[49:58] I don't necessarily disagree with their
[49:59] their stance on government accumulation
[50:01] of Bitcoin and the and certainly in
[50:04] aggregate they're much smarter than I am
[50:06] by myself, they can't they can't foresee
[50:09] all of the potential implications of
[50:11] what governments adopting Bitcoin means.
[50:13] Just like I can't, you know, conceive
[50:16] all of all the uh the implications of
[50:19] Bitcoin not being adopted by
[50:20] governments.
[50:22] uh you brought up, you know, like so so
[50:24] that's that's maybe one point you
[50:26] brought up. states adopting bit a bit
[50:27] Bitcoin strategic reserve. I think I
[50:29] think it was um like New Hampshire and
[50:31] maybe Arizona uh did end up getting it
[50:34] through.
[50:36] As a again as as a philosophically as a
[50:39] libertarian I think I'm as opposed to
[50:40] that as as any that said I think
[50:42] practically the closer that we can bring
[50:45] these determinations to home the better.
[50:47] And like that's why I think the
[50:49] individual, the family unit, like those
[50:51] are the those are the ultimate um
[50:54] entities to be making these decisions.
[50:57] It gets a it's a little bit worse, but
[50:59] still way better than the federal
[51:00] government making decisions if it's your
[51:02] your town or your local community or
[51:04] better yet even the subdivision, you
[51:06] know, like the you know, uh the people
[51:09] you live, you know, near. And then, you
[51:11] know, states are are worse, but still a
[51:14] lot better than the federal government.
[51:16] And it just sort of goes out like the
[51:18] closer these decisions about what what
[51:21] are we using for money? Uh how are we
[51:23] going to live our lives? The closer
[51:25] those decisions could be made to home, I
[51:27] think the better the world's going to
[51:28] be. And maybe my biggest concern with
[51:31] the like what are the ex the
[51:33] externalities of the federal government
[51:35] buying is the federal government has
[51:37] proven time and time again they're not
[51:38] operating in my best interest. And and
[51:41] also it's a bunch of crazy people. I
[51:43] mean, look, I look at Trump and Elon
[51:44] right now. Like, you know, I I thought
[51:46] we dodged a bullet that we didn't have
[51:47] Harris, you know, as as president and,
[51:50] you know, Tim Tim Walls as our VP, but
[51:55] the world it's not looking it's not
[51:56] looking awesome. Like, we got a bunch of
[51:58] like childish men bickering on on
[52:00] Twitter right now and accusing each
[52:02] other of things. And so I I am so
[52:04] distrustful the further from my my home
[52:07] that I get that the the more we can do
[52:09] to bring those decisions back to the
[52:11] individual the better. And so um part of
[52:15] it is I understand philosophical but I
[52:17] think part of it's also also practical.
[52:19] Um you know we we don't want the economy
[52:21] to collapse. I'm not really sure how
[52:23] exactly Bitcoin smooth that that
[52:25] transition but I think if it has a
[52:27] chance of doing so it's probably because
[52:29] individuals adopt it not because
[52:30] governments or large corporations do.
[52:32] But it's interesting how Elen reacted to
[52:34] the depth ceiling raising which was kind
[52:38] of like of course it happens like I
[52:41] don't know if anyone ever doubted that
[52:43] they don't raise it. Uh it's the only
[52:45] thing the Republicans and the Democrats
[52:47] actually agree on and that government
[52:50] will spend more money. it. I don't know
[52:53] if Elon Musk actually believed that he
[52:55] can reverse government spending. Like
[52:58] for me, this was so clear that they will
[53:01] spend more money than they make. Like h
[53:04] you can't undo that. The the system is
[53:06] too big for that. There needs to be a
[53:09] dictator and this dictator needs to be
[53:12] uh someone that is really really
[53:14] convinced of that and everyone has to
[53:17] play with him
[53:19] in order to for governments to spend
[53:21] less and actually get the the step down
[53:24] like otherwise that will just keep
[53:26] crying. So I think that's like almost a
[53:28] natural law.
 Yeah. Yeah. I man I don't I
[53:32] don't know what to make of uh of like
[53:34] Doge and and and all of that. I think
[53:38] Elon's a smart guy. I can't imagine that
[53:41] he went in really thinking that they
[53:42] were going to cut$ two trillion dollar.
[53:44] They were just going to eliminate the
[53:46] deficit, right? I mean, certainly he
[53:48] understood politics well enough to know
[53:50] that there's a massive voting block
[53:53] relying on social security, Medicare,
[53:55] Medicaid, who you like in that and
[53:57] that's what you have to cut in the DoD,
[54:00] right? like you've got um and like I say
[54:03] this as like a a former kind of
[54:05] conservative Republican type of guy.
[54:08] You've got a huge block of people who
[54:11] view the like the more we spend on
[54:13] military the better. Like that makes us
[54:15] more powerful. Never mind the fact that
[54:17] we could probably cut, you know,
[54:19] military spending by 80 or 90% and be
[54:21] ju, you know, go lean and efficient and
[54:23] be just as, you know, effective. Um, not
[54:26] that I want us to be so effective in our
[54:28] military presence, but you you'd think
[54:30] that someone like Musk would have
[54:32] understood that most of what you need to
[54:34] mess with is just completely politically
[54:36] off limits. Like you you you simply
[54:38] can't do anything about it. And uh but
[54:41] but to me that that's the hope of
[54:42] Bitcoin is, you know, before Bitcoin
[54:44] we're in this 37ish trillion dollar
[54:47] worth of debt. I don't know what you I
[54:49] mean, I guess I guess you run to gold,
[54:50] but like there's no real hope for a a
[54:53] brighter future on a gold standard in
[54:55] again in a digital global economy, but
[54:57] we have Bitcoin. Like, opt out. Like,
[54:59] just just say enough and buy some
[55:02] Bitcoin uh or earn in Bitcoin if you
[55:04] can. Sell a good service, you know,
[55:06] launch a podcast and accept Bitcoin as
[55:08] payment. Get get as much of it as you
[55:10] can and then just take it into
[55:12] self-custody. Like, don't leave it on
[55:14] the exchange. Don't trust it to someone
[55:15] else. Don't buy a paper product. Uh
[55:18] that's the beauty of it. So I I was we
[55:20] just recorded a podcast uh our inter
[55:22] like our internal show Bitcoin Banter
[55:24] and uh we were talking about the the
[55:26] Musk Trump divorce and uh Rick, one of
[55:29] our guys said he thinks that uh this was
[55:32] all just kind of a charade like they
[55:33] they knew this wasn't going to work and
[55:35] that they're and I don't know that I
[55:37] have a strong feeling about that but it
[55:39] wouldn't surprise me. I mean nothing
[55:40] would surprise me at this point. So,
[55:42] like did they know that Doge was going
[55:43] to fail and they now they have some
[55:45] scapegoat and we have to raise the debt
[55:47] ceiling and uh it's just they know they
[55:49] need to turn the money printers on or
[55:51] default in just absolute economic
[55:54] calamity. Uh this is, you know, this is
[55:56] going to be their excuse. We have to
[55:58] avoid economic catastrophe. We have to
[56:00] raise the debt ceiling to non-existence
[56:03] and and print and print and print. And I
[56:05] think that's why Larry Leard's book, The
[56:07] Big Print, is is one of my favorites. I
[56:09] think it really illustrates the absolute
[56:11] corruption of the system and uh and why
[56:14] like ultimately that's the his thesis is
[56:16] right that's what's going to play out
[56:19] 100%. And we mentioned Bitcoin Prague
[56:22] now so many many times. This podcast
[56:24] will actually come out while Bitcoin
[56:26] Prague is already going on. So for
[56:28] people not to be
 confused me on the main
[56:30] stage, guys.
[56:32] Uh and I'm really looking forward uh
[56:35] just as a side note, I will have in the
[56:37] VIP stage when this comes out yesterday,
[56:41] but like on on on Saturday or like on
[56:43] Friday uh at Bitcoin Prague um a
[56:46] fireside chat with Larry La. Uh, and I'm
[56:49] really looking forward to that because
[56:51] it's unrecorded and I feel like people
[56:54] are even a little bit more um relaxed
[56:58] and even giving a little bit more away
[57:00] when there's not the recording going on.
[57:03] And uh, Larry Le is anyone someone that
[57:07] just like doesn't sugarcoat it. So
[57:09] seeing him unrecorded, I think it will
[57:13] will be fun or was fun yesterday.
 Yeah.
[57:16] No, Larry is awesome. I was just on the
[57:18] phone with him this morning. We're
[57:19] trying to help him get some books to
[57:20] prog me saying this. We're trying to
[57:22] help him order books to sign in Prague.
[57:24] And uh I'll tell you what, Amazon is
[57:26] about as fiat as it gets. He's he's had
[57:28] a hell of a time doing that. And uh so
[57:30] we're trying to do what we can to make
[57:32] sure he's got books to sign when he gets
[57:34] there.
 Absolutely. Really really cool.
[57:36] And one last topic that I want to get
[57:38] into with you when time flew by um is
[57:42] oper and uh kind of internal wars that
[57:46] we have in in Bitcoin beat on the the
[57:49] technical side but those kind of things
[57:51] we we kind of mentioned the the the
[57:53] narrative wars before but and and I
[57:55] think like an interesting addition to
[57:57] that is like op return and and other
[58:00] discussions. I I'm I'm personally not a
[58:02] big expert on that. I think you also
[58:04] said like you're not super deep on the
[58:06] technical side, but I I feel like you
[58:08] have an opinion on that still.
 Yeah, I
[58:10] would say I have a halfbaked opinion and
[58:12] it's uh yeah, it's it's very much less
[58:15] technical in nature and so I you take
[58:17] anything I say with a grain of salt. Um
[58:19] so first of all, I would say that I look
[58:21] at sort of the two competing sides on
[58:23] this debate and I I ask my I'm sort of
[58:26] in a position where I have to trust and
[58:27] not verify because I'm not a developer.
[58:30] um and just don't understand the
[58:31] understand the intricacies of the
[58:32] protocol as well as I would like and
[58:34] hope to someday.
[58:37] I look at the fix the filters people and
[58:41] uh you know Bitcoin Mechanic and Matthew
[58:44] Crowder and uh there's sort of a list of
[58:47] them and I have learned a lot from that
[58:52] crew. Um not not exclusively about the
[58:54] the filters but just you know Bitcoin my
[58:57] understanding of Bitcoin.
[59:00] Um, and I look at the other side and
[59:02] they're, you know, a lot of them are
[59:03] dancing around in wizards hats or, you
[59:05] know, I think you probably tell which
[59:07] direction I'm heading with this. And so
[59:08] my inclination is to uh or or they
[59:11] support, you know, like very clearly to
[59:13] me, shitcoins.
[59:15] Um, or or they have a a vested financial
[59:18] interest in spamming the network, it
[59:20] seems, but I'm by my loose definition of
[59:22] the word spam. Again, like we can get
[59:24] into semantics. What does that mean? Um,
[59:26] so I I tend to be more of a fix the
[59:28] filters guy. I understand that u like
[59:31] the uh that operturn discussion is a
[59:34] meool policy issue. It's not you know
[59:36] what actually gets into the block is
[59:38] going to end up on your you know your
[59:39] node regardless. But I don't think that
[59:41] means we don't try plugging the holes as
[59:43] we go is sort of my general feeling. I
[59:45] think the other thing that I've had an
[59:46] issue with, and I know both sides are
[59:48] yelling at each other, and they probably
[59:49] people have said very stupid things in
[59:51] both directions,
[59:54] but I think maybe my maybe my biggest
[59:56] turnoff from the um pro removal of the
[59:59] oper limit side is the way that they've
[60:03] um that they've sort of addressed this
[60:06] as uh you know, like you're not a core
[60:10] developer and so you shouldn't have an
[60:12] opinion. And and to me that's a very
[60:15] dangerous position to take because it it
[60:18] it's sort of this effort to remove any
[60:20] any argument because you aren't the
[60:22] expert. And I think if there's anything
[60:24] I've learned in the last you know what 5
[60:26] years it's that I don't trust the
[60:28] experts. And the fact that you're a core
[60:30] developer does not make you an expert on
[60:31] money or monetary policy or macro. It
[60:34] doesn't mean that you suddenly have a
[60:35] crystal ball into the implications of
[60:37] the decisions you're making. And so for
[60:39] those reasons, I tend to be, you know,
[60:42] again, take it as a grain of salt, but
[60:44] something more of an oification
[60:46] person when it comes to the protocol. I
[60:49] understand that there is probably
[60:50] development that could be done to make
[60:53] Bitcoin more useful as money and as a
[60:55] medium of exchange. And um I'm in no way
[60:58] suggesting that that's not the case. But
[61:01] we're also at a point in Bitcoin's
[61:03] existence that there are millions and
[61:06] millions of people who not aren't
[61:08] necessarily Bitcoiners but are in some
[61:10] way uh you know through proxy like the
[61:13] ETFs or or you know they're invested in
[61:15] the NASDAQ and so they've got exposure
[61:17] to Micro Strategy or something. they're
[61:18] in some in some way sort of reliant on
[61:21] the reliability of the Bitcoin protocol.
[61:24] And so making changes without a full
[61:27] understanding of what the the long-term
[61:30] consequences of that is or of what those
[61:32] what they are, I think is dangerous. And
[61:36] I think I would say any change needs to
[61:39] be very very very conservative. And I
[61:42] think to the extent that you can, you
[61:44] know, Bitcoin's still a small enough,
[61:46] you know, ship in this ocean of uh, you
[61:49] know, global assets, the extent that we
[61:51] can still try to find some level of
[61:52] consensus about these changes being made
[61:55] is very helpful. I know you're never
[61:57] going to achieve perfect consensus. And
[61:59] I'm referring to consensus just an idea,
[62:01] not obviously consensus on the protocol.
[62:04] I think that that would be best to me.
[62:07] I've talked to very few people like at
[62:09] the conference on my podcast who are who
[62:14] are on who just have sided with the core
[62:16] developers honestly like most people are
[62:20] their view is Bitcoin is money and I'm
[62:22] unconvinced that this change is
[62:24] beneficial to the uh promotion of
[62:27] Bitcoin is money and to me that just
[62:30] doesn't seem like a risk worth taking
[62:32] and I don't think we just throw up our
[62:33] hands and give up and say well they're
[62:35] going to spam anyway we plug theole that
[62:37] we can and then we hope that the free
[62:39] market prices the spammers out uh in the
[62:43] in the long run. And I think that's
[62:44] probably likely to happen. Um but again,
[62:48] you know, it it's it's tough because I I
[62:50] just can't get into the the the
[62:51] technical details of it without, you
[62:53] know, being wrong or sounding like an
[62:55] idiot. Um but that that's sort of the
[62:57] way I'm sort approaching how I think
[62:59] about this.
[63:01] It's very similar to to to how I also
[63:03] think it's in general to any um and I
[63:07] mean I was a software developer
[63:09] beforehand but I wouldn't call myself an
[63:11] expert when it comes to software
[63:13] especially not to to Bitcoin you really
[63:15] have to study it very deeply to
[63:17] understand it but I always argue for any
[63:21] change like even outside of op return
[63:24] you have to have an extremely good
[63:26] reason why you change it and if you're
[63:29] in doubt hoped if it is good, it's
[63:32] probably better to keep it the way it is
[63:35] uh and make a conservative choice. So, I
[63:38] think we need probably down the road
[63:41] some changes to Bitcoin. Uh if we just
[63:45] keep it as it is and we never change
[63:47] anything, we probably run into uh
[63:50] problems in I don't know 10 years, 50
[63:52] years, 200 years, whatever. But the
[63:54] reason has to be so good and so critical
[64:00] that you're like, "Okay, we have to do
[64:02] this." Like it has to be almost obvious
[64:04] that we have to make that change. And
[64:06] that's how I view any any change. And I
[64:09] just haven't seen a compelling enough
[64:11] argument uh for for for that change. But
[64:14] yeah,
 the fact the fact that you've got
[64:16] smart people on both sides who are who
[64:18] disagree so vehemently about this to me
[64:20] indicates probably going conservative
[64:22] and not making the change makes a lot
[64:24] more sense. I think there are going to
[64:26] be changes and I know there will be
[64:28] fighting and that's is part of the
[64:29] beauty of of Bitcoin is that we we fight
[64:31] over things that we think are important.
[64:32] there will be fighting, but like when
[64:33] the quantum problem materializes, which
[64:36] you know, I'm not that's not like
[64:37] something I'm uh concerned about in the
[64:39] short term, but I let's presume that it
[64:42] is a problem at some point. I think
[64:44] there it'll be much easier to find
[64:46] consensus amongst people involved
[64:49] because it's, you know, potentially an
[64:51] existential threat to to the Bitcoin
[64:53] network. And uh I bet that gets rolled
[64:56] out a lot easier. In the meantime, these
[64:58] sorts of things where it's like, well,
[65:00] we want to, you know, play with the
[65:02] these op codes. Um, I would just say
[65:06] Bitcoin is not perfect and, uh, it's
[65:09] still working as money. Like, I mean,
[65:11] the Bitcoin way literally operates on a
[65:13] Bitcoin standard. We won't accept
[65:15] anything but Bitcoin. We won't pay you
[65:16] in anything but Bitcoin. They pay me in
[65:18] Bitcoin. Like, the like we operate on a
[65:21] Bitcoin standard. It does work. And we
[65:23] we primarily use onchain which I I know
[65:26] isn't like probably what the future
[65:28] holds because I think eventually people
[65:29] are going to be priced out of you know
[65:31] owning their own UTXOs and all that but
[65:33] there's lightning there's you know there
[65:34] there these other tools that people are
[65:36] already using and to me at least that
[65:39] gives me a lot of hope that we we can we
[65:42] can play conservative in the meantime
[65:44] and we don't need to make you know these
[65:46] sweeping changes that at least half and
[65:48] to me I perceive it to be much more than
[65:50] half of the you know the Bitcoin
[65:52] community and I know that's a a term
[65:53] people don't like that the Bitcoin
[65:55] community seems to resent and and uh and
[65:58] oppose. So yeah, play conservative.
[66:02] That's kind of my my hope especially
[66:04] with as much as as is on the line at the
[66:07] moment with um you know with I mean
[66:10] nation states and you know Wall Street
[66:12] getting here. There are a lot of people
[66:13] who are going to be touched by Bitcoin
[66:15] in some way that you know weren't a few
[66:17] years ago.
[66:19] I very much agree with that. Um, I have
[66:22] one question to ask each and every one
[66:23] of my guests and the question is, "What
[66:25] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin?"
[66:28] Oh boy. What can you learn from Man.
[66:30] Well, I've got So, the question I always
[66:32] ask at the end of my podcast is give me
[66:34] an unpopular opinion that you have. Um,
[66:36] so I'm trying to think of like what's uh
[66:38] what's something that uh I could share
[66:40] that's maybe a little bit controversial
[66:42] beyond Bitcoin. Besides understanding
[66:44] Bitcoin, one of the things I am most
[66:46] proud of is my family. And um I have I
[66:50] have three beautiful kids, a beautiful
[66:52] wife, and I uh can assure you I'm not a
[66:56] perfect husband or a perfect father. One
[66:58] of the things that I've learned though
[67:00] um parenting is that uh it's a very low
[67:05] time preference thing and if you do it
[67:08] right. And so the what I always tell
[67:11] people to the extent that they're
[67:12] interested in my opinion on parenting is
[67:14] discipline hard and love harder. And I
[67:18] think that a lot of people, this 21st
[67:20] century mentality of, you know, gentle
[67:22] gentle parenting and, you know, you
[67:24] don't want to offend your kids and blah
[67:26] blah blah, I think is nonsense. I think
[67:28] you need to uh you need to um instill a
[67:32] sense of discipline in them and you do
[67:34] that at a very young age. And then if
[67:36] you're doing it right, my experience has
[67:38] been 5 minutes later your kids are
[67:39] running back to you to play and be
[67:41] cuddled and and that sort of thing. So I
[67:43] think the maybe hopefully my takeaway
[67:45] would be that uh you know if you can
[67:48] learn one other thing from me it's that
[67:50] uh parenting is low time preference love
[67:52] is important but so is discipline.
 I
[67:55] love that discipline hard love harder.
[67:58] That's amazing.
 That's my mantra.
 Uh
[68:01] really cool. We have an end in the
[68:02] podcast where the previous guest is
[68:03] asking a question for the next guest
[68:04] without knowing who the next guest
[68:06] actually is and the previous guest asks
[68:08] you the question what is the most random
[68:10] thing you have ever collected? the most
[68:13] random thing I've ever collected.
[68:16] Let's see. I don't know if this counts.
[68:19] When when I was a kid, my my brother and
[68:21] I had like a a nice little snake
[68:23] collection going. We played outside a
[68:24] lot and we'd catch these little garter
[68:25] snakes and we probably had five or six
[68:27] of them at once and then one of them
[68:29] would die after a while because we
[68:30] didn't know how to feed them or anything
[68:31] and then a new one come along and we'd
[68:33] add them to the collection. So, that's
[68:35] the first thing that comes to mind.
[68:38] That is very random. I love that.
[68:41] Dan, thank you so much. uh Michael for
