[00:00] There's a lot more to what we can do
[00:02] when we have like a nuclear reactor
[00:03] supporting Bitcoin mining financed by
[00:05] Bitcoin and then also like facilitating
[00:08] flows and payments as well. Oh, it's
[00:10] such an effective tool. Like there is
[00:12] literally power plants that have just
[00:14] like a resistive heater, just a large
[00:16] load bank of resistive heaters to take
[00:18] excess load. That is all we are
[00:20] proposing to do is replace technologies
[00:22] like that with Bitcoin miners. the
[00:24] interest in nuclear power has been
[00:25] reinvigorated but there's a lot of
[00:26] catching up to do especially on in the
[00:28] west on the supply chain and the labor
[00:30] fronts whereas in the east we're seeing
[00:32] Russia China India they're actively
[00:35] building nuclear reactors they've
[00:36] sustained their capabilities and they're
[00:38] enhancing them every day and when is the
[00:40] time going to come when we start
[00:41] measuring energy in like sats per
[00:44] kilowatt hour that's going to be an
[00:45] interesting transition I'm going to take
[00:47] those two time points and I'm going to
[00:48] put in what did it cost at Bitcoin at
[00:50] that point and if you measured it in
[00:52] terms of Bitcoin cost went down by 30%.
[00:54] In the summer, you're only using 5
[00:56] megawatt. So, for a lot of the year, if
[00:58] you have 10 megawatts of nuclear power
[00:59] installed, you can go as low as only
[01:01] needing 5 megawatt. You have to find
[01:02] something that can fill in that margin.
[01:04] So, Bitcoin mining isn't the ideal
[01:06] candidate to do that.
[01:09] [Music]
[01:11] Before we get into that, maybe uh give
[01:14] the viewers or the listeners some quick
[01:16] overview of like who you are and and why
[01:18] you're excited about Bitcoin.
 So, hey
[01:20] everyone. This is uh my second time here
[01:22] speaking with Robin and uh my name is
[01:24] Ryan Mloud. I'm a chemical technologist
[01:27] that works in the nuclear industry
[01:28] particularly at uh Canadian nuclear
[01:30] laboratories where I support various uh
[01:33] research and safety and monitoring
[01:35] programs for the Kand do reactor fleet
[01:38] which basically is Canada's unique uh
[01:41] reactor type that we have was invented
[01:43] here in Canada and it uh has a unique
[01:47] feature that it doesn't require enriched
[01:48] uranium which is one of the reasons why
[01:51] it has is considered a very like safe
[01:55] and high-quality technology that uh is
[01:59] has been deployed several places around
[02:01] the world but Canada we kind of stopped
[02:04] building them after the turn of reactor
[02:07] in Romania back in the about 2003 I
[02:10] think was the last can do reactor that
[02:11] was built but anyways my job is is
[02:13] supporting various uh activities that
[02:15] that monitor the health and status of
[02:17] those reactors and while I do that I
[02:20] operate a bunch of machines that allow
[02:22] me to listen to podcasts while I work so
[02:24] I listen to Bitcoin and then learned
[02:26] more about uh the broader nuclear
[02:28] landscape and the challenges that it
[02:30] faces especially when uh nuclear power
[02:33] is looking into deploying uh a
[02:35] technology called small modular reactors
[02:37] that are smaller reactors that can apply
[02:39] to smaller markets but the challenge is
[02:41] making sure that uh they can be
[02:43] costefficient and they can have enough
[02:46] demand where they're deployed to support
[02:47] them economically. So, I've taken a lot
[02:50] of interest in that area of nuclear um
[02:53] nuclear economics and applying Bitcoin
[02:55] to it in my spare time while I yeah
[02:58] listen to podcasts doing my job.
[03:01] Awesome. Yeah. You even like I saw um
[03:03] you gave a talk at El Salvador where we
[03:06] we met uh I mean it's like already half
[03:09] a year ago. It's the time flies by so
[03:11] quickly. you're doing a lot of are you
[03:13] also doing a lot of talks and and seeing
[03:16] uh what is developing with with Bitcoin
[03:18] mining and nuclear?
[03:20] Yeah, I pay a lot of attention to stuff
[03:23] going on in the new the Bitcoin mining
[03:25] space to stay apprised of like how
[03:27] quickly that is maturing in these
[03:29] different markets where um like evolving
[03:32] and how it's being used in the air
[03:34] market for load balancing, how it's
[03:35] being used in northern communities for
[03:38] for heat reuse and seeing how the like
[03:42] the form factors are maturing for more
[03:44] standard data centers, how it's just how
[03:46] all of this is kind of coming together
[03:49] in a that is going to be a lot more
[03:52] accommodating to a typically riskaverse
[03:54] sector like nuclear power to bring them
[03:57] together cuz the the way that Bitcoin
[04:01] mining was done a little more like
[04:02] cowboy style is doesn't jive well with
[04:05] with the uh the way that nuclear power
[04:07] is done very safe very regimented very
[04:09] bureaucratic and it's going to require a
[04:12] lot more maturity in these markets which
[04:14] now we're seeing with with um a lot of
[04:17] the uh developments that basically of
[04:20] the talks from at the uh Texas Energy
[04:23] and Mining Summit and the Nashville
[04:24] Energy and Mining Summit where they're
[04:25] actually having policy makers and grid
[04:27] managers talking about how they're using
[04:30] this technology and Bitcoin mining's
[04:32] flexibility to incorporate into their
[04:34] their grids and make it more economical
[04:36] and make it more resilient and more
[04:38] reliable power systems for their
[04:40] customers and taking the lessons that
[04:42] they're learning and molding it into a
[04:45] vision of how we can start applying that
[04:46] to nuclear power. And then on the flip
[04:48] side, I'm paying attention to a lot of
[04:49] the developments in nuclear power. How
[04:51] how it's getting a lot more attention
[04:52] now. How lots of countries want to
[04:54] continue building big reactors. AI is
[04:56] looking for a lot of power. So that's
[04:58] getting a lot more attention for the
[04:59] type of power load that nuclear power
[05:01] can offer. But then there's also the
[05:02] small reactors. So there's a lot of
[05:04] multi-prongs that uh I'm paying
[05:06] attention to and seeing a lot of synergy
[05:10] and places where Bitcoin and nuclear
[05:12] power will work very well together,
[05:14] especially on like mining and then
[05:16] capital formation and capital
[05:18] preservation are three like really good
[05:21] uh places that Bitcoin is going to apply
[05:24] to supporting nuclear power going
[05:26] forward. And that's where my attention
[05:28] is.
 Interesting. is like mixing of this
[05:31] cowboy Bitcoin mining with this highly
[05:33] regulated uh nuclear energy industry. I
[05:37] never looked at that way. Interesting.
[05:39] It's yeah the convergence are starting
[05:41] to happen like when we're seeing
[05:42] companies like Terra Wolf uh working
[05:44] with the Susuana power reactor in that
[05:47] area and selling that uh that data
[05:50] center that they were working on to
[05:51] Amazon and then the AI companies like
[05:54] Microsoft purchasing 3M islands reactor
[05:56] outright because they want all of that
[05:58] power to support a data center and
[06:00] there's just a lot of talk about the
[06:03] just the astonishing demand for power
[06:06] that is coming from these new computing
[06:08] techn technologies that we needed the
[06:11] power to be available like yesterday and
[06:14] we kind of dropped the ball and we
[06:15] hadn't been
[06:17] good like stewardship of this technology
[06:19] over the last two decades. like nuclear
[06:21] power up until about 2021, like late in
[06:24] the year, early 2022, was still kind of
[06:27] looked down upon as as just
[06:31] not the type of technology that could do
[06:36] it cost efficiently and in time for
[06:38] saving us from climate change. So the
[06:41] pay the attention has been subsidizing a
[06:43] lot of wind and solar infrastructure at
[06:45] the expense of not of not uh supporting
[06:48] nuclear infrastructure as heavily. So,
[06:50] it's created like supply chain gaps and
[06:54] um like labor gaps like when there isn't
[06:57] enough interest in the technology. It
[06:59] doesn't attract talent to the to be
[07:01] educated in nuclear technology. So,
[07:03] you're not bringing as many people
[07:04] through the the ed the school system and
[07:06] getting them trained as nuclear
[07:07] engineers as like high highderee labor
[07:10] that and uh tradesmen that we need to
[07:14] build these projects. So there's a lot
[07:16] of recovery on that front that needs to
[07:17] happen when you uh yeah when it doesn't
[07:19] get sustained very well over the years
[07:21] and you have like the basically there's
[07:23] bull and bare markets in the nuclear
[07:25] sector but they can last well over a
[07:27] decade as we've seen like since
[07:29] Fukushima and now only in the last 3
[07:31] years that there's the interest in
[07:33] nuclear power has been reinvigorated but
[07:35] there's a lot of catching up to do
[07:36] especially on in the west on the supply
[07:39] chain and the labor fronts whereas in
[07:41] the east we're seeing Russia and China
[07:43] and India they're actively building
[07:45] nuclear reactors. They've sustained
[07:47] their capabilities and they're enhancing
[07:49] them every day and getting better and
[07:51] more efficient and at uh doing this and
[07:54] if yeah if we don't get our act together
[07:56] in Europe and the west with uh deploying
[07:58] these technologies to the rest of the
[07:59] world the uh Russia and China are going
[08:02] to beat us to it and they're going to
[08:03] eat our lunch and it seems to be that
[08:05] that is the trajectory that we are on
[08:06] unless uh yeah unless we can turn the
[08:09] ship around real quick. That's I also
[08:11] want to get a little bit to like will we
[08:13] have in the future too much energy and
[08:15] and the this debate I think Gary Kadon
[08:18] was it that that said like uh there will
[08:21] be free electricity at some at some
[08:23] point because we have so much
[08:24] electricity but I want to first get a
[08:26] little bit uh one step behind and saying
[08:29] like why is nuclear and bitcoin such a a
[08:33] great matchuh for each other? I mean
[08:34] you're you're you're literally a nuclear
[08:36] Bitcoin. I I love the the wording. So
[08:38] it's a perfect question.
 Yeah, it all
[08:41] started about four years ago. So I can
[08:44] say that I've done my my four year first
[08:46] four year cycle at uh and it wrapped up
[08:49] around the time of the conference cuz it
[08:50] was when the first conference was
[08:52] happening whenever nuclear power got
[08:54] talked up in the brought up in the
[08:56] context of Bitcoin mining. It was within
[08:59] the context of reactors have been
[09:01] shutting down. Germany shutting down
[09:02] their fleet. Several reactors in the
[09:04] United States had been shut down
[09:05] recently. the the Vogle reactor had been
[09:08] taking 10 plus years and it was only
[09:10] just getting finished and there's
[09:11] another the uh the project in Finland
[09:14] that was also just recently finished
[09:16] that are way over budget way over
[09:18] expected time so it's puts a kind of a a
[09:21] stain on the perspective of the industry
[09:23] so I had been aware of the like the the
[09:28] action plans that Canada and other
[09:29] countries are putting together to uh
[09:31] deploy and develop a lot of the small
[09:33] modular reactor technologies the intent
[09:35] is that they'll be able to be smaller
[09:38] modularized container uh deployable like
[09:42] built mass-producing factories similar
[09:44] to how we build aircraft and like uh
[09:46] large um cargo ships and whatnot. So,
[09:49] it'll just be an assembly line where we
[09:50] can build the reactors and they can be
[09:52] quickly deployed and then that will
[09:55] start uh upgrading many of like remote
[09:57] communities and smaller grids off of the
[09:59] hydrocarbons and displace those to
[10:01] higher order uses because we're never
[10:02] going to stop using hydrocarbons. If we
[10:04] just stop using them for electricity, we
[10:06] will be able to use them for for more
[10:08] things like like hydrogen production,
[10:09] for synthetic fuels and all of that
[10:11] stuff. But I see
[10:14] this playing out kind of like the
[10:16] pioneer species that Brandon Quiddin has
[10:18] uh written about. And the idea is that
[10:21] these SMRs in many locations that we
[10:24] want to build them, the markets aren't
[10:26] typically big enough to support nuclear
[10:27] power. So we can use Bitcoin mining as
[10:31] an always available, perfectly scaled
[10:34] load that can match any SMR deployment
[10:37] to any location, no matter how remote,
[10:39] whether it's a few few megawatts or a
[10:41] few hundred megawatts that we're dealing
[10:43] with. And then the one of the key
[10:45] unlocks that Bitcoin mining allows for
[10:47] is that we can treat nuclear power not
[10:49] just as base load power which is what is
[10:52] typically done because it we want to
[10:54] always have the nuclear power being
[10:56] consumed 100% of it 24/7. If we need to
[10:59] start um like flexing its load and
[11:02] curtailing its load, it starts affecting
[11:04] the economics negatively. So we want to
[11:06] be able to sell all that power all the
[11:08] time. But typically when you're
[11:10] deploying power to a remote community,
[11:12] you're going to have some variance
[11:13] between their peak demand and their
[11:14] their base load demands. And it's in
[11:16] many cases it can be almost like half
[11:18] the load. You could be using as much as
[11:20] needing 10 megawatts at your like most
[11:22] extreme coldest day of the year. But
[11:24] then in the summer you're only using 5
[11:26] megawatt. So for a lot of the year, if
[11:28] you have 10 megawatts of nuclear power
[11:29] installed, but you're you can go as low
[11:32] as only needing 5 megawatt, you have to
[11:34] find something that can fill in that
[11:35] margin. And there aren't that many
[11:38] flexible loads that can just fill that
[11:40] margin anywhere we want in the world. So
[11:43] Bitcoin mining isn't the ideal candidate
[11:44] to do that is you don't necessarily have
[11:47] to have the top-of-the-line miners. You
[11:49] can have something that's a little bit
[11:51] older that's a little bit more tolerant
[11:53] to disruption uh in regards to their
[11:55] economics. Um, and then the key unlock
[11:58] is now we can think about building them
[12:00] bigger because if now we can build to
[12:02] peak load, we can build to excess future
[12:05] loads that we're considering. If we're
[12:07] expecting a community or an industrial
[12:08] site to grow or like expand its
[12:10] infrastructure and connect transmission
[12:12] lines to more communities and then as
[12:14] you're adding more local demand, you can
[12:17] offload your Bitcoin mining capacity to
[12:20] another facility and you can kind of
[12:22] like cascade that together. And as one
[12:25] one of these nodes first matures, then
[12:27] you can redeploy into the next node and
[12:30] then into the next node as they they
[12:32] they start becoming more just um
[12:35] accommodating for higher order power
[12:38] users like as yeah the Bitcoin mining
[12:40] comes in first and then within like the
[12:42] first year you you have like a water
[12:43] treatment center then you you've got to
[12:45] service your hospitals then you start
[12:46] having heavy industry and all of this
[12:48] starts displacing the Bitcoin miners
[12:50] because they they will be higher on the
[12:52] uh the stack of of energy utility uses.
[12:55] It's basically just kind of like if you
[12:57] use the the marginal utility argument
[12:59] like the Bitcoin miners are the first of
[13:00] the stack that will relinquish their
[13:02] power when it's needed by something
[13:04] higher in the community. And it's is
[13:06] basically exactly I want to play out
[13:07] exactly what Gridless is doing except I
[13:09] want to use it for SMRs and I want to
[13:12] wrap it around the the action plan that
[13:15] Canada has for this technology. And
[13:16] that's one of the biggest way first ways
[13:18] that I started seeing this opportunity
[13:20] and I've started putting that forward.
[13:21] Now we're starting to see things like
[13:23] these uh the Bitcoin treasury companies
[13:25] and nuclear power companies and these
[13:28] vendors. There's a lot of periods of
[13:29] time where it's kind of you're sitting
[13:31] on idle capital waiting for like a
[13:33] licensing procedure to happen before you
[13:35] can start construction. So and then
[13:38] there's even periods where like you have
[13:39] to consider waste and remediation and
[13:42] decommissioning at the end of life of
[13:43] these things. So, you're going to have
[13:44] to be um saving capital for that time
[13:48] that's 40 60 years in the future and you
[13:50] want to be able to preserve it. So, I'm
[13:52] al also arguing that Bitcoin should be
[13:53] part of those funds to to preserve that
[13:56] capital long into the future and support
[13:58] those um endeavors. And then now we've
[14:01] got things like the the bit bonds. And
[14:02] that might be an interesting way for
[14:05] these uh vendors that want to build this
[14:08] SMR technology to raise capital and have
[14:12] that Bitcoin alongside of it to make it
[14:16] just just make it more economically
[14:18] feasible so that they outside and reduce
[14:21] the dependence on like state sponsorship
[14:23] and loan guarantees. I think that
[14:26] there's there's something there that
[14:27] that can work, but all of these elements
[14:30] kind of like play together because then
[14:31] you can even have the mining feeds into
[14:33] servicing the debt coupons and you can
[14:36] have like a a Bitcoin flow and and a
[14:39] cash flow to service different tanches
[14:41] of investors and it can get kind of
[14:43] interesting and I'm hoping to get an
[14:44] opportunity to talk to some of the
[14:46] people that are more immersed in this um
[14:48] to work out some to to flesh out these
[14:51] ideas better cuz I I'm not a structured
[14:54] finance
[14:54] expert in any way. So, I would like to
[14:57] speak with one so that we can uh see if
[14:59] there's any way that we can make a
[15:01] product like this feasible for a company
[15:02] that's trying to build this technology
[15:04] cuz I think there's like having energy
[15:07] companies, an energy infrastructure
[15:09] companies with like a Bitcoin strategy
[15:12] is going to be a lot more interesting
[15:13] than like a hotel company like
[15:15] MetaPlanet. like I I I love what they're
[15:17] doing, but I think there's a lot more to
[15:19] what we can do when we have like a
[15:21] nuclear reactor supporting Bitcoin
[15:23] mining financed by Bitcoin and then also
[15:26] like facilitating like flows and
[15:28] payments as well cuz I I don't know if
[15:31] you've spoken with Bob Bernett or
[15:32] listened to much of his podcast, but he
[15:33] has these ideas about how block space is
[15:36] going to be a commodity and then so we
[15:38] can start thinking about it in that way.
[15:40] If you're if you own the power plant,
[15:42] you own Bitcoin mining, and then you're
[15:43] also trading blockbased commodities to
[15:45] financial institutions and and like it's
[15:47] all maturing and starting to come
[15:49] together, but it's going to require some
[15:51] some intrepid pioneers that are
[15:54] adventurous and a little more
[15:56] risk-taking in the nuclear space where
[15:59] typically everything is very riskaverse
[16:01] and trying to to minimize any
[16:04] uncertainty and any like any any
[16:08] negative perceptions of the technology.
[16:10] And there's definitely people in the
[16:12] nuclear space that see Bitcoin still as
[16:14] the but it's for criminals and it uses
[16:17] too much energy argument. So, so there
[16:19] is definitely some some education to
[16:21] work through to overcome some of those
[16:23] uh
[16:24] barriers, but we will get there.
 For me,
[16:28] energy companies seem to have one of the
[16:31] biggest future potentials for embracing
[16:33] Bitcoin. It it it's like it would be a
[16:36] no-brainer if if they are partnering up
[16:38] even like like even if they don't do
[16:40] structured finance products which I
[16:42] think is a great idea but just like
[16:45] using Bitcoin mining for all sorts of
[16:49] things that they're doing. I think this
[16:50] is a is a great thing and we have heard
[16:52] it I think ma multiple times on on the
[16:55] podcast from multiple people from Lisa
[16:58] from Paponat from from other people from
[17:01] Chris Gger from Terra Hesh from of
[17:04] Germany uh recently so so many people
[17:06] mentioned that like energy companies are
[17:09] are primed to embrace Bitcoin because it
[17:11] solves a real real problems from them
[17:14] even if they don't like Bitcoin even if
[17:17] they don't like Bitcoin they could still
[17:18] use Bitcoin mining
[17:19] Oh, it's such an effective tool. Like
[17:21] there is literally power plants that
[17:23] have just like a resistive heater, just
[17:25] a large load bank of resistive heaters
[17:28] to take excess load. And like that is
[17:30] all we are proposing to do is replace
[17:32] technologies like that with Bitcoin
[17:34] miners. And like I've been working on uh
[17:36] a model myself that that compares these
[17:39] things and it and it shows that if you
[17:41] have the option to to sell power like
[17:44] even at a few cents a kilowatt hour, it
[17:47] the model almost always chooses to sell
[17:50] it instead of like storing it in
[17:51] batteries and displacing that it um like
[17:54] arbitrageing it from low per low demand
[17:56] periods to high demand periods. it
[17:58] typically wants to just sell that power
[18:00] as much as possible and then you cycle
[18:02] that in to paying for upgrades to the
[18:05] grid and refinancing and the
[18:07] infrastructure and it almost becomes
[18:09] like self-perpetuating how we can
[18:11] recycle it into each other and then yeah
[18:13] and then we see other ways that the
[18:16] Bitcoin mining is being used from for
[18:18] like heat reuse like there's entire
[18:20] communities in Finland with tens of
[18:22] thousands of people that just they
[18:24] replace their electric heaters were just
[18:27] boil heating water and sending it to a
[18:29] community and that's now been replaced
[18:31] by Bitcoin miners. Like the entire
[18:32] province of Quebec here is they're
[18:34] pretty much all electric heat and they
[18:36] are blessed with abundant hydro power.
[18:39] So there's no excuse that they couldn't
[18:41] start transitioning over to using more
[18:42] Bitcoin mining for heat. And then like
[18:44] out in Vancouver, there's a company
[18:45] called Mint Green that's doing similar.
[18:47] They're they're finishing whiskey as
[18:49] with the the Bitcoin mining heat like
[18:52] drying logs. Just I've got an S9 behind
[18:55] me that I use as a space heater in the
[18:56] winter. I think that's going to be an
[18:58] added value stream. And then just like
[19:00] the fact that they have that flexibility
[19:02] and they're able to absorb capacity that
[19:06] would otherwise get wasted. Like we we
[19:08] set the floor at 4 cents a kilowatt
[19:10] hour. Like even if you're running S9's,
[19:12] it's like 2 cents a kilowatt hour that
[19:15] would otherwise not be made back. But
[19:18] now we have like the higherend A6,
[19:20] right? Sounds like we're getting sub 10
[19:22] jewels per terahash. That's uh like if
[19:25] you just plug that into a wall, you're
[19:28] getting almost 20 cents a kilowatt hour
[19:30] out of that. Even even at the low hash
[19:32] prices that we're we're having right
[19:34] now, like I think we're at like $50 per
[19:36] pahash per day, which is like where the
[19:40] margins of the all the miners out there
[19:42] start to get razor thin. So it it is
[19:44] interesting to start seeing the the
[19:45] dynamic like the price goes down and
[19:47] then the difficulty starts changing and
[19:49] we just the network adjusts and it moves
[19:51] on and we yeah we we all are all
[19:56] participating in its development and its
[19:58] evolution and how we're fitting into
[20:01] these different systems, power systems,
[20:02] heating systems. It's
[20:06] yeah, it's uh it's it it it's so big
[20:09] that Yeah. Sometimes like I I you start
[20:11] thinking about how big it can be and you
[20:14] get too far into the future and you're
[20:15] like we have to think about what's going
[20:17] on now. But yeah, cuz I I've let my my
[20:19] head get a little too far in the future
[20:20] with this nuclear stuff cuz I'm trying
[20:22] to set up the pieces for when we finally
[20:24] get these SMRs going in the next 3 to
[20:26] four years that this is like where it
[20:28] could be. and like the advancements that
[20:29] have happened in the last 4 years, even
[20:31] just since starting to pay attention to
[20:32] this, like this is going to be a
[20:34] revolutionary change, but the problem is
[20:37] is the markets that it's changing are so
[20:40] are typically very slowm moving. So,
[20:42] it's it it's not happening everywhere
[20:45] all at once, but it's is happening and
[20:48] it is starting to put the puzzle pieces
[20:50] together in a way that it's undeniable
[20:53] at this point that we are going to uh
[20:56] yeah, we're we're we're witnessing a
[20:57] fundamental change to our energy systems
[20:59] and our financial systems and the entire
[21:01] global order is uh up for grabs right
[21:04] now and Bitcoin seems to be at the
[21:05] center of it and it's uh it's very fun
[21:08] to be a part of it.
 It's it's really
[21:10] fun. It's like we have this energy
[21:14] revolution, we have Bitcoin, with the
[21:16] financial revolution, we even have AI
[21:18] which completely reolutionizes how we
[21:20] work and and how how we how we uh find
[21:24] information and how we process
[21:25] information. I mean we like we how we
[21:27] deploy workforce. The the perfect
[21:30] summary for me is always like what a
[21:31] time to be alive
[21:33] in general.
 Oh, it's wild. especially
[21:36] like yeah you're a bit younger than me
[21:37] but I'm I still remember the time before
[21:39] the internet was everywhere and like
[21:41] going outside was a lot more more common
[21:43] and now it's like now you have to go
[21:45] outside to escape the the digital world
[21:48] and it's almost flipped like it was was
[21:50] it was an escape for a while but now
[21:52] it's become overwhelming and part of our
[21:54] lives that like yeah the AI stuff is
[21:57] amazing like I I use it quite a bit like
[21:59] I I don't even Google anymore like my
[22:01] first instinct is just ask the question
[22:02] to the AI and it'll give me a far more
[22:06] concise and organized answer for the
[22:09] questions that I have. And then and then
[22:11] before you know it, you're having a
[22:12] full-on conversation about all these
[22:15] random ideas about like books you're
[22:17] reading about like ideas that you heard
[22:18] of just something just comes up randomly
[22:21] on a podcast and just this thought you
[22:23] just like just plug it into the AI and
[22:24] you'll get to it better back to it
[22:26] later. or if it's something that's
[22:28] deeper, you send it for deep research
[22:29] and it goes comes back 30 30 minutes
[22:31] later with like a PhD level dissertation
[22:34] about whatever the hell you wanted to
[22:35] learn about. And it is interesting
[22:38] seeing people that aren't kind aren't
[22:39] keeping up with it. Like you you use it
[22:41] a lot, so you kind of see that it's it's
[22:43] improving so quickly and it's making
[22:45] mistakes less and less. But there's
[22:47] there's people that used it earlier that
[22:48] were like, "Oh, it's making mistakes.
[22:50] It'll never work." And then they kind of
[22:51] just like let it go. But then you try to
[22:54] explain to them like, "Yes, like this AI
[22:55] is doing this stuff." Like you person
[22:57] that's never coded before, you can just
[22:59] tell the robot what you want and it will
[23:01] make code for you. You the barrier to
[23:04] entry for coding is now like so low that
[23:06] even my wife would be able to do it. And
[23:08] she's never like touched coding before
[23:10] in her life. And it's remarkable what it
[23:14] is going to unlock for people that are
[23:16] actually have the wherewithal and to to
[23:19] see where it's going and prepare
[23:22] themselves for it and actually that they
[23:23] like gain experience
[23:26] adapting to a world where this exists
[23:27] now cuz it's not going away and we might
[23:29] as well learn how to use it productively
[23:31] and adapt to it while while we can cuz
[23:35] it's going to be another thing like
[23:37] Bitcoin where whoever adapts to it
[23:39] earlier is going to be at such an
[23:41] asymmetric advantage to those that don't
[23:42] that it's like we're almost going to
[23:44] start diverging into like different
[23:46] species that people people that use the
[23:49] robots and people that don't. And it's
[23:51] going to be there's going to be some
[23:52] divergences
[23:54] and people that like yeah that
[23:56] completely reject it and people that go
[23:58] all in on it that and yeah, it's going
[24:00] to get weird. But uh yeah, let's enjoy
[24:03] the ride.
 Some people feel like oh like
[24:06] it's a new thing. It's like yeah like
[24:08] you can play around with it but you you
[24:10] don't really can do anything specific
[24:12] with it and probably most of my audience
[24:16] disagrees with that but uh um I think
[24:18] most of them already like embrace uh AI
[24:21] also as they embrace Bitcoin. Um but I
[24:24] want to bring that one example up. I
[24:26] heard Sailor talking at Vegas and later
[24:28] I heard something more interest even
[24:30] more interesting. He said before he goes
[24:32] to his and he has like thousands of
[24:34] lawyers and and and people that work for
[24:35] him, but before he goes to anyone, he
[24:38] put goes to AI, puts in all the
[24:41] situational and context things that he
[24:43] has and then goes into deep think mode
[24:46] and then lets it work and then interacts
[24:48] with it and then comes up with a plan
[24:50] what he wants to do. And then only when
[24:51] he has already made plan and made up his
[24:54] mind what he wants to do, then he goes
[24:56] to the lawyer and puts it in execution
[24:57] mode. and uh he has preferred stock
[25:01] options the the strike the strive and
[25:04] the stride those three three and he said
[25:08] that he made that with EI like those
[25:10] came out of EI conversation that's like
[25:12] I don't know like millions maybe even
[25:14] billions of dollars of wealth that were
[25:17] graded in uh an Michael Sailor AI
[25:21] conversation
[25:23] and the the implications of AI are so
[25:26] huge and if you I think it's it's a tool
[25:29] to play with. Uh you you haven't
[25:31] understood that.
 No. And and just like
[25:34] thinking about what like that unlock
[25:36] that he has and it makes you wonder like
[25:37] how much time of his did it save cuz
[25:40] like how much is his time worth cuz that
[25:42] like what what he was capable to put
[25:44] together like that's teams of lawyers
[25:46] and engineers and like financial experts
[25:49] like weeks of meetings and just reports
[25:53] typically go into creating products like
[25:55] that. and he's just like riffing them
[25:57] off like every other week and doing 90%
[26:00] of the work before the lawyers even have
[26:02] to get their hands on it. Like that's
[26:03] that's a huge unlock like because you
[26:05] can just iterate on these ideas so
[26:07] quick. And then there was another guy uh
[26:09] that was on Breedlove's podcast a few
[26:10] weeks or months ago and he was talking
[26:12] about how he uses AI to just like embody
[26:14] different personalities and like he he
[26:16] had it like there was like my Charlie
[26:18] Munger bot and there was the the the
[26:20] Warren Buffett bot and there was the
[26:22] Thomas Edison bot and you so could put
[26:24] make it uh get the perspectives from all
[26:28] of these different personalities in the
[26:30] real world that existed today, their
[26:33] current selves, their past selves,
[26:35] historical figures. He was even talking
[26:36] about how he had created different
[26:38] versions of himself. He had like a a
[26:40] present- day version of himself that he
[26:41] could he could communicate with, but
[26:43] then also a past version of himself. And
[26:45] then his projected vision of his future
[26:47] self. And he was able to start
[26:49] incorporating all these ideas and these
[26:51] personalities into his workflow. When he
[26:54] needed to to like ask about a product or
[26:56] an idea, he he would tap into like,
[26:59] okay, I have a a a stable of these
[27:01] experts with that that are familiar from
[27:03] this angle. and he can get them to
[27:04] analyze it and get their perspectives.
[27:06] It was like fascinating how much that he
[27:09] was putting into it and he talks as if
[27:11] he was just like driving in his car just
[27:13] talking to it just talking to these
[27:15] personalities cuz now like you can even
[27:16] give it their voice and it's uh yeah
[27:19] we're in we're in definitely brave new
[27:21] world crazy territory where I don't
[27:24] think any of the dystopian novels and
[27:26] movies that I've read saw any of this
[27:28] coming. like we're uh we're in uncharted
[27:31] territory and it it is very crazy and
[27:34] fun to explore and like watching shows
[27:35] like Black Mirror where it's like I I
[27:37] used to like the sci-fi that like I like
[27:39] the sci-fi that's like in the future
[27:42] like projecting things way out in the
[27:43] future but then when we start getting
[27:44] sci-fi that's like that crazy stuff
[27:47] could be happening now it's uh yeah
[27:49] we're living in in weird times where the
[27:51] the line between sci-fi and reality is
[27:53] very very blurry. We we all have now a
[27:56] Chavis uh to to help us like you you're
[28:00] Iron Man fan.
 Oh yeah. Yeah. I love Iron
[28:03] Man.
 And and Chavis is I think Javvis
[28:06] it's called the the the the robot
[28:08] helping him to produce the the Iron Man
[28:10] and all all those things. The personal
[28:12] assistant basically.
 Oh yeah. And just
[28:14] perfectly customized to everything we
[28:16] need. But then like Yeah. The
[28:17] double-edged sword is that it is creepy
[28:20] if if that is like some centralized
[28:22] entity that's harvesting all of our
[28:25] information and potentially can use it
[28:26] against us. Like we've seen how
[28:28] algorithms can be manipulated to to
[28:30] affect people's behavior. So, it's uh
[28:33] yeah, we're going to have to develop
[28:35] strategies to perceive and protect
[28:38] ourselves from like that algorithmic
[28:41] manipulation and the different ways that
[28:44] that AI can manipulate our behavior cuz
[28:47] yeah, the the books are out there on how
[28:49] we can impact social behavior in various
[28:52] ways and we've seen it happen in various
[28:55] uh historical events, the recent and way
[28:58] back. So it's um
[29:01] yeah it's it's a different world that we
[29:03] are going to have to navigate and yeah I
[29:07] think cryptography and bitcoin are
[29:08] definitely going to be centerpieces of
[29:10] us being a having to interact with these
[29:14] digital and artificial uh realities that
[29:16] we're now going to be living in. How
[29:19] important is something? How important is
[29:22] Bitcoin in an AI world where you cannot
[29:26] know for sure what is real and what is
[29:28] not real and the only thing that you
[29:30] really can trust and verify is is
[29:33] Bitcoin. Well, that I might need to lean
[29:35] on into the uh the software thesis a
[29:38] little bit and like this the idea of
[29:39] like the being able to protect your your
[29:42] your digital life with like almost a
[29:45] cyber dome that will you'll have you use
[29:48] like a Bitcoin checkpoint with you
[29:50] cannot access the information without a
[29:53] cost. the yeah kind of like the ideas
[29:56] that that Lowry puts forward that it's
[29:57] it's going we're going to have to have
[30:00] some sort of like digital gated
[30:03] communities and servers that we can can
[30:06] personally control like
[30:09] it's yeah I I I don't really have it
[30:11] fully fleshed out but like it it I do
[30:14] see some like merit to what Lowry is
[30:17] talking about with like the the cyber
[30:19] dome ideas and and having a an immutable
[30:22] commodity like digital commodity that uh
[30:25] that forces a cost function to activate
[30:28] a system or access a system is going to
[30:31] be an essential especially in a world
[30:33] where there's going to be both like
[30:35] human and digital potentially
[30:37] adversarial actors in these spaces
[30:39] whether whether they're acting on our
[30:41] behalf to
[30:43] to do something elsewhere or if it's an
[30:46] adversary trying to penetrate our
[30:48] systems. Yeah, I I think that that
[30:50] there's going to be something along
[30:51] those lines that uh that that is going
[30:55] to be enacted, but it's it's hard to see
[30:57] that far into the future when we are
[31:00] dealing with uh with with right now like
[31:03] everything's very exciting in the space
[31:04] and we're seeing all these updates about
[31:07] like nations getting into it, but
[31:09] there's going to be yeah real threats
[31:12] that we're going to have to adapt to.
[31:14] But it but you don't know what what hap
[31:16] what you're going to have to deal with
[31:17] until it happens. So that's why like the
[31:21] anti-fragility argument is is essential
[31:24] and why it keeps proving time and time
[31:27] again that
[31:29] that's it's adaptable and it's going to
[31:32] adapt whatever comes up and we're going
[31:34] to figure it out and we will we will get
[31:37] past whatever challenges it faces. Like
[31:39] that's that's the whole idea of the
[31:40] system is that we we have rallied around
[31:43] it because we are confident that it will
[31:45] adapt and we will adapt with it because
[31:47] we are part of its story
 is is Bitcoin
[31:50] or like maybe differently ask um what do
[31:52] you think is currently with all the
[31:55] things going on inside of Bitcoin? What
[31:57] is currently for you the most
[31:58] interesting thing that is going on?
[32:02] Well, I'm liking watching the
[32:03] developments in the mining like the the
[32:05] heat punk guys are very interesting. the
[32:08] the Bitax and what's going on with them
[32:10] like trying to open source a lot of the
[32:12] uh the mining stack and building like
[32:15] the all of the parts right from the the
[32:17] hashboards to the control boards and
[32:20] more like custom uh chipsets so that
[32:23] basically anybody can participate in
[32:25] building AS6 and and configuring them to
[32:28] their own needs. So that's going to open
[32:29] up a lot of interesting avenues
[32:32] especially like now we're seeing
[32:33] companies that are literally building
[32:34] them as space heaters. So, we're going
[32:37] to see a lot more interest on that
[32:38] front. I find it interesting seeing the
[32:41] the I didn't really get too much into
[32:43] the the opera turn drama. It was I
[32:46] watched it from my perspective and it
[32:48] seems to have passed on and everyone's
[32:52] just decided it's like too much heat,
[32:53] we're moving on. It's just another way
[32:55] like the the system kind of like it's
[32:58] it's almost like the immune system that
[32:59] just reacted when things got too heated
[33:03] up and there was too much disagreement.
[33:05] And it's interesting to see how that
[33:07] stuff plays out. Um it's another
[33:09] interesting one. The like the samurai
[33:11] samurai guys and like the lawfare that's
[33:14] being engaged in that. I don't know if
[33:15] you've spoken to anybody that's involved
[33:16] in that. like the fact that the the um
[33:20] the prosecutors had spoken with the
[33:23] regulator and said that they're not
[33:24] breaking any laws and they're still
[33:26] going forward with it, which is very
[33:29] interesting to to see why when there's
[33:31] basically every other instance is is
[33:33] starting to be dropped against uh
[33:36] anybody that's developing like crypto
[33:38] technologies. And that was the worrying
[33:40] thing is the implications that it could
[33:43] potentially
[33:44] um if they succeed in calling what
[33:47] Samurai was doing like money
[33:48] transmitters then they want to broaden
[33:50] that into like node runners and miners
[33:52] are potentially subject to the same
[33:54] rules as money transmission institutions
[33:57] as well. So that'll def it it'll be it's
[33:59] an interesting attack vector that um can
[34:03] happen against the the network and it
[34:04] would basically apply a lot of the the
[34:07] the regulations that Elizabeth Warren
[34:10] seems to want to apply on the industry
[34:11] where it would be yeah everybody is
[34:14] treated as if they're a money business
[34:16] and that is kind of goes against the the
[34:19] technology itself like we're we're just
[34:22] transmitting messages back and forth and
[34:25] updating a ledger like
[34:27] it it gets complicated to treat it like
[34:30] a centralized authority like a bank or
[34:32] like the Swift network because it's
[34:34] Bitcoin and everybody's participating.
[34:36] You can't narrow down every one minor.
[34:38] You can't narrow down any one node
[34:40] runner cuz we're it exists everywhere
[34:42] globally all at once. And it's it's a
[34:45] it's fascinating to see all how
[34:48] resistive it is and how much like
[34:50] support that these that that this is
[34:52] getting from the community to defend
[34:54] against these uh in intrusion like
[34:57] unfair intrusions into how it actually
[35:00] works. And it's important like it's
[35:03] super important that we always defend
[35:06] ourselves and we kind of make clear that
[35:11] Bitcoin is there to separate money and
[35:15] state and not to uh be included in the
[35:18] state. It will be included in the state
[35:19] obviously as an asset but it it's it's
[35:21] there mostly for giving sovereignty
[35:24] rights and and it cannot be co-opted in
[35:27] in any way shape or form. And obviously
[35:31] the the current system will fight back
[35:33] or like will will have a reaction to
[35:36] that long like both of them are trying
[35:39] to subsume each other right now. Like
[35:40] the Bitcoiners are like we're rolling in
[35:42] the Trojan horse and then the the like
[35:44] the Wall Street and the government are
[35:46] like oh we're going to we're going to
[35:48] co-opt it. Like they co-opt every
[35:50] movement that that doesn't align with
[35:52] them that's not going to go away. They
[35:53] find a way to to kind of sterilize it
[35:56] and make it their own. But I don't I
[35:59] don't know who's going to win this one.
[36:00] But it's it's two un two immovable
[36:04] forces really pushing against each
[36:06] other. But I think Bitcoin is more
[36:08] immovable than the state infrastructure
[36:10] and it's it's global.
 It's everywhere
[36:14] and like Yeah. And if you don't part
[36:15] like the wrong move is to not
[36:16] participate because if everyone else
[36:18] participates like you have no say. Like
[36:19] if you want to be writing blocks you
[36:23] have to be mining. You have to have some
[36:25] sort of infrastructure that's supporting
[36:27] your transactions getting in the blocks
[36:29] because you can't be certain that you
[36:31] that that you will uh be able to get
[36:33] that block space unless you have your
[36:35] own infrastructure to do it yourself cuz
[36:38] everyone else is going to be
[36:39] self-interested and wanting to process
[36:41] their own blocks. And so obviously
[36:43] there's going to be the self-interested
[36:45] uh like economic miners that will take
[36:47] the highest transaction fees. But yeah,
[36:49] when we do start seeing nation states
[36:50] prioritizing blocks from their own
[36:52] citizens or their allies, then it it is
[36:55] going to create an interesting dynamic
[36:57] where yeah, if you're not if you're not
[36:59] playing the game, you're reliant on
[37:00] others to to do it for you. Uh another
[37:03] thing I wanted to just ask like on the
[37:05] well not ask but uh point out did you
[37:07] get to see the skull of Satoshi because
[37:09] that was an interesting uh Yeah. When
[37:12] you were at were you cuz were you in Las
[37:13] Vegas? Did you didn't see the giant
[37:15] green skull that they had on display? Oh
[37:17] yeah, that that
 cuz that's a funny one
[37:20] cuz like that was like Greenpeace had
[37:22] their big campaign to change the code
[37:24] and essentially uh when when I first saw
[37:28] that uh my first instinct is we have to
[37:30] have that at a conference and sure
[37:32] enough three three like not even 3 years
[37:35] later it shows up at the conference as a
[37:37] trophy basically saying that like yeah
[37:39] like this was a uh poorly thoughtout
[37:43] attempt to diminish Bitcoin and uh it
[37:47] didn't work and we won and the trophy is
[37:49] ours and it's now on display at our
[37:52] biggest event of the year. So, it's it
[37:54] it kind of goes to show like the Yeah,
[37:57] there there's the skull there. It's uh
[38:00] it's quite the piece of art. I've got a
[38:01] few like little 3D printed versions of
[38:03] it myself. But, uh
 I I I love that. I
[38:07] literally made uh 22 hours this this
[38:10] exact tweet. I love this reminder.
[38:12] Everything is good for Bitcoin. Even a
[38:14] paid campaign from a shitcoin company
[38:16] turns out to be something good and
[38:19] valuable for the Bitcoin community.
[38:21] Yeah. And it shows when you go up
[38:22] against the Bitcoin community like
[38:24] especially if you're um not
[38:28] uh Yeah. If you're
[38:31] Yeah. If you're if you're coming at it
[38:33] and you're not with in bad faith,
[38:36] especially with relying on like bad
[38:38] information, then you're um it's not
[38:41] going to end well for you cuz yeah, the
[38:43] Bitcoiners, they're very aggressive at
[38:45] learning everything they can about every
[38:48] system that Bitcoin seems to touch. Like
[38:50] and it was just fascinating to see like
[38:52] as I was getting into Bitcoin mining
[38:54] just the amount of experts in energy
[38:57] systems in power markets that are being
[38:59] attracted to what Bitcoin mining unlocks
[39:02] and the problems that it solves on all
[39:04] of these the inefficiencies that exist
[39:06] in our grid and power systems that it
[39:08] was it it's inevitable that we're going
[39:12] it's just going to metastasize into our
[39:16] power system to such a degree that we we
[39:18] we won't be able to unstick it. Like
[39:20] even if there is like a flip in the US
[39:23] and they do get a hostile government or
[39:25] there's even other hostile governments
[39:28] like I know the the EU isn't uh the most
[39:30] favorable towards Bitcoin Bitcoin mining
[39:32] except for like a few select nations but
[39:34] uh it's just goes to show that uh it's
[39:38] everywhere and it's not going away. The
[39:41] first time I ever made any money, I got
[39:43] myself from that money a watch. And ever
[39:46] since then, I collect time pieces to
[39:48] remember times where I achieved some
[39:51] milestone. That's why I got the Bitcoin
[39:54] 2025 edition when I went to my first
[39:57] ever American Bitcoin conference. So for
[39:59] me, the Bitcoin watches from Coin Villan
[40:02] represents the time that we are living
[40:04] in. For every person that wears a
[40:07] Bitcoin watch, I know they are
[40:09] representing sound money to the outside
[40:12] world. Make sure to check out those
[40:14] amazing coin vigilante time pieces down
[40:18] in the descriptions. I love those
[40:20] watches so so much. The most important
[40:23] thing for your Bitcoin journey is not
[40:25] buying Bitcoin, but it's how to keep
[40:28] them. And yes, you have maybe the right
[40:30] tools, but how do you actually go ahead
[40:32] and stick it all together? So it's the
[40:35] most secure for you personally.
[40:37] Self-custody is a deeply personalized
[40:39] journey and the Bitcoin way is helping
[40:42] you exactly finding that correct setup
[40:45] for you personally. They're also helping
[40:48] you with securing your own cyber
[40:50] security. And if you want to go one step
[40:53] above all that, you can even get a
[40:56] consultation for a plan B residency. Go
[41:00] to the bitcoinway.com/roin
[41:04] and you will get a 30inut free
[41:06] consultation. I know how big of a hurdle
[41:09] it can be to have self-custody, but it's
[41:12] so freaking important to make that first
[41:15] step. We have to make sure it's as easy
[41:18] and simple as possible. And that's
[41:21] exactly what Bitbox did. Bitbox created
[41:24] the simplest and the easiest hardware
[41:26] wallet to use to get into self custody.
[41:30] So get yourself a Bitbox down from the
[41:33] link in the description. And when you
[41:34] use code Robin, you even get a 5%
[41:37] discount. And one point that I want to
[41:39] just add here is an open system that's
[41:43] compelling enough to bring people in
[41:46] consistently, which Bitcoin is, will
[41:49] always win out against any closed
[41:52] system, even if the closed system is
[41:54] compelling. And then we have closed
[41:56] systems that are not compelling. Like
[41:58] who would like to embrace the euro? If
[42:02] you just break it down to first
[42:04] principles thinking, it's like, yeah,
[42:05] it's a really bad currency or the dollar
[42:08] or like any other fiat currencies for
[42:09] that matter. So, open system is
[42:12] compelling will always win out against
[42:14] closed systems that are not compelling.
[42:16] So, the fight is pretty clear on what
[42:18] what end I will I want to where I want
[42:21] to put my money towards.
 Yeah. And you
[42:24] didn't choose to adopt the euro. You
[42:25] were you were basically born into it.
[42:28] Yeah. you you would be right around the
[42:30] right age where it was uh released into
[42:33] into the system like it's what 23 24
[42:36] years old or something when the euro was
[42:38] released. So so like even in the context
[42:40] of like of like Bitcoin only being 16
[42:43] years old like one of the other major
[42:45] currencies in the world was only like
[42:48] barely not even three decades old
[42:49] itself. But it did have like a path
[42:52] dependency that that was it was able to
[42:55] kind of piggyback on the existing
[42:56] financial systems that you had in Europe
[42:58] and it was just started to displace the
[43:00] local currencies and then at one point
[43:03] it just became the de facto currency of
[43:05] Europe and it almost in a sly roundabout
[43:08] way. But now we have Bitcoin which is a
[43:10] a currency a money that we can choose to
[43:14] opt into and it's available like
[43:16] anywhere to us at any time and it is
[43:18] borderless and it and it is beneficial
[43:20] especially to the people outside of of
[43:23] Europe and the western nations like I uh
[43:25] working through um Alex Gladstein's book
[43:28] the uh IMF in the the hidden repression
[43:31] book and it uh it details a lot of
[43:36] environments where Bitcoin can be
[43:38] beneficial to people that don't have uh
[43:41] they don't have the same capabilities
[43:44] and access to the markets and basically
[43:46] anything that we do. Like hearing the
[43:48] stories of what Grid List does is is
[43:50] remarkable. Like some of these places,
[43:51] they're just getting their first light
[43:52] bulbs and their first refrigerators. So
[43:55] to know that that Bitcoin is unlocking
[43:57] that for people and then like the second
[43:59] order effects there's now these kids are
[44:01] able to ed educate themselves and now we
[44:04] can unlock more talent and more minds to
[44:08] produce god knows what new technologies
[44:11] for our for humanity. So we need but the
[44:16] key is to generate bring them the bare
[44:19] minimum of like energy that they need
[44:23] like to meet those needs. And there's
[44:25] still billions of people that don't even
[44:27] like reach that minimum level that are
[44:29] still subsisting on like the bare
[44:31] minimum still like burning wood for for
[44:33] fuel burning like dung and for and it's
[44:37] it is unhealthy for them. like in many
[44:40] cases like their options when they do
[44:42] get access to like natural gas like that
[44:44] is such an upgrade from what they have
[44:46] been using and that it is much better
[44:49] for the environment but there's there
[44:51] still is a long way to go to transition
[44:53] completely out of hydrocarbons and like
[44:55] I I don't like to disparage hydrocarbons
[44:58] in and as much as like they've brought
[44:59] our society to where it is today and we
[45:02] owe a huge debt of gratitude to all of
[45:05] the like the pioneers and the technology
[45:07] that has uh been used to get us here and
[45:10] has been dependent on hydrocarbons. But
[45:12] we're never going to stop using them
[45:13] because even the technology that we want
[45:15] to use to displace hydrocarbons like the
[45:17] windmills and solar panels and even the
[45:19] nuclear reactors like there is always
[45:22] going to be an element of hydrocarbons
[45:24] used to develop them. So, it's like you
[45:26] can't just remove the one of the
[45:29] ingredients and and assume that
[45:31] everything's still going to be like that
[45:34] the recipe is going to turn out the same
[45:36] because it's an essential component like
[45:38] coal and gas and like these fuels that
[45:42] we have to support our society and all
[45:45] of the things that we can build. It's uh
[45:48] yeah, all of it comes down to our
[45:50] ability to harness and deploy energy.
[45:52] And then like Bitcoin mining is it seems
[45:55] like it's the pinnacle of us refining
[45:57] that energy into a crystallized form
[45:59] that can store it for an un like an
[46:03] unforeseen amount of time like it and it
[46:06] is harnessing the forces of nature like
[46:09] I I was thinking about it uh recently
[46:11] and it's a like generating electricity
[46:15] we're harnessing the forces of nature
[46:16] whether it's like collecting solar
[46:18] photons or we're rotating machines by
[46:22] collecting steam and then just creating
[46:24] a magnetic field with uh copper coils
[46:27] cuz that's that's all generating
[46:28] electricity is just spin a turbine
[46:30] creates a magnetic field and then it
[46:32] creates an electron flow and then we
[46:34] further refine that into computational
[46:36] hashes and then that is refined into
[46:38] bitcoin. So like Bitcoin itself is
[46:42] directly like only four steps away from
[46:45] our ability to harness the forces of
[46:47] nature at every level. And it's uh it is
[46:52] it is fascinating to start thinking
[46:54] about it at that those like that depth
[46:57] of of how it is almost like a natural
[47:01] force that was just waiting to be
[47:03] discovered. And like it it's an
[47:06] invention. But then it also it
[47:09] discovered new like almost a new realm
[47:12] of reality that we can now explore and
[47:15] we're pioneers in that space. It's so
[47:18] interesting when we see all of these
[47:20] developments that we have talked about
[47:21] and we see Bitcoin mining making it
[47:23] easier to also build out new energy and
[47:25] power plants and then we see also how
[47:29] electricity with renewable energy with
[47:31] nuclear energy with all those things are
[47:34] kind of getting getting maybe or
[47:36] probably cheaper over time. Do you think
[47:38] there's a time I think even Trump talked
[47:41] about it we will have so much energy in
[47:44] the USA that that that they will say
[47:47] like stop producing energy like I don't
[47:49] like exactly what he said but something
[47:50] like that Gary Gdon I think said that we
[47:54] will have free electricity because we
[47:55] have too much electricity at some point.
[47:58] Um do do you do you see that coming
[48:00] where we have too much electricity?
[48:04] That is a very well I don't wouldn't say
[48:07] we will have too much electricity. I I'm
[48:10] more aligned with uh we will have so
[48:12] much electricity that
[48:15] we're going to h like it we're going to
[48:17] have to put it somewhere and Bitcoin
[48:19] mining is going to be just that marginal
[48:21] buyer of all of that excess electricity.
[48:24] Um, I tossed around the tossed out this
[48:26] idea on a recent podcast I did. I think
[48:28] it was on with Joel Bernett and um that
[48:31] like right now Bitcoin uses what like a
[48:34] fraction of a percent of the global
[48:35] energy. I think it's something like 5.6%
[48:38] is roughly. I foresee a time in the
[48:41] future where Bitcoin is consuming more
[48:46] power on like a nominal basis than all
[48:48] of humanity does today. But at that
[48:51] time, we're going to be generating so
[48:53] much power that it will still be about
[48:56] 0.5 to 1% of all of the power generated
[49:00] by like humanity on Earth, probably in
[49:04] our solar system. God knows by that
[49:06] point we we might be starting to branch
[49:08] out even further. But like it it it's an
[49:10] interesting thought experiment just like
[49:12] that that Bitcoin will be a catalyst for
[49:14] us to build immense amounts of power
[49:18] infrastructure,
[49:19] but because it'll play like the pioneer
[49:21] species, the pioneer load role, it will
[49:24] continually push the uses of that power
[49:27] up to higher and higher uses while just
[49:30] continually filling that margin. And we
[49:33] will never have a limit to how much
[49:34] power we can generate. And yeah, it'll
[49:36] probably cost almost nothing. And it
[49:38] also depends on uh what we're measuring
[49:40] it from like are we are we going to
[49:42] start when when is the time going to
[49:44] come when we start measuring energy in
[49:47] like sats per kilowatt hour that's going
[49:49] to be an interesting transition that is
[49:51] especially as we start thinking about a
[49:54] more deflationary mindset like I got
[49:56] into an argument on X the other day like
[49:59] someone was saying that if we allow for
[50:01] deflation to happen it would be
[50:03] devastating and it would destroy the
[50:04] entire society and we'd be in Mad Max in
[50:07] no time and Like I just I can't accept
[50:10] that as as a a reality. I in as much as
[50:15] Bitcoin exists to to like taper that
[50:19] that um those productivity gains and
[50:22] just collect it into the money becoming
[50:24] more valuable. And yes, we will save
[50:26] more and we will not stop consuming
[50:29] things. We'll just be more discerning
[50:30] about our our consumption. Um, but if we
[50:34] have another massive debt bubble pop,
[50:38] that's a massive deflationary event,
[50:40] that's a completely different story. But
[50:41] it it almost seems like the argument was
[50:43] like that the deflationary event that
[50:46] happened in the 1930s, that was a bad
[50:49] deflationary event. So deflation is de
[50:51] facto bad. But then the way that Jeff
[50:53] Booth argues about how deflation is just
[50:55] merely productivity gains being acred to
[50:57] the value of our money, like that is a
[51:00] totally different way of of how it's
[51:02] going to play out. And I think Bitcoin
[51:04] is just going to allow us to slowly
[51:06] transition from this like
[51:08] hyperinflationary environment with fiat
[51:10] currencies that we we are uh working
[51:13] through now. And it's going to push us
[51:15] through to the next phase. But it's
[51:17] just, you know, we're living through
[51:18] that transitionary phase where we're
[51:19] going from an inflationary system to a
[51:21] deflationary system. And because our
[51:23] only experiences historically with
[51:25] deflationary events have been like
[51:27] tragic, like just traumatic from like
[51:30] the Great Depression, then it it has
[51:34] almost like a a cultural bias to it that
[51:36] that is just what people understand
[51:38] deflation bad. And so when you do start
[51:41] thinking about it in a way the way that
[51:43] we do it it almost doesn't compute with
[51:46] them. But I the the other thing just
[51:49] about the costs going down like I was um
[51:51] the uh yeah are you familiar with the
[51:54] meme of the cost of the house showing it
[51:56] in fiat slowly going up and then the
[51:58] cost of bitcoin slowly going down. I I
[52:00] applied that to a nuclear reactor and it
[52:03] basically works out the same because
[52:05] it's the exact same idea. like I had
[52:07] taken um it was in 2021 one of the the
[52:12] projects I think it was in the UK they
[52:13] were saying it was going to take a
[52:14] billion euros to build the this reactor
[52:18] and then they four years later just
[52:20] earlier this year they reevaluated and
[52:22] it was like oh no it's going to cost 1.7
[52:25] billion so in fiat terms it went up by
[52:27] 70%. And then I was like, okay, I'm
[52:29] going to take those two time points and
[52:30] I'm going to put in what was cost what
[52:33] would what did it cost at Bitcoin in
[52:34] that at that point. And if you measured
[52:36] it in terms of Bitcoin, cost went down
[52:38] by 30%. So like that totally changes
[52:42] like the the dynamic of how we look at
[52:46] like the the financial and economic
[52:47] structure of these things because now we
[52:50] can start thinking of if these companies
[52:51] are applying Bitcoin as their hurdle
[52:53] rate as well. they're going to be a lot
[52:55] discerning more discerning about how
[52:57] they allocate their capital. Like if it
[52:59] doesn't apply to the core mission and
[53:01] it's just idle cash and it's not going
[53:04] to do better than
[53:06] accumulating like Bitcoin does, it might
[53:08] as well just be held as Bitcoin in a
[53:11] reserve until it's needed for later.
[53:13] We're seeing a lot of like mostly
[53:14] distressed companies and zombie
[53:16] companies are the ones that are kind of
[53:17] attracted to the Bitcoin treasury
[53:18] strategy, but it's also going to be
[53:20] attractive to actual productive
[53:22] companies that have like real products
[53:24] and like a real offering that are also
[53:26] cash flow positive is it's going to be
[53:29] for everyone. It's going to work for
[53:31] everyone and some of some will work out
[53:33] better than others and there's going to
[53:34] be an infinite different configurations
[53:37] on how it can be like assembled with the
[53:39] different like needs of companies like
[53:41] and also like where their jurisdictions
[53:42] are and what their their products are.
[53:45] And I'm yeah I'm hoping that some of
[53:48] them can start seeing these ideas and it
[53:51] get out there more into the uh the space
[53:54] that I'm interested in seeing like
[53:55] nuclear power uh start adopting Bitcoin
[53:58] more be cuz yeah it was exciting when we
[54:01] saw the the Talon Energy and Terolf
[54:03] project but there hasn't really been
[54:05] much since then. So I want more I want
[54:08] more nuclear Bitcoin and I'm trying to
[54:10] prompt it however I can.
[54:14] What do you think is the mix between
[54:16] like like when you look like 10 20 30
[54:19] years out the energy mix between nuclear
[54:22] and all the other uh energy sources?
 Um
[54:26] I think that nuclear is going to make a
[54:29] comeback and we're going to start seeing
[54:31] a resurgence early in the 30s because
[54:33] there's going to be a time lag. like
[54:35] they're talking about building these
[54:36] reactors now, but we're not going to see
[54:38] them active until like give give it at
[54:41] least a decade, even if they started
[54:42] building today. Um, we see a lot of wind
[54:46] and solar like their charts are almost
[54:49] going vertical, but I do have the
[54:51] concern that it might end up looking
[54:53] like a shitcoin chart where it's just
[54:55] pumps up. And then if they're not
[54:57] supported by massive amounts of
[54:59] subsidies and credits, can they actually
[55:02] stand on their own? are they profitable
[55:03] without those supports? Like we we need
[55:06] to see that because that seems to be the
[55:09] um the catalyst that has been driving a
[55:12] lot of their deployment and then they're
[55:13] gets getting to the point where it's
[55:15] using like lower quality land. It
[55:17] requiring more transmission
[55:18] infrastructure. It's requiring more
[55:20] inverters and and extra infrastructure
[55:22] required to to reliably integrate it
[55:25] with the grid as um what was seen in um
[55:29] Spain just a few weeks ago. that power
[55:32] outage that they had a total blackout.
[55:33] And it was because the frequency of
[55:35] their grid went haywire because they
[55:38] were just getting too much wind and sun
[55:41] at the same time. And then it the
[55:43] between cloud cover and just variations
[55:47] like there the frequency went out of
[55:49] whack. And typically most grids they you
[55:54] spinning reserves are what supports the
[55:56] inertia in those grids. And Spain had
[55:59] reduced that to almost 20% of their
[56:01] capacity. Whereas like in America their
[56:04] their spinning reserves are almost like
[56:06] 60% of the entire grid. And it's
[56:08] essentially just the the turbines all
[56:10] spin at the exact same frequency. And if
[56:13] the frequency starts to um diverge from
[56:16] the like the 60 Hz that the target is,
[56:20] they they the spinning machines will
[56:23] compensate for it and give almost a
[56:25] buffer before any negative impacts can
[56:28] happen on the grid. It gives uh
[56:30] operators time to either like isolate
[56:32] themselves from any potentially
[56:34] cascading events like what happened like
[56:36] in Ontario, our entire grid went out
[56:38] from a tree fell on the line in Ohio and
[56:40] then it cascaded to Niagara Falls and
[56:42] then almost all of New York in Ontario
[56:44] went out and this was like 20 23 years
[56:47] ago or something. It was a a major
[56:49] event. But it just goes to show that
[56:50] like these systems are fragile and if
[56:53] they do not have buffers and inertia to
[56:55] uh to support them that they are at risk
[56:58] of these events. And essentially it's
[57:00] just like we have to be realistic about
[57:03] how the grids are structured because
[57:05] putting too much intermittent and
[57:09] non-dispatchable power on the grids, it
[57:11] has its risks and it and it starts
[57:13] compromising reliability. like I'm all
[57:15] for green and clean grids but not at the
[57:19] not at the risk of compromising
[57:20] reliability. So then uh yeah so as back
[57:23] to like the question I events like that
[57:25] are going to cause a lot of
[57:27] reconsideration about the idea of like
[57:30] 100% wind and solar grid. So the so it's
[57:32] going to bring the conversation back to
[57:35] like what is the ideal mix and that's
[57:38] probably going to settle on a
[57:40] substantial base load that if it they
[57:42] want clean that's got to come from
[57:44] nuclear. So that'll probably be like 40
[57:46] 50% of the mix and then everything else
[57:48] on top of that will be supplementary
[57:50] with like the intermittent sources.
[57:52] There'll probably be a lot of batteries.
[57:53] There's places that do um uh stored
[57:56] hydro where the excess power just gets
[57:58] pumped back up into the reservoir of a
[58:00] dam. That's a a typical way that power
[58:02] gets stored. And we'll just see a lot
[58:04] more systems that that integrate all of
[58:06] these different m mixtures. And it'll a
[58:09] lot of it'll also probably be like um
[58:12] monitored and managed by AI in real time
[58:14] because like from what I heard what
[58:16] happened with the uh the Iberian
[58:18] blackout was that they had seconds to
[58:21] make a decision to to cut off uh and
[58:23] isolate parts of the grid and before
[58:26] they even had a chance to make to take
[58:28] an action like it had already happened.
[58:30] it happens so fast. So it almost
[58:33] makes the the impetus to have some sort
[58:35] of like algorithmic management of these
[58:37] systems. Like you want still want to
[58:38] have a human in the loop, but like if
[58:40] there was like a subsecond AI monitoring
[58:44] these systems, they it possibly could
[58:46] have reacted and and pulled some fail
[58:48] safes before any uh any further damage
[58:51] could have happened to the grid. There's
[58:53] a lot of potential upgrades and
[58:55] technologies that we can add to this,
[58:56] but it's also has to be done right
[58:58] because it does open up a lot of
[59:01] potential unknowns with new technologies
[59:03] that we're not familiar with,
[59:04] incorporating them in our our essential
[59:07] uh infrastructure, which is our our
[59:09] energy and our energy delivery systems.
[59:11] But it yeah, I hate to see countries
[59:14] going like backwards in their energy uh
[59:17] infrastructure and not being able to
[59:19] provide power reliably when it's needed
[59:21] anywhere that it's needed. And that is
[59:23] essentially what we have been granted in
[59:26] these western nations that we are very
[59:28] privileged to have a working system. It
[59:30] is it is remarkable how how uh fragile
[59:35] it is when we see events like what
[59:36] happened in Spain last week or last
[59:39] month.
[59:40] I I trust AI even
[59:44] almost even more than humans especially
[59:46] when it comes to like fast decisions. I
[59:49] for like as an Austrian as a European
[59:51] you you're not in privilege to have
[59:53] self-driving cars but I was in Miami for
[59:56] 3 4 days and there I was driving a Tesla
[60:00] with full self of driving activated and
[60:03] it just drove me around for 1 hour
[60:05] completely on its own through the city
[60:07] through the highways through everything.
[60:09] Yeah, we're living in the future, man.
[60:11] We we we are freaking living in the
[60:13] future. And the thing is, um when I was
[60:16] driving, I didn't feel as safe when the
[60:19] AI was driving because I never drove in
[60:21] America. I don't drive a lot of cars. Uh
[60:24] anyways, like I'm I'm not a frequent
[60:27] driver. And then it it really drives in
[60:32] a very safe but still fast way where I'm
[60:35] like, okay, like it it really knows what
[60:37] it's doing. And it just took me an hour
[60:40] and it I was trusting it more than
[60:43] myself.
[60:45] Yeah. Cuz it's making thousands of
[60:47] decisions a second. And like we don't
[60:50] Yeah. We're not capable of that. Like we
[60:52] we have our sight in our peripherals and
[60:54] then there's even like blind spots and
[60:56] like Yeah, there was an accident on the
[60:59] highway not far from where I live just
[61:00] this week and it so like and just seeing
[61:04] the stats on the self-driving cars that
[61:06] Yeah. it it it it's improving at an
[61:10] astonishing rate and I don't know if
[61:12] we'll see it uh how long it'll be before
[61:14] we start seeing it where I am up in
[61:16] Canada cuz we do have icy conditions and
[61:18] in winter conditions I don't it's going
[61:20] to take them a minute to to adapt to
[61:22] that but definitely in places where
[61:24] weather is consistent all year round and
[61:26] worst you have to deal with is some rain
[61:28] then uh yeah that it's going to be
[61:32] quicker than we could have imagined.
[61:34] Um
[61:36] One thing that I'm curious with with
[61:38] electricity because you mentioned the
[61:40] outages,
[61:42] how could like if you if you can just
[61:45] design an electric grid from from from
[61:49] basically the the from from scratch
[61:52] again, how can we make sure that it's
[61:54] the most robust, stable, resistant
[61:56] against outages like the the most
[61:58] decentralized electric grid? I like the
[62:01] idea of of like a constellation of micro
[62:05] grids. Like it kind of already is that
[62:08] in a way. And it just be the way that
[62:10] like the North American grid got built
[62:12] out. It was all just it just patched
[62:14] together and just extend transmission
[62:16] lines here, add a new substation here,
[62:18] add new power plant here, and it all
[62:20] just kind of got patched together. And
[62:22] we understand how these systems work
[62:25] together well. But the way things are
[62:27] going, especially with um with the the
[62:31] potential of SMRs and the way that a lot
[62:34] of markets that we want to serve power
[62:37] to are fairly isolated from the grid,
[62:41] especially we start thinking about like
[62:42] South America and Africa, like it's
[62:45] going to be cheaper to build the like a
[62:48] a power generation infrastructure right
[62:50] in a community rather than extend
[62:52] transmission lines from a central
[62:54] facility out to them. Um, so I foresee
[62:58] it kind of like um how the African
[63:01] nations kind of skipped over the the
[63:04] physical phone lines and they basically
[63:06] everybody in Africa has a cell phone and
[63:09] they never dealt with having like a
[63:11] wired phone like that was very rare.
[63:13] They their technology skipped right over
[63:15] like that telecom's era right into the
[63:18] yeah the cellular uh era. Uh I foresee
[63:21] something kind of similar to that where
[63:24] these these micro grids that are
[63:26] anchored by like SMRs and probably like
[63:28] geothermal facilities like micro hydro
[63:31] plants in various ways that are anchored
[63:33] by Bitcoin mining like those micro grids
[63:36] will be these anchors and then as the
[63:38] opportunities to extend transmission and
[63:40] infrastructure to nearby communities and
[63:43] then start kind of like linking them
[63:45] together so that they have they have
[63:47] ways that they're connected but also
[63:50] able to operate isolated in as uh as
[63:54] self uh self-sustaining islands for
[63:56] themselves that they can support
[63:57] themselves should there be an issue
[64:00] outside of them in the wider grid where
[64:02] they want to they they don't want to be
[64:04] exposed to a grid outage that happened
[64:07] somewhere like hundreds of kilometers
[64:08] away that can cascade towards their
[64:10] system. they can just cut off the um
[64:14] with basically just like circuit
[64:15] breakers and isolate themselves and with
[64:18] with their own power infrastructure. So
[64:20] I foresee a lot of a lot a lot of
[64:23] infrastructure like that developing but
[64:24] it's going
[64:27] going to happen once we start seeing
[64:29] SMRs more prove their capabilities and
[64:32] start actually getting deployed and
[64:34] finding finding their fit in the market.
[64:36] But like right now the big challenge is
[64:39] financing these things and getting them
[64:41] over that uh demonstrating their first
[64:43] of a kind uh operating units and working
[64:46] out any troubleshooting kinks before
[64:48] they start getting into mass production.
[64:50] So there's multiple phases to getting
[64:53] them out into like the commercial uh
[64:55] markets and deploying them
[64:57] internationally. So like we're we're
[64:59] still easily like a decade away before
[65:02] we start seeing that point. But we are
[65:03] there's a lot of excitement in like
[65:06] various um nuclear companies in the
[65:09] states uh publicly traded ones like
[65:11] Oaklo and Nanuclear that are progressing
[65:14] through the licensing phase. They've
[65:15] they're showing progress on their their
[65:17] first of a kind units. They're they're
[65:19] going to probably have operational
[65:22] prototypes within the next 3 or 4 years
[65:25] and then it's probably going to be a
[65:27] gradually then suddenly vibe to it where
[65:29] once all this technology finally like
[65:30] reach a maturity point. It's going to
[65:32] proliferate so quickly that we we aren't
[65:34] even going to like people that aren't
[65:36] paying attention aren't even going to
[65:37] know where it came from. But it's going
[65:39] to happen fast. But a lot of the
[65:41] development is going to happen behind
[65:42] the scenes and kind of in stealth under
[65:44] the radar.
 It's so fascinating. It's
[65:47] like in 10 years, in 15 years, it will
[65:50] be even more exciting than right now.
[65:52] There's so much happening in in in all
[65:55] of the things with AI, Bitcoin, and and
[65:57] energy. Uh 2035 will be even better than
[66:00] 2025. I feel like
 it's exciting to be a
[66:04] pioneer in a new frontier like even just
[66:06] observing those that are like really
[66:08] immersed in the space. Like like you do
[66:11] the podcast and you talk to a lot of
[66:12] people, so you get a lot of insight into
[66:14] what's going on. And I I listen to a lot
[66:16] of podcasts. So I'm based I've got a
[66:19] whole catalog of experts that are just
[66:21] voices in my head that that just fill me
[66:24] in on all the information and all the
[66:26] updates that are going on. And it is
[66:28] remarkable the amount of technology
[66:30] that's being developed in this space
[66:32] that's going to change everything. And
[66:34] it's it's we're just waiting for that
[66:36] key unlock moment for people to kind of
[66:39] the the the usability of it to almost be
[66:42] abstracted into the way that that people
[66:44] don't even know that they're using
[66:45] Bitcoin, but it's just replaced
[66:47] everything. Kind of like how the um like
[66:49] the the physical phone lines got
[66:50] replaced by digital phone lines and
[66:52] people didn't even really notice. It'll
[66:54] just be something that happens
[66:55] abstracted behind the scenes under the
[66:57] hood and then that'll just be the new
[67:00] way of things and people won't even
[67:02] realize that they're using Bitcoin.
[67:03] People don't even realize that their
[67:04] pensions are exposed to Bitcoin now, if
[67:06] they've got any exposure to to Black
[67:07] Rockck. And it's it is kind of funny
[67:10] just to see when people when you talk to
[67:13] people realizing that like where we are
[67:15] now cuz the last last thing they heard
[67:17] was like, "Oh, Bitcoin was dying.
[67:18] Bitcoin was was 20K. Oh, Bitcoin went
[67:21] back down to 70K." And then I Yeah.
[67:24] mentioned that it's over 100K and hit an
[67:26] all-time high and people don't even it
[67:28] doesn't even register anymore.
[67:32] It's very true. It's like it's at that
[67:35] point it has been so successful over
[67:37] such a long period of time uh that they
[67:40] kind of tune out to the success of it
[67:42] and kind of not not see it anymore. As
[67:45] we seen like 2017, there was a huge
[67:47] spike in interest even though we just
[67:50] hit like not even 20,000 and now we
[67:53] hitund what was the max 12,000 13,000
[67:57] whatever and people are not even one
[68:01] third as interested as it was in 2017
[68:05] and the the the retail former was not as
[68:08] as as bigger. It's it's fascinating to
[68:11] to to see how how asleep they are. Yeah,
[68:15] it's weird because Yeah. Well, I I got
[68:17] attracted by like the original like the
[68:19] FOMO in 2021 when it was was running up
[68:22] to 60K and that was very like exciting
[68:24] and there was just madness everywhere.
[68:27] That was just before all of the FTX like
[68:29] I just got in before everything just
[68:32] blew up and started trying to promote it
[68:35] within the nuclear industry. And then I
[68:36] Yeah, you get questions like, "Well,
[68:38] what about that FDX stuff?" And
[68:41] yes, people do commit fraud, but it had
[68:43] nothing to do with Bitcoin. Bitcoin's
[68:45] just an open ledger that we can use how
[68:48] we see fit. And it's like like the
[68:51] internet. The the early days it was
[68:55] being used like like like
[68:59] it the claim that it was being used for
[69:01] nefarious things or for like message
[69:03] boards that were unsavory and whatnot.
[69:07] that proportionally in the early days.
[69:09] Yes, some of that stuff was higher like
[69:11] but now the positive uses for the
[69:14] internet are just outweigh any potential
[69:18] negatives about it allowing people to
[69:20] communicate with each other that we that
[69:22] would be communicating about things that
[69:24] that are unsavory. So it's it's going to
[69:27] be much the same in Bitcoin. Like yeah,
[69:28] in its early years proportionally
[69:30] criminals used it to buy drugs on Silk
[69:33] Road, but now Black Rockck is
[69:36] accumulating it. Governments and
[69:38] sovereign wealth funds are accumulating
[69:40] it. So it's proven itself to the point
[69:43] that that it has way more benefit to our
[69:46] society than any than the negatives and
[69:49] the perceived negatives that it has out
[69:53] there like the social discussion. So, I
[69:56] hope that more people start catching on,
[69:58] like seeing people like Daniel Batten
[70:00] out there constantly swatting FUD
[70:02] whenever it comes up whenever some
[70:06] credible institution starts uh reporting
[70:09] about Bitcoin and uses resources like
[70:14] Alex Derecon Economist. Yeah, it's uh it
[70:18] seems like we we we just have an immune
[70:20] system that just does reacts to that and
[70:24] makes Yeah,
 it makes Yeah, it just it's
[70:28] just interesting to watch and just see
[70:30] that that he just filled that role.
[70:31] Daniel just filled into that role.
 We
[70:34] have a really good immune system. It's
[70:36] it's it works on its own and it doesn't
[70:38] need anyone to
[70:41] to fill it. Um, if someone falls out,
[70:44] there's someone else coming. Uh, if
[70:47] there's a hole filling, there's someone
[70:49] that fills that hole. It's just a really
[70:52] it's a nice system.
 Yeah. When I started
[70:54] it was more like like Nick Carter was
[70:55] filling that role and now it's Daniel
[70:57] Batton's got that role. So,
 true Nick. I
[71:00] haven't heard about him since a long
[71:02] time. Has he gone into altcoins too
[71:05] much?
 I don't know. He's does his own
[71:07] thing. But like yeah, when I started in
[71:08] Bitcoin, like he had he was really
[71:10] compelling arguments and rebutting a lot
[71:12] of the mining FUD and and whatnot,
 but
[71:15] yeah, he seems to have the that torch
[71:17] has been passed on and now like Daniel
[71:18] Batten is is the the the guy when it
[71:21] comes to busting FUD and mining
[71:23] narratives.
 I had him on like just a
[71:26] week ago or something like that or two
[71:27] weeks ago. Was it was really fun talking
[71:29] with him. Um I asked all my returning
[71:32] guests the same question. Um, what have
[71:34] you learned since you have last been on
[71:36] the podcast outside of Bitcoin?
 Outside
[71:38] of Bitcoin, I learned that I am a lot
[71:41] more capable than I thought I was. But I
[71:45] just I I was content to be a lab tech
[71:49] and just kind of ride out a simple
[71:51] career for
[71:53] until I retired and just do the 9 to5.
[71:56] but then becoming a Bitcoiner and seeing
[71:58] that there's a lot grander world of
[72:00] opportunity to uh embrace and you can
[72:04] just do things and I've gone to
[72:06] conferences now and I've been speaking
[72:08] with people all over the world like
[72:10] before El Salvador last fall I was also
[72:13] in Abu Dhabi going to a nuclear
[72:15] conference and they're starting to be
[72:17] more open to these ideas like they they
[72:19] want to learn they want to understand
[72:21] that there are tools available to solve
[72:24] many of the problems that that the
[72:26] sector solves and I nobody was serving
[72:30] in the role of of promoting like this
[72:33] specific niche. So I decided that I was
[72:36] going to be the guy. I well didn't
[72:38] really decide. I just started doing it
[72:39] and then it just kind of gained its own
[72:42] momentum and
[72:45] yeah, now I I have a I've got a taste
[72:47] for for a more adventurous lifestyle and
[72:51] I I want to pursue something a little
[72:53] more broader than the laboratory. And
[72:56] yeah, like any you anybody can just
[72:58] start doing something that they're
[73:00] passionate about and God knows what uh
[73:03] opportunities will arise from it. The
[73:05] people that I've been speaking to have
[73:08] uh yeah, I've been speaking with some of
[73:10] the most intelligent and interesting
[73:12] people in the world over the last few
[73:14] years and I would not uh change a thing.
[73:19] I love that and I 100% agree with that.
[73:23] just from starting my own small podcast.
[73:25] Not only that I'm capable of doing my
[73:28] podcast and supporting free freelancers
[73:31] with that, the opportunities could come
[73:33] your way. The things that you can say no
[73:35] to that you would have said yes in an
[73:38] instant. Like there's there are
[73:40] opportunities uh now coming my way that
[73:43] I say no to two years ago. I would have
[73:47] dreamed of having that opportunity just
[73:49] because you go out there, put a proof of
[73:50] work in there and just work really hard
[73:53] and the community really appreciates
[73:56] that. So that I love that point you
[73:58] brought up here.
 Well, and you you
[74:00] create your own opportunities by putting
[74:02] yourself out there like if you hadn't
[74:04] have made the decision to go all in like
[74:06] Yeah. you wouldn't you may not have had
[74:08] the opportunities even present
[74:10] themselves to you and or you might not
[74:13] have been the person that would have
[74:15] seen or accepted that opportunity should
[74:17] have arisen. So like yeah, the bit
[74:19] Bitcoin changes people meme, it's
[74:22] definitely real. Like I am not in any
[74:24] way the same person from 5 years ago.
[74:27] Like this has been a roller coaster of
[74:29] just like a of a yeah just a like a
[74:32] going through the personality change and
[74:35] meat grinder of like what who was I
[74:38] before and now who am I now? like you
[74:40] start asking these questions when before
[74:42] it was just kind of just flowing with
[74:44] the momentum of life and and going with
[74:47] going the flow, showing up at your job,
[74:49] supporting your family, but then yeah,
[74:51] Bitcoin grabs you and it throws you into
[74:54] a whole new world where you need to find
[74:57] the best in yourself really. Yeah, we
[74:59] have an end in the podcast as you well
[75:01] know uh where the previous guest is
[75:02] asking a question for the next guest
[75:04] without knowing who the next guest is.
[75:06] And uh I I just prefaced that question
[75:09] that an Italian asked that question. Um
[75:13] he asked the question is pizza with
[75:16] pineapples acceptable?
[75:18] That is a travesty. That is
[75:21] sacrilegious. My my wife would disagree
[75:24] with me though. But yeah, I I have never
[75:27] I love pineapple, but I have never liked
[75:29] pineapple on pizza. I don't know if it
[75:31] it's just just the texture just doesn't
[75:34] jive with pizza for me. So,
[75:38] I I like a good good meat lovers myself
[75:40] with the with the mushrooms on it. That
[75:43] is that is my preferred pizza.
 Yeah,
[75:45] pineapple. I I don't like pineapples, so
[75:47] that's why I'm probably like the wrong
[75:49] person to to even ask that question. But
[75:51] like I wouldn't put pineapples also
[75:53] much.
 It's a very contentious topic,
[75:55] much like the uh the the cast iron and
[75:58] the stainless steel frying pans. like
[76:00] I've
[76:02] some it's also a good one when when the
[76:04] Bitcoiners are bored, you just bring out
[76:05] something random to argue about
 and
[76:08] Bitcoiners really like to argue about
[76:10] diet about uh
 especially like it's
[76:13] either really exciting for a few days or
[76:15] terrifying for a few days and then
[76:17] boring for months
[76:20] at least at least if you're on the price
[76:22] action and whatnot, but like if you're
[76:24] if you're paying attention to what's
[76:25] going on behind the scenes, like there's
[76:26] always something exciting and new going
[76:28] on. But but it's a it's a fun ride.
[76:33] There there are definitely seasons where
[76:34] like there's so much going on in like
[76:36] one week and then there's like a month
[76:38] where I'm like ah it's kind of calm like
[76:40] people not as interested in in Bitcoin
[76:42] and Bitcoin related topics in the
[76:43] Bitcoin community and then there's like
[76:45] two weeks where like everything seems to
[76:47] be happening in Bitcoin all at once. Uh,
[76:49] I've in in the short amount of time that
[76:52] I did my podcast, the last one and a
[76:54] half years, I've noticed many of those
[76:56] seasons. And I do prefer the calm season
[77:00] a lot because it allows to like build
[77:02] and strategize and be ready for like the
[77:04] the the hectic season. And sometimes
[77:06] it's not even
 Yeah. Yeah. And sometimes
[77:09] it's not even connected to the price
[77:11] action necessarily. So usually the price
[77:13] action is correlated to a hectic new
[77:16] season, but it's sometimes it there
[77:19] there sometimes a lot happening and the
[77:21] price not really reflects that. So it's
[77:23] it's interesting to to see that.
 I know
[77:25] it just it feels like we're all just
[77:26] waiting for like a coiled spring to just
[77:28] release its energy and nobody knows
[77:30] what's going to happen and then and then
[77:32] all a sudden price goes down like 3K and
[77:34] it's like that's not supposed to happen.
[77:37] But then just like back up the truck, do
[77:39] I have any coin coins in the in the
[77:41] cushions? sell my chairs.
[77:44] Can I take another loan?
 Yeah. Yeah.
[77:47] We're uh you definitely know you've
[77:49] crossed the chasm when you see the dip
[77:51] and you're just like, "Where's my money?
[77:53] Why don't I have any money left?" Oh,
[77:55] yes. It's all Bitcoin.
 Uh really cool.
[77:57] Thank you so much, uh Ryan, for for for
[78:00] being such an amazing guest.

[78:05] your guests.
 Thank you so much. Before I
[78:07] let you go, where can people find you
[78:09] and ask you questions? uh nuclear
[78:11] Bitcoiner on X, Noster, Brian Mloud on
[78:14] on uh LinkedIn if you more on the
[78:16] professional side, but uh yeah, that's
[78:19] where you can find me and I will be up
[78:22] to what I've been up to trying to
[78:24] penetrate the nuclear industry with some
[78:27] Bitcoin mining strategies.
