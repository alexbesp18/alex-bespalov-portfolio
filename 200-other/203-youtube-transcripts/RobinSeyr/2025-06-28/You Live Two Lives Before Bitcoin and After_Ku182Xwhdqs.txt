[00:00] This is my my mission. You know, people
[00:02] always ask, "Luka, it seems like you
[00:04] have these two lives. You're like a
[00:06] molecular biologist, but you're still
[00:08] doing this Bitcoin thing." It's like
[00:10] sailor saying, "On how many chairs are
[00:12] you sitting right now, Robin? Do you
[00:14] need three chairs or just one?" The
[00:16] production of money does not seem to
[00:19] warrant any kind of moral or ethical
[00:22] assessment. It's insane. we're talking
[00:24] about um the size of a of a state to
[00:27] then fulfill or to give the opportunity
[00:30] to people in other countries that don't
[00:33] have easy access to the dollar now they
[00:36] have through stable coins. You should
[00:38] also admit the limitations and the the
[00:41] the still kind of things that we need to
[00:43] work on and not just follow one specific
[00:46] narrative but also be open for
[00:50] criticism. That's the beauty of of
[00:52] Bitcoin basically a lifelong learning
[00:55] journey.
[00:58] [Music]
[01:00] Who are you? What are you doing? And why
[01:02] are you excited about Bitcoin?
 My My
[01:04] name is Luca. Um I grew up in the
[01:08] northern part of Italy called Alto Adij
[01:11] in a family where we spoke Italian and
[01:14] German. And then I moved to to Vienna
[01:16] for my my bachelor. So I studied uh
[01:19] there biio medicine and biotechnology.
[01:22] So I know Vienna. I know how amazing
[01:24] this place is. So I envy you Robin a
[01:27] little bit to be honest. I hope that I
[01:29] can visit you soon soon or sooner or
[01:31] later. From Vienna, I moved to
[01:35] Switzerland where I did my master's in
[01:38] molecular health sciences and I
[01:40] continued with my uh PhD in the same lab
[01:44] and um actually two and a half months
[01:48] ago I also finished my PhD
[01:51] uh and the research area was uh skin
[01:54] inflammation so attopic dermatitis. So
[01:57] this is my my basically yeah my interest
[02:01] right. So I followed this interest as a
[02:03] researcher. I still have this interest.
[02:06] I love doing research. I love molecular
[02:08] biology. And in this journey um I
[02:11] encountered Bitcoin. So now it's um
[02:14] couple of years ago. Um and I
[02:16] encountered Bitcoin. I think I already
[02:19] told this in the first podcast that we
[02:21] did this together. uh but I encountered
[02:24] uh bitcoin with an initial very simple
[02:27] question that I asked myself because uh
[02:30] when you do a PhD you earn a little bit
[02:32] of money. I wanted to save for for my
[02:34] future for a potential family and so on
[02:36] and so and so forth. Um but I realized
[02:39] that you cannot leave the money just in
[02:42] your bank. So you have to invest. And
[02:43] for me investing was something
[02:45] completely new and I had to learn all of
[02:48] it from from scratch. And I really
[02:51] really mean learning all of it from
[02:53] scratch because I had no idea what
[02:55] inflation is uh and with in this
[02:59] diversification. So you learn that you
[03:01] have to diversify uh in order to
[03:03] minimize your risk when you invest
[03:06] because you cannot save or the new
[03:08] saving is investing in a diversified
[03:11] way. And in this diversification
[03:14] journey, let's call it, I encountered
[03:16] Bitcoin. And Bitcoin is extremely
[03:19] fascinating because it forces you to ask
[03:22] very simple questions that are not
[03:24] simple at all. They're very complicated.
[03:27] For example, what is money and so on.
[03:29] And with this, I had to restudy uh
[03:32] basically all of it. And yes, this is
[03:36] not so in brief, but yeah, this is
[03:38] basically my background story. I I love
[03:41] the biology. I I don't even know if I
[03:43] asked the question uh last time, but if
[03:46] if I hadn't asked it, it's really time
[03:48] to ask it. Would you say Bitcoin is a is
[03:50] an organism? Is is something like almost
[03:53] a life force?
 Yeah. So, um there are
[03:56] already articles um about this topic,
[03:59] right? So I will not be the first one to
[04:01] say uh yes but there are some very
[04:05] fascinating parallels in that sense that
[04:08] it's um it's a it's a decentralized
[04:13] organism somehow right so you have
[04:15] different actors that play the same game
[04:19] and they live in a synergy and when you
[04:22] look out in nature you have a lot of
[04:24] things that survive uh through
[04:27] synergies. So they help each other uh
[04:30] and to to keep on moving right. So I
[04:34] would say there are for sure parallels
[04:37] uh with bi like when you want to to see
[04:41] it as an organism. Um but yeah we are
[04:44] then in the philosophical sphere right
[04:46] to to say a software open-source
[04:49] software has something to do with an
[04:51] organism is a kind of stretch but I I I
[04:54] can understand the point. Yeah. For me
[04:57] it's because it's completely
[04:59] decentralized and like of course it's
[05:02] depending on other factors. For example,
[05:06] like this the plants needs the sun and
[05:08] water to grow and the same way Bitcoin
[05:12] needs humans uh and and and people to
[05:16] use it to grow obviously but it's not
[05:20] destroyable in the same way of like uh
[05:23] if if as as long as the sun and water
[05:26] and and and and normal uh life is
[05:30] possible on planet Earth, there will
[05:32] always be some kind of plants. it's
[05:34] almost impossible to contain plants. So,
[05:38] um for me that's the the and without
[05:42] having any knowledge about biology or
[05:44] anything like that like that plants need
[05:46] sun and water that's how far my my
[05:48] knowledge goes uh on on that area. But
[05:51] in that regards for me is like Bitcoin
[05:54] is an uh own life force only because
[05:57] it's decentralized and there's no one um
[06:01] really breeding it like nobody really um
[06:04] giving it its life form. Like if we have
[06:07] like we could also make the argument
[06:09] like Apple is its own life form. No,
[06:11] like there's a management team that
[06:13] deploys that. So it gets its life form
[06:16] from a central authority that gives it
[06:20] the life form. But Bitcoin has no real
[06:23] guy or girl or management team or
[06:26] anything like that that gives it its
[06:28] life form. It has given its own life
[06:30] form
[06:32] by one origin of Satoshi Nakamoto. Then
[06:36] you can say like oh like he gave its
[06:37] life form but then like every life form
[06:41] has some origin story but then it grows
[06:44] out of that origin story. I don't know
[06:46] how how good or bad this analogy was but
[06:48] like that's how I I see it. No, I mean I
[06:51] I see also the the the point of
[06:53] adaptability. So so organisms can adapt
[06:57] according to environmental input, right?
[07:00] So this is key for survival, for
[07:04] selection if you're not able to to adapt
[07:07] uh you will die. So you will not survive
[07:10] the the the selection that the
[07:12] environment uh brings onto you. So I I I
[07:16] see that point as well that Bitcoin can
[07:18] be uh or can adapt right for example you
[07:21] had China ban the miners had to exit
[07:24] they had to moves to somewhere else. So
[07:26] in that in that sense you c you can see
[07:29] some features that an organism is having
[07:34] but humans use this tool right so we as
[07:37] a collective species as organism we are
[07:42] using this this layer and this and this
[07:44] protocol but yeah it's it's a
[07:46] fascinating um philosophical journey
[07:49] that that you can uh go on completely
[07:51] agree
 the adaptability is really
[07:53] interesting because we have seen so many
[07:55] different shifts in Bitcoin. I just
[07:57] posted I think today or yesterday the
[08:00] the uh the the post of seeing the
[08:02] Bitcoin conferences 12 years ago and and
[08:05] now because it has been around for a
[08:07] long time the Bitcoin conference and I
[08:09] was there in Vegas. It was completely
[08:11] crazy. It's it's it's a whole different
[08:13] thing when you go to a local meetup to
[08:16] versus going to the biggest Bitcoin
[08:17] conference ever with I think he claimed
[08:20] to have like 35,000 people there but
[08:22] there was a lot of people there like
[08:24] 30,000 35 whatever the number is and
[08:27] then you see the picture of like 12
[08:29] years ago with Andreas and standing in
[08:32] front of like five people and and and
[08:36] spreading the gospel of Bitcoin. Uh it's
[08:39] super interesting how it adopts. How do
[08:40] you think Bitcoin will need to adopt to
[08:44] get ready for because we're still even
[08:47] though we are have grown quite quite
[08:49] much. How do you but we still very early
[08:52] and still very small in the in the
[08:54] bigger regard. How do you think Bitcoin
[08:56] will need to adopt to be ready for like
[08:58] a billion users, two billion users,
[09:00] whatever?
 Yeah, I mean this is something
[09:02] that is very um crucial, right? So we
[09:06] are talking about scalability and uh
[09:08] again bringing bringing back how
[09:11] organisms develop over time or how they
[09:14] adjust is sometimes also just random by
[09:17] mutation. So you have mutations in your
[09:20] in the DNA and this brings a selection
[09:22] advantage or disadvantage. And maybe
[09:25] with Bitcoin you can claim somehow that
[09:28] um some soft forks or or some um some
[09:33] adjustments to the to the to the
[09:36] protocol to the software in in a in with
[09:39] with a consensus are how we can um
[09:43] adjust for the selection pressure of
[09:45] CBDC's or like some other technologies
[09:48] that are coming. I mean this is again
[09:50] very very philosophical. So you have
[09:53] also the one camp of people saying no we
[09:56] need oification
[09:57] we don't want to to adjust uh this
[10:00] software this protocol anymore it's good
[10:03] enough as it is and you had have another
[10:06] camp that that is basically saying that
[10:09] yeah okay we have the lightning network
[10:11] to to scale uh we have the main layer
[10:14] for really uh final settlements but in
[10:17] the future most likely this will not be
[10:20] possible for everyone So we need to have
[10:24] some scalability and the question is is
[10:26] how right? So how will we scale to um
[10:31] let more people join in and uh do we do
[10:34] we scale in a way that is decentralized
[10:38] or less decentralized? I think future
[10:41] will will tell. Um let's hope or let's
[10:44] hope that it's in in in a decentralized
[10:47] fashion so that um Bitcoin can stay uh
[10:51] decentralized and and secure.
 Have you
[10:54] followed the OP return limit discussion
[10:58] just very briefly? So I'm currently on a
[11:00] social media detox uh tour and uh if you
[11:04] do that uh it's fascinating um how you
[11:09] feel better but in some sense you lose
[11:12] all information so so I know it's there
[11:15] um but I don't know every nuance and
[11:18] every single single detail but maybe you
[11:21] can give me a a short update. Yeah, I'm
[11:24] always hesitant to do that because I'm
[11:26] I'm not uh technically uh involved too
[11:29] deep, but uh it's it's basically a it's
[11:35] a it's not a similar debate than the the
[11:38] block size like the block size is way
[11:40] more fundamental obviously. Um but it's
[11:43] about like what do we put on Bitcoin and
[11:45] how can we limit that and if we erase
[11:48] the limit of OP return um is that then
[11:53] putting more spam and more uh things on
[11:57] top of uh Bitcoin or maybe on the other
[12:00] side a hardcoded limit. I always from
[12:04] when coming from software development, I
[12:05] actually come from software development.
[12:08] Hardcoded limits are not always the best
[12:11] uh way to to do things and and hard code
[12:14] into uh software uh can sometimes lead
[12:18] to problems uh and and bugs down the
[12:21] line. Um my my short stance is on on on
[12:24] that we need a really good reason to
[12:28] change Bitcoin's code. If if the reason
[12:32] is not strong enough, we shouldn't do
[12:34] it. So the we we should protect the
[12:37] current state and the current state
[12:39] should only be changed if a reason comes
[12:43] on ground that is so strong that we have
[12:46] to change it. So
[12:48] if if we are in doubt we should not
[12:51] change it. If if we have a clear of like
[12:54] oh like we really have to go there then
[12:56] it does not make sense. But the the good
[12:59] thing is it's democracy you know like
[13:01] it's it's like people can uh if there's
[13:04] something implemented people can vote
[13:05] with their own note they can choose
[13:07] which which uh thing they are they are
[13:11] supporting. uh and uh if you're coming
[13:14] back to the organism um maybe there's
[13:17] something uh growing out of Bitcoin that
[13:20] uh will die maybe something grow grows
[13:22] out of Bitcoin that then this this new
[13:24] thing um so the same thing happened with
[13:27] with the I think Bitcoin Cash and and
[13:29] the block size war was way bigger than
[13:30] that like this is a very small thing
[13:32] compared to that but block size was
[13:34] showed like the the original thing
[13:37] survived and the the offspring
[13:40] the the the the mutation of it uh turns
[13:43] out to to be dead. I mean, it's not
[13:45] that, but it's like 99% of value lost.
[13:48] So, you could argue that it's that. And
[13:51] so, yeah, that's that's super
[13:53] interesting uh to to to see those
[13:56] discussions. Um but I think probably
[13:58] it's it's fine to to make some social
[14:01] media detox. I I think you you don't
[14:04] have the whole thing about Bitcoin is
[14:06] you don't have to follow the news.
[14:08] That's why we have Bitcoin. Maybe
[14:10] because we are early, you should follow
[14:12] it a little bit. Um, which you
[14:14] definitely are, but like even if you're
[14:16] like outside of of of Bitcoin and and
[14:18] you're just looking in like once a year,
[14:20] once every half year, just checking in
[14:22] how it's going. I think that's enough
[14:24] with Bitcoin. Um, because you don't have
[14:28] to keep up with daily news. That's why I
[14:29] also don't do news because it it's I
[14:31] think it's not that important with with
[14:33] Bitcoin and it it doesn't make me happy
[14:36] at all reporting news.
 Yeah. But
[14:38] sometimes, you know, you have this
[14:40] feeling that you're missing out and uh
[14:42] that's why you go there. You're
[14:43] constantly scrolling and then seeing
[14:46] what news are there and so on. But uh
[14:48] most of it is noise and that's that's
[14:50] the issue and it's it's time consuming.
[14:53] And uh yeah, I can recommend to everyone
[14:56] try it out and and see if it works for
[14:58] you. For me, it's working currently very
[15:00] well. Um and back to to to the original
[15:04] question. So the OP return now. Thank
[15:05] you for for the update. Um I think for
[15:09] Bitcoin in general moving slow and not
[15:12] breaking things is good you know so we
[15:16] we should maintain this and um that's
[15:19] also the difference between all other
[15:21] projects that claim to be faster claim
[15:24] to be whatever and they move fast and
[15:26] sometimes they break things
[15:29] basically.
 Absolutely. Um, you said also
[15:33] one thing uh with diversification. Uh, I
[15:36] don't I don't know if you're still
[15:37] diversifying. Uh, I I personally went
[15:40] completely bunkers on on Bitcoin and and
[15:42] went all in with my money and with my
[15:45] time. Uh, but it's fun that you came
[15:47] with diversification uh to Bitcoin. Uh
[15:50] and a lot of people uh alo like how do
[15:54] you see diversification now as as you
[15:57] are now a bitcoiner or like you you
[15:59] understand bitcoin uh deeply because
[16:01] before I also thought diversification is
[16:03] important and and now I'm I'm kind of on
[16:06] the opposite of like if you really want
[16:07] to achieve something diversification is
[16:10] kind of like yeah if you have a plan B
[16:13] you don't really have a plan A in that
[16:15] kind of a sense
 it's like sailor saying
[16:17] on how many chairs are you sitting right
[16:20] Now, Robin, do you need three chairs or
[16:22] just one? No. So, for me, um I came into
[16:26] all of this um just um because I wanted
[16:29] to save money, right? So that was the
[16:31] very beginning driver or let's say this
[16:35] this thing that induced my my journey
[16:39] into uh finance and everything else
[16:42] because I did not understand why I am
[16:45] kind of forced to invest to maintain my
[16:48] purchasing power over time. So this was
[16:50] my my initial um point. Um but I still
[16:56] so if if people for example think that
[16:59] company X Y Z is very interesting and um
[17:02] they really like the vision or the idea
[17:05] and uh they want to invest in that go
[17:08] for it you know do it. You you should
[17:10] you should support visions and you
[17:12] should support um companies um or ideas
[17:16] uh that you like. Now if if you if you
[17:20] just want to save, Bitcoin is now there
[17:23] as a a saving technology. So of course
[17:27] it's it's volat volatile measured in the
[17:30] US dollar, right? It's it's very
[17:33] volatile measured in different
[17:35] currencies. But the question is what do
[17:37] you use as your measuring stick? That
[17:40] was also very fascinating in my journey
[17:43] when I understood that Bitcoin is there
[17:46] now and you can use all different
[17:48] currencies to see the price of Bitcoin.
[17:52] And when you look at the chart of
[17:53] Bitcoin in in US dollar, in euro, in
[17:56] Turkish LRA, in different currencies, um
[18:01] there is a very interesting finding that
[18:05] you can that you can make is that okay,
[18:08] but what glasses am I putting on to see
[18:13] the price of Bitcoin, right? or or just
[18:17] because I'm living now in in
[18:18] Switzerland, I my my perception is Swiss
[18:22] Frank. But for other people living in
[18:25] other countries, their perception, they
[18:26] see prices, they see this these signals
[18:30] um in their local currency. And
[18:32] depending on how good or bad your local
[18:35] currency is, um the Bitcoin chart looks
[18:38] very different. That's that's also a
[18:41] very interesting observation that a lot
[18:44] of people um yeah maybe you know they
[18:49] don't look at it because they are
[18:51] trapped in their local currency monopoly
[18:55] and they are not aware of of um other um
[19:00] currencies. Um but yeah this this you
[19:03] should be aware of that and as I said
[19:05] for someone that is privileged and that
[19:08] can also withstand um 70 to 80% draw
[19:12] downs um in the long run um Bitcoin
[19:15] until now was quite a very good um
[19:18] saving technology if you want to frame
[19:21] it that way.
 Yeah, it has those two
[19:23] components of like it's a savings
[19:24] technology but it's also getting adopted
[19:27] as a savings technology. So it has this
[19:29] investing kind of behavior till it's
[19:32] actually savings technology. So uh you
[19:35] you you get the savings technology maybe
[19:38] in 40 years, 50 years, whatever the time
[19:40] frame is
 up until and until then you get
[19:44] a really good performing uh investment
[19:47] technology, but at its core at it when
[19:51] you just look at the fundamentals, it's
[19:53] a savings technology. And this is really
[19:55] hard to explain to people outside of
[19:57] Bitcoin. Like you get it, like maybe
[20:00] most of the audience gets it, but like
[20:01] it's really hard to explain it.
 Maybe
[20:03] let me let me re rephrase what I said.
[20:07] So, Bitcoin brings all the properties to
[20:10] the table that make it a very good
[20:13] saving technology. That that is maybe um
[20:17] maybe better, right? That that also
[20:19] explains the volatility and that also
[20:21] explains um this current phase that we
[20:24] are in, right? This potential
[20:27] phase of seeing a monetary
[20:31] tool or like a new type of money being
[20:34] monetized over time, right? Imagine if
[20:37] we would speedrun the development of
[20:39] gold last 3,000 year years. So maybe we
[20:44] are in in that kind of phase where we
[20:47] are going in that direction. Yeah.
 So we
[20:50] are speedr runninging the the the
[20:52] development of of of gold now with bit I
[20:55] mean bitcoin is already getting adopted
[20:58] way quicker than than gold was. I think
[21:00] gold gold leaded along long more time
[21:03] from the first discovery till like it it
[21:05] was a substantial store of value which
[21:08] which is interesting. May maybe also the
[21:10] meaning of exchange and unit of account
[21:12] side of things for Bitcoin comes way
[21:15] faster because of that.
[21:18] I that's like knowing that would be
[21:20] amazing, right? But um I think we live
[21:25] now in in in in a time where information
[21:29] can can run at the speed of light,
[21:32] right? So we we never had that.
[21:35] Previously information was going at the
[21:38] speed of horses
[21:40] or that's it. And uh living now in in a
[21:44] in a time where information can travel
[21:46] at the speed of light and also now value
[21:48] can um travel at the speed of light uh
[21:52] makes makes things very different and
[21:54] maybe also faster but maybe also more
[21:57] volatile. Right? We we don't know. But
[22:00] uh buckle up. It will be a very
[22:02] interesting journey. One one thing that
[22:04] I'm always curious with with guests that
[22:06] are returning, what kind of have you
[22:08] learned uh on on Bitcoin, around
[22:10] Bitcoin, about Bitcoin, whatever, in in
[22:12] the last year, I think it's been even
[22:14] over a year since you have last been on.
[22:16] Yeah. What what have I learned? I have
[22:18] learned that um this topic brings me
[22:22] back all the time. So it's so
[22:24] fascinating and there are so many new
[22:27] still new ideas that pop up after
[22:31] multiple years and he also just you know
[22:36] the idea of um the ethics of of money
[22:39] production you know in Bitcoin you have
[22:42] miners that find new blocks they have to
[22:44] spend energy but thinking of like money
[22:48] production as you know ethical So
[22:53] ethical problems of production have been
[22:55] assessed throughout the years in a very
[22:58] great number of industries, right? So
[23:00] ranging from I don't know agriculture or
[23:04] to to textile manufacturing in in
[23:07] especially developing countries and also
[23:10] pharmaceuticals.
[23:11] But today or or
[23:15] I think also in in the past only a very
[23:19] few industries um escape this the
[23:22] scrutiny right so of of how things are
[23:26] produced in a kind of ethical way and I
[23:29] think one of the most important um
[23:32] industries if you want to call it is the
[23:34] the production of money right so money
[23:37] is is kind of omnipresent in in our
[23:40] modern life yet the the the production
[23:43] of money does not seem to
[23:47] warrant any kind of moral or ethical
[23:49] assessment and also these kind of
[23:52] thoughts they came up uh very late in my
[23:55] journey. So you can see that
[23:58] it it never ends. It's a learning
[24:00] journey that you start and you never it
[24:05] it never ends. And as a researcher, this
[24:07] is very fascinating because I would
[24:09] characterize myself as a as a
[24:11] specialist. Um, and you can see how many
[24:18] views Bitcoin can be viewed on. You can
[24:21] view it on this okay monetary
[24:24] perspective, but then you can also look
[24:26] at it at Yeah. the the the mining right,
[24:29] the energy perspective. If you can look
[24:31] at it in the human rights perspective,
[24:34] global adoption also strategy and policy
[24:38] like game theory, the technological
[24:41] aspects. If you want there is so much to
[24:46] learn about this topic that it will be a
[24:49] lifelong journey.
[24:51] That's that's the beauty of of Bitcoin
[24:54] basically a lifelong learning journey.
[24:58] I I hope to be on that. I it's it's
[25:01] interesting the ethics of of fear that
[25:02] you bring that up because if you if you
[25:05] imagine two aliens talking to each other
[25:08] and they're discussing how monetary
[25:10] policy works on earth and they're having
[25:14] the discussion of like what is the more
[25:17] ethical money that you could use? Is it
[25:21] uh fiat money? Is it gold? Is it
[25:23] bitcoin? And what are the pros and cons?
[25:26] It really zooms out of like what are the
[25:28] fundamentals was the first principles
[25:31] and if you zoom out and from first
[25:33] principles and not from this like small
[25:37] zoomed in few of a human being you
[25:40] really see that Bitcoin is the only
[25:42] thing that is globally available has the
[25:46] perfect properties and is ethical
[25:49] because it does not exclude anyone if
[25:53] you have internet connection and a
[25:54] smartphone which more people than bank
[25:56] accounts there are there. Um you can use
[26:00] Bitcoin and bank accounts are extreme
[26:03] and fiat money is extremely
[26:06] excluding. I talked with uh a sema, an
[26:11] African woman, and she tal talked about
[26:15] the problem that when she and her
[26:20] friends have to go and spend something
[26:22] in the fiat currency, they have to ask
[26:24] the husbands because only the husbands
[26:27] have access to the bank account. And it
[26:30] was such an emotional story for me to to
[26:32] hear that and how she's gone through
[26:34] that and how Bitcoin kind of saved her
[26:36] uh from that man and also from kind of
[26:39] the the the the force behind that not
[26:42] having access to money. Um that it
[26:46] completely blew me away of like the the
[26:48] problems of fear is not just that the
[26:50] government steals from you. The problem
[26:53] of fear is way deeper. It's it's it's an
[26:55] ethical problem that that we have in our
[26:58] society. Uh it's it's almost a human
[27:01] rights problem that we have with money
[27:04] and and human rights like always like oh
[27:06] like clean water and and and and
[27:10] political topics and all those things
[27:12] usually come up but money is usually not
[27:16] discussed. I mean the human rights
[27:18] foundation with Alex Gadstein of course
[27:20] they are discussing it but like outside
[27:22] of them like the ethicala the ethical
[27:25] case for bitcoin I there should be a
[27:27] book like that like that there should be
[27:28] like you have the conservative case you
[27:30] have the progressive case for bitcoin we
[27:31] have so many different cases for bitcoin
[27:33] like I think the ethical case of bitcoin
[27:37] I it would be uh one hell of a book
[27:39] because it's it really shines a light on
[27:42] how bad fear is inherently it's it's
[27:46] It's sorry for my small rant but I this
[27:49] is a really important topic.
 I I I
[27:52] completely agree in that sense that also
[27:55] um where you born um of course the
[27:58] economic realities are one things but
[28:01] also the the monetary realities uh make
[28:04] make a lot of the economic realities and
[28:07] the social realities. And uh when you
[28:10] think I think we have approximately 160
[28:15] to 180 um global like fiat currencies
[28:20] and out of those not a lot are
[28:24] very good or or stable to to store your
[28:27] your value or to store your labor in,
[28:30] right? Um and it it it really is crucial
[28:34] for your future. And also if you think
[28:36] how many people would like to have
[28:39] access to to the dollar, you see it now
[28:42] um popping up with stable coins that
[28:45] give access to the dollar and you can
[28:48] see the demand and how much now for
[28:51] example Tedar is buying uh US
[28:53] treasuries. It's insane. we are talking
[28:55] about um the size of a of a state to
[28:59] then fulfill or to give the opportunity
[29:03] to people in other countries that don't
[29:06] have easy access to the dollar now they
[29:08] have through through stable coins and
[29:11] you can argue that our monetary system
[29:14] in in in some respects is also
[29:19] kind of it's it's neoc colonialism you
[29:22] know you have a global monitor system
[29:26] that where wealthy um industrialized
[29:29] nations stand at at the center and they
[29:34] control these monetary levers to their
[29:37] own advantage uh and they are optimizing
[29:40] also their own economic uh wealth and
[29:43] also their economic uh power. So if you
[29:46] think that the United States right they
[29:49] are um the issuer of the world reserve
[29:54] currency but to my knowledge none of the
[29:57] federal reserves mandates um extend
[30:01] beyond domestic interests right um and
[30:06] also when you look at institutions like
[30:08] the IMF and the World Bank
[30:12] history shows that they did not hesitate
[30:14] to to collaborate
[30:16] collaborate with unelected um autocrats
[30:20] and also some dictators. Uh and they
[30:23] enforced structural adjustments
[30:27] um without a popular mandate from the
[30:30] citizens living in in in those countries
[30:33] and um yeah ultimately the the the loans
[30:37] also become debt debt traps. So over
[30:41] time of course the borrower has to repay
[30:44] far more than their original sum. This
[30:48] is the the idea of of a loan and with
[30:51] interest payments um they are then also
[30:54] exceeding the initial amount and I think
[30:57] Alex Gladston you mentioned him he's
[30:59] doing an amazing uh work to showcase
[31:02] this and he also wrote a book um I think
[31:06] um it's called how the the IMF and the
[31:08] World Bank uh and and this I can highly
[31:12] recommend this book it's it's amazing
[31:14] and in in his book I think he is is
[31:17] citing that in between the 60s and 2017
[31:23] um approximately 62 or 60 trillion has
[31:27] been extracted from the developing world
[31:30] and this is equivalent to around 620
[31:36] or something like this Marshall plans in
[31:38] in today's dollar right it's it's insane
[31:41] if you think uh if you think of it yeah
[31:45] uh I just want to bring that for for
[31:47] people. It it's called uh let me quickly
[31:49] show it to you.
[31:51] That that's an interesting I I I wasn't
[31:55] even aware of that book actually. I have
[31:57] to see it. Uh how the IMF and the World
[32:00] Bank sell exploitation as development
[32:04] from Alex Glassine. That's an it's an
[32:07] interesting title right there. Hidden
[32:09] repression. Love it. I can highly
[32:12] recommend this book um because it's it's
[32:15] really based on historical facts and uh
[32:18] the sources that he gives are um are
[32:21] openly available and um yeah have a read
[32:25] you really feel the privilege when you
[32:29] live in countries that have access to
[32:32] the US dollar or or the euro or the
[32:34] Swiss Franks or the Swiss Frank. Yeah.
[32:36] Then stable coins inherently evil
[32:39] because they widen the reach of of
[32:42] exactly that system.
 Yeah. In I I would
[32:44] not you know I would not say inherently
[32:46] like they
[32:49] stable coins fulfill a purpose for
[32:52] people that would like to have access to
[32:55] dollar and uh they see the dollar as a
[33:00] very reliable and stable store of value.
[33:03] Right? So
[33:06] in inherent inherently evil is is a very
[33:10] loaded uh world but word I but I see
[33:13] where you're coming. It's basically
[33:15] giving the US another um way to have
[33:19] this privilege this extraordinary
[33:22] privilege that um they had after the
[33:26] gold standard where they basically
[33:28] coupled the dollar to the to to to oil,
[33:32] right? the petro dollar system where
[33:33] other countries needed the US dollar to
[33:38] um get energy.
[33:40] Now other countries if or other
[33:42] individuals um if they want dollars they
[33:46] can access it through stable coins and
[33:49] this um gives the US another buyer of
[33:53] their debt. So it's kind of evil but it
[33:59] fulfills a a also a kind of per reason
[34:03] there is a reason why people would like
[34:05] to have the US dollar right
 yeah in
[34:08] countries where you have inflation rates
[34:12] of I don't know 50% 100% 200%
[34:16] uh Turkey Venezuela Argentina I mean
[34:19] Argentina is now I think a little bit
[34:21] better but like in general like those
[34:23] countries is if you have such a high
[34:26] inflation rate and all of the sudden you
[34:28] get access to the US dollar
[34:31] like the
[34:33] from the Turkish LRA it's the dollar is
[34:37] almost as good as from the dollar
[34:39] Bitcoin not not not with the sovereignty
[34:42] rights not of the freedom rights not not
[34:44] with all those just from a store of
[34:46] value perspective it's way better and I
[34:51] I think from there the it's something
[34:53] good, but it's still the same failed
[34:56] system. They're just trying to like um
[34:59] like if you're allergic to apples, they
[35:02] just give you a better apple and just
[35:04] not like you should
[35:07] that it's a weird comparison, but like
[35:09] you should start eating bananas instead
[35:11] when you're allergic to apples. So it's
[35:14] like uh when when you have when you have
[35:18] such a bad system but your frame of
[35:22] reference is this is the only system
[35:24] there is you're taking the better flawed
[35:28] system instead of a not flawed system
[35:33] and uh in in I I'm really interested in
[35:36] in stable coins was too big of a topic
[35:39] in my opinion at the Bitcoin conference
[35:42] you you I if you make a social media
[35:44] detox, you might have not seen this
[35:46] video. There's a I think a two-minute
[35:47] video.
 I saw that one. That one I saw
[35:50] the important news come to you. Very
[35:52] nice.
[35:54] It's like a two-minute video where
[35:57] stable coin the word is like smashed
[35:59] together and it came a lot stable coin
[36:01] as as a as a as a topic. I think the
[36:04] only thing and and I'm curious what you
[36:06] think about that. The only thing stable
[36:07] coins will really do long term. I mean
[36:09] short term they will do actually good
[36:11] things and bad things but uh long term
[36:14] it will probably extend the life of the
[36:18] US dollar maybe the euro maybe some like
[36:21] it will extend the life of the two three
[36:24] four biggest currencies will demolish
[36:26] the value of the other currencies even
[36:29] faster because uh if if you're in Turkey
[36:33] and you have the uh free you you can
[36:36] choose freely between the US dollar the
[36:38] Turkey and Bitcoin and maybe Bitcoin
[36:41] needs a lot more education to do. So
[36:43] maybe that jump is higher, but from one
[36:46] government currency to another
[36:47] government currency, it's maybe an
[36:49] easier sell. So people will say like,
[36:52] "Oh, I I'll dict the this token because
[36:55] obviously it's doing better." And uh
[36:58] this will then even faster demolish the
[37:01] value and the trust of the Turkish l and
[37:03] all the other currencies that are flawed
[37:04] and I don't know like there are hundreds
[37:06] of currencies out there. Uh so it it
[37:09] might lead us to a world where there's
[37:11] free currencies out there and Bitcoin.
 I
[37:14] I mean this is so interesting, so
[37:17] crucial um because stable coins really
[37:21] also are kind of a threat to other
[37:25] sovereign currency monopolies, right? So
[37:28] if you look for example at Tether, I
[37:31] think in 2024 they were the the seventh
[37:35] largest buyer of US Treasury bonds. This
[37:38] is in this is insane, you know, so how
[37:41] how quick and and how large they're
[37:44] they're getting. And um also the ECB are
[37:49] already talking about okay these these
[37:51] stable coins are are kind of a threat
[37:53] and it's you know if you would open up
[37:56] all the borders now in that sense that
[37:58] you would allow your per your your your
[38:01] your citizens to pay taxes in whatever
[38:04] currency they would like to to choose
[38:07] right what do you think will happen so
[38:10] it would be a very interesting
[38:12] experiment uh in allowing people to um
[38:17] decide on their own which currency they
[38:20] would like to to own because then they
[38:24] need it, right? To to groceries or
[38:27] whatever. And maybe they also accept it
[38:28] if if we open up this this thought
[38:31] experiment. Now most likely people would
[38:34] move to to a currency or in in that and
[38:37] now we're talking about fiat currencies
[38:38] to currencies that that is more stable,
[38:41] right? It's more reliable and has the
[38:43] best rule of law system. If we talk
[38:45] about fiat, trust is also very in very
[38:49] important. And if you have kind of a
[38:53] legal framework where capital markets
[38:55] are open, where you have rule of law,
[38:58] these monetary
[39:00] networks um build up more trust than if
[39:03] you have um sovereign state and central
[39:06] or like politicians and central bankers
[39:09] like being I got you, no worries. um
[39:14] those currency monopolies will will
[39:17] collapse um collapse sooner. But now, as
[39:20] you said, you have something that is
[39:22] very geopolitically super interesting,
[39:24] something that is um decentralized and
[39:27] cannot be controlled by by no one,
[39:30] right? So, this is just there and every
[39:32] 10 minutes there is another block. And
[39:34] um this for sure will not be ignored
[39:37] because strategically it's also very
[39:39] interesting um to have something of some
[39:43] units of something that is not
[39:46] controlled by any sovereign state and
[39:48] transact value in something like this
[39:52] opens up like all the bricks discussion
[39:54] and what is China and Russia doing you
[39:56] know without all
[39:59] you you know Bitcoin is there for anyone
[40:03] you can use it. It's difficult to to
[40:06] prevent people from using it. It's
[40:08] censorship resistant. We have to live
[40:11] with that.
 The first time I ever made
[40:13] any money, I got myself from that money
[40:16] a watch. And ever since then, I collect
[40:18] time pieces to remember times where I
[40:21] achieved some milestone. That's why I
[40:23] got the Bitcoin 2025 edition when I went
[40:27] to my first ever American Bitcoin
[40:29] conference. So for me the Bitcoin
[40:31] watches from Coin Vichilan represents
[40:34] the time that we are living in. For
[40:36] every person that wears a Bitcoin watch,
[40:39] I know they are representing sound money
[40:42] to the outside world. Make sure to check
[40:45] out those amazing coin vigilante time
[40:48] pieces down in the descriptions. I love
[40:50] those watches so so much. The most
[40:53] important thing for your Bitcoin journey
[40:56] is not buying Bitcoin, but it's how to
[40:58] keep them. And yes, you have maybe the
[41:01] right tools, but how do you actually go
[41:03] ahead and stick it all together so it's
[41:05] the most secure for you personally?
[41:08] Self-custody is a deeply personalized
[41:10] journey. And the Bitcoin way is helping
[41:13] you exactly finding that correct setup
[41:16] for you personally. They're also helping
[41:19] you with securing your own cyber
[41:21] security. And if you want to go one step
[41:24] above all that, you can even get a
[41:27] consultation for a plan B residency. Go
[41:31] to the bitcoinway.com/roin
[41:35] and you will get a 30inut free
[41:37] consultation. I know how big of a hurdle
[41:40] it can be to have self-custody, but it's
[41:43] so freaking important to make that first
[41:46] step. We have to make sure it's as easy
[41:49] and simple as possible. And that's
[41:52] exactly what Bitbox did. Bitbox created
[41:55] the simplest and the easiest hardware
[41:58] wallet to use to get into self custody.
[42:01] So get yourself a Bitbox down from the
[42:04] link in the description. And when you
[42:05] use code Robin, you even get a 5%
[42:08] discount. You you nicely understated the
[42:11] the feed and trust part like if trust is
[42:14] important. I think I think it's all
[42:15] about trust.
[42:17] uh but it's and this is a crucial point
[42:20] uh which I learned from all the people
[42:22] that told me about the history of
[42:24] Argentina and uh about the history of
[42:27] inflation in general but Argentina was
[42:29] very nicely covered on this podcast
[42:31] already with multiple guests that have
[42:33] gone through the history and also lived
[42:35] through the history there once and what
[42:38] I've learned from that is like once
[42:39] trust is gone
[42:42] you you it's it's gone like it's a
[42:44] switch that you you you you put on and
[42:47] all of the sudden like everyone is
[42:49] flocking out and it's a matter of weeks,
[42:52] days, sometimes even hours for millions
[42:56] and billions to disappear in the
[42:58] monetary system. And we have so many
[43:01] examples of that. I mean, if you just
[43:04] study the history of Argentina and the
[43:07] monetary system over the last 50 years,
[43:09] you've seen how many currencies they
[43:11] have gone through, how often they have
[43:13] to reinvent themselves in the currency
[43:16] to regain trust.
 Mhm.
 And it's
[43:20] fascinating for me first of all that the
[43:23] trust is going so quickly, but then the
[43:25] people trust this new thing that's not
[43:27] different at all. They always promise
[43:30] that it's different, but it's never
[43:31] different. Uh so I don't know. It's uh I
[43:35] I have like when I look at all those
[43:38] things going on, I'm like eventually
[43:40] everything will lead to Bitcoin. Like
[43:43] all all those things lead to Bitcoin.
[43:46] But then I also see how people just
[43:48] trust the next fiat currencies that they
[43:50] put a new name on there. And I'm like, h
[43:53] how did they brainwash people to just
[43:56] like trust this new thing even though
[43:58] the old thing just crashed? If I buy uh
[44:01] a car from a manufacturer and it just
[44:04] explodes in the middle of the road and I
[44:06] somehow survive it, I will not go ahead
[44:09] and buy from the same manufacturer
[44:11] again. Like that seems that seems
[44:13] ridiculous.
[44:15] Yeah, I could I mean I I agree. Trust is
[44:18] crucial especially when we are talking
[44:20] about money, right? Trust is completely
[44:22] central and also when we talk about
[44:24] Bitcoin, trust is super essential. Also
[44:27] when we talk about gold, trust is super
[44:29] essential. But in what are we trusting?
[44:31] Right? So we are trusting in specific
[44:34] properties that make this tool this this
[44:38] type of money desirable for other people
[44:42] to engage in trade.
[44:45] Fiat currencies of course are also based
[44:47] on trust but they are also enforced by
[44:51] your your sovereign state. So in in some
[44:54] scenarios you are forced to go again to
[44:57] the same auto
[45:00] like car dealership and drive down the
[45:04] road and the car explodes again because
[45:08] you have to use this currency to uh pay
[45:12] taxes and to to live in in that local
[45:16] monopoly. This is why I think um now we
[45:21] are living in a very interesting
[45:25] new scenario where it's very difficult
[45:29] for sovereign states to also control all
[45:33] the
[45:35] you know capital controls are crucial
[45:38] when you're when your state is going
[45:40] through some issue.
[45:42] uh then you're getting in with capital
[45:45] controls. You're restricting also the
[45:47] amount of dollars and foreign currencies
[45:48] people can hold. Um assets people can
[45:51] hold and so on. Now Bitcoin comes in as
[45:54] this new tool that is not impossible. Um
[45:59] let's say it's it's extremely difficult
[46:02] to control but you still can build a lot
[46:05] of hurdles around it to make it much
[46:07] more difficult. Um but there are ways
[46:11] you know you just need 12 to 24 words
[46:15] and you can cross a border and you're
[46:17] gone. And um this automatically also
[46:20] gives more responsibility
[46:23] to um the individuals that are
[46:28] responsible
[46:29] for the stability of the currency,
[46:32] stability of the of politics of the
[46:35] whole society. So it just the existence
[46:38] of Bitcoin is kind of a
[46:41] fitness program if you want to call it
[46:43] like this or um for the people in charge
[46:47] to do a good job because if they don't
[46:49] do a good job um if people are aware of
[46:53] this new technology um there is now a
[46:56] kind of escape and um which is very
[46:59] interesting you know so it it it kind of
[47:01] also helps our current monetary system
[47:05] by existing
[47:07] If if you if you think like this,
 it's a
[47:09] bit interesting.
[47:11] It's also the the the implications of of
[47:16] having Bitcoin coexisting
[47:20] probably now for like now already for 16
[47:23] years, but like probably now for a few
[47:25] more years, maybe a few more decades to
[47:28] come. um with that fiat system um and
[47:32] having that parallel comparison and
[47:35] having people
[47:37] like uh you and me and many others that
[47:41] already see and already live partially
[47:43] or like almost fully in in Bitcoin and
[47:46] then also seeing how people mostly or
[47:50] solely live in in the field system and
[47:52] how they develop. It's just such an
[47:55] interesting time to be alive and and and
[47:56] and see that developments.
 But that's
[47:59] also why in in my my opinion, education
[48:03] is key. You know, education is still the
[48:06] biggest need in my opinion. And this is
[48:09] why I'm I'm still here trying to to
[48:11] contribute and and doing my part because
[48:15] people spend let's say 40 years earning
[48:19] money but they do not spend maybe one
[48:24] single hour in trying to learn about
[48:27] money and if they would do this um they
[48:31] would learn a lot you know I don't know
[48:34] if they would then also um see Bitcoin
[48:37] as a potential solution. It's up to
[48:39] them. Um but they just learning about
[48:43] money is so crucial and this is why um
[48:47] this is my my mission. You know people
[48:49] always ask Luka it seems like you have
[48:52] these two lives. You're like a molecular
[48:55] biologist but you're still doing this
[48:57] Bitcoin thing. I mean what what why are
[49:00] you doing this? and and I think it's so
[49:03] important to educate people about the
[49:06] importance of this tool of money. Um
[49:11] because we need it and because it's
[49:15] really really important.
 I love this uh
[49:18] quote from Sailor. Uh I just looked it
[49:20] up. You will spend 40,000 hours of your
[49:23] life trying to make money. It's
[49:25] worthwhile to spend a 100 hours figuring
[49:28] out how to keep it.
[49:30] exactly how to keep it,
[49:34] why you even need to invest it. You
[49:36] know, those are the very simple
[49:38] questions that not a lot of people ask,
[49:41] but also because they don't have any
[49:44] mental space, right? You come home after
[49:47] work, you're tired, you just turn on the
[49:49] TV, that's it. But podcast like like
[49:53] yours and and others are are so
[49:55] important exactly for this purpose. you
[49:58] know, if someone is listening now for
[49:59] the first time and they're like, "Okay,
[50:02] cool. I'm I'm learning about money, yes,
[50:05] continue, you know, and whatever you
[50:08] think about Bitcoin at the moment, um,
[50:10] that's fine. Just study this topic and
[50:14] then come to your own conclusions.
[50:16] That's that's the key. That's and and be
[50:18] skeptic." Like the more
[50:21] skeptic you are, the better.
[50:23] And I'm over halfway through my
[50:27] contribution to contribute over 100
[50:29] hours of Bitcoin podcast to the
[50:31] community. I think I have like now 500
[50:34] what is it 15 or 514 episodes with
[50:37] yours. Each is like I don't know 1 hour
[50:40] one and a half hours long. So uh I'm I'm
[50:42] I'm I'm soon in like one two years uh
[50:45] coming to this 1,000 hours of Bitcoin
[50:48] cont hours contributed to the community.
[50:51] I'm looking forward to like I'm probably
[50:52] like make a small party.
[50:55] It's crazy fun.
 But very good. I mean
[50:58] I'm you know seeing your journey uh
[51:01] Robin also uh was super cool. You know
[51:04] seeing you emerge as a new podcaster and
[51:07] doing this you know what you guys are
[51:09] doing it weekly. No no no I'm doing it
[51:12] daily. Boom. I was like let's go. I I
[51:17] love I love it. someone else would come
[51:19] and do it like hourly.
[51:24] He he came, saw, and did it daily.
[51:30] Awesome. Uh maybe a good point to ask
[51:34] you um because you're doing a lot of
[51:36] things also in Bitcoin with Bitcoin
[51:37] talents with Bitcoin institution. Maybe
[51:39] you can give us some some overview of
[51:41] what you're doing actually in Bitcoin
[51:43] and how you contribute there.
 Yeah. So
[51:46] as I said right, education in my opinion
[51:48] is still the biggest need uh for sure
[51:52] and um I throughout my journey I wanted
[51:55] to contribute. So what I did in the last
[51:58] 3 years I was first part of the Bitcoin
[52:01] balance program which is a um 18week
[52:05] Bitcoin mentoring program organized by
[52:08] the Frankfurt School of Finance. So I
[52:11] did the first cohort and since then I
[52:14] was a mentor and the topics covered
[52:17] there are bitcoin only and um you go
[52:21] through everything you go through the
[52:22] techn technology you make your first
[52:25] transaction also on the lightning
[52:27] network you um set up a wallet you
[52:30] understand the cryptography behind it um
[52:33] you also study the very important topic
[52:36] of money um you look at our current
[52:39] system how money is created. Um you look
[52:43] also throughout history what types of
[52:45] money people used. Um you also go
[52:48] through all the several use cases of
[52:50] Bitcoin also the regulatory landscape
[52:53] etc etc. Uh but the most fascinating
[52:56] thing why I did it uh the whole time
[52:59] because this was I did not get any money
[53:02] for mentoring um I did this on my my
[53:04] free time um is the people around the
[53:08] world. So this was something that was um
[53:12] uh you did not have to pay anything and
[53:14] it was on Zoom. So um the network that I
[53:18] built and also all the interesting
[53:20] people that talked about their own
[53:22] experience this was very very uh
[53:25] valuable but it is now sadly uh
[53:28] discontinued. Um but there are also
[53:32] already talks that other organizations
[53:36] will continue with it. But the Frankfurt
[53:38] School of Finance, the blockchain center
[53:41] had a change in in the in the leading
[53:45] teams or in in the seale position
[53:48] basically and the new director said or
[53:50] has another vision. Um he's also a
[53:53] little bit controversial in the Bitcoin
[53:56] in the German speaking Bitcoin
[53:57] community. So his name is Copia
[54:00] Gayok. So you can look him up and also
[54:03] look um up his his podcast interviews.
[54:06] So his stance towards Bitcoin is um yeah
[54:10] rather let's say negative and this is
[54:13] why also um I I people saw saw this
[54:17] coming but I would say overall it's a
[54:19] complete success story because more than
[54:22] 600 people
[54:25] yeah more or less um around the whole
[54:28] world uh were able to to get this
[54:30] education and they are out there and
[54:33] maybe educating um other people right
[54:36] And since then I also did some personal
[54:39] seminars and talks. I was invited also
[54:41] at universities where I talked about the
[54:44] topic of money. And um currently um what
[54:49] I'm also um where I'm also involved is
[54:52] in in the buildup of the Swiss uh
[54:56] Bitcoin institute which is an initiative
[54:58] that um was started by uh Marcus Dap, a
[55:02] Bitcoiner here in Switzerland. And the
[55:05] main goal is to basically become a
[55:09] independent
[55:10] go-to place for um people in government,
[55:14] in corporate or also in the nonprofit
[55:17] sector um who who take a strategic
[55:20] decision on on behalf of their um
[55:23] organization and they would like to and
[55:26] Bitcoin keeps popping up, right? So,
[55:28] Bitcoin keeps swapping up. Bitcoin keeps
[55:30] swapping up and maybe they would like to
[55:33] know more or they are wondering okay is
[55:36] it important for us or not and why and
[55:39] is exactly in such situations um people
[55:42] still do not have many places to to go
[55:46] to and they also do not listen to to
[55:49] Bitcoin podcasts as yours. I'm sorry,
[55:52] Robin. I hope that they do, but um they
[55:56] also don't go to to meetups to learn or
[55:59] they also don't have time to read a
[56:01] book. And in those specific occasions um
[56:05] those people are usually used to to look
[56:08] around for kind of professional analysis
[56:12] and you know reports and like expert
[56:15] opinions that can help them to to
[56:18] basically do their job. And this is the
[56:21] focus of the Swiss Bitcoin Institute.
[56:24] And we will most likely cover a broad
[56:26] range of um Bitcoin topics with also
[56:30] regular research um offering as well as
[56:33] different educational formats uh
[56:36] suitable for these decisions decision
[56:39] makers. And I think it would be very
[56:42] interesting to maybe also have an
[56:44] interview with with Marcos um that he
[56:46] for sure can talk much more about the
[56:48] Swiss Bitcoin Institute. I'm there to
[56:51] help. I'm there to to support him. Um
[56:54] also with no monetary interest. Uh but
[56:57] as I said, education is still key and
[57:00] this Swiss Bitcoin Institute literally
[57:03] fills in this this perfect spot. Yeah,
[57:07] I always say that if if you are in like
[57:11] we all have different talents, we all
[57:12] have different things we can do. But if
[57:15] you want to help Bitcoin, the most
[57:17] important thing is education in the next
[57:21] 5 to 10 years. Yes, we also need
[57:23] engineers to build out infrastructure to
[57:25] build out second layers, third layers,
[57:27] the ecosystem, apps, interfaces, all
[57:30] those things. Um we need sales people,
[57:32] we need uh support people, we need all
[57:35] different range of careers in Bitcoin.
[57:38] But the most important one is education
[57:41] because this is what brings people in.
[57:44] This is what uh keeps people in. This is
[57:47] what actually educates people why
[57:50] Bitcoin and this is the most important
[57:53] thing that we need for Bitcoin in the
[57:56] next 5 to 10 years. Everything else is
[57:59] downstream of that. So like if we are
[58:02] educating the world the best way
[58:05] possible on Bitcoin, the engineers will
[58:08] come and build things, the sales people
[58:10] will come and sell things, the the
[58:12] service providers will come, the support
[58:14] people will come, all those things will
[58:17] come downstream of that. So I I always
[58:20] love every single educational
[58:24] um channel, platform, event, institute,
[58:29] whatever you have. Um because this is
[58:32] the most important thing you can
[58:34] possibly do for Bitcoin right now.
 Yeah,
[58:39] I amen. I completely agree. And also um
[58:42] what is crucial in my opinion um coming
[58:45] also from a from a scientific background
[58:48] is the way you educate. So the way you
[58:52] educate and also should should in my
[58:55] opinion be kind of objective. you know,
[58:57] you should also admit the limitations
[59:00] and the the the still kind of things
[59:02] that we need to work on and not just
[59:05] follow one specific narrative but also
[59:08] be open for criticism and be open for
[59:12] other opinions. So for example, as I
[59:15] mentioned this Copia Gayor, he brings in
[59:18] other opinions and other viewpoints
[59:20] which are very crucial which need to be
[59:23] settled in kind of debates and um the
[59:26] the the person or or the the group that
[59:29] brings um the best facts to the table or
[59:33] the best evidence to the table. Um this
[59:36] is how we progress. I mean this is also
[59:38] how science progresses, right? So we
[59:41] never have the truth. We are in search
[59:44] of the truth by falsifying what we know
[59:47] at this moment. And I would like to
[59:50] bring also this way of doing research uh
[59:54] more into the Bitcoin ecosystem. Be
[59:57] objective um as much independent as as
[60:01] you can. Of course um once you once you
[60:04] are in Bitcoin also invested you have a
[60:07] bias 100%.
[60:10] But be aware of this, right? Be aware of
[60:12] this and um admit it and see what the
[60:16] the other position brings to the table
[60:18] and and you can you can then argue in in
[60:21] a friendly and polite way.
 That's that's
[60:25] a good thing about Bitcoin. There are so
[60:27] many different voices in there. Of
[60:29] course, you can listen to one voice, but
[60:31] like every there's there's the fact that
[60:34] there's so much fighting going on inside
[60:37] of Bitcoin is for me a very healthy sign
[60:41] of many different opinions in there. I
[60:44] mean, my my favorite example and and
[60:46] maybe people are tired of me bringing it
[60:48] up, but the diet thing with like we have
[60:50] carnivore and and plant-based. Um we we
[60:53] have so many different uh we we we are
[60:56] talking about if we should use sunscreen
[60:58] or not.
[61:00] Exactly. It it it it goes to so it goes
[61:05] to so many different layers
[61:08] that it's really interesting because we
[61:10] have so many different perspectives in
[61:12] Bitcoin.
[61:13] I I I don't worry too much that we don't
[61:16] have enough different opinions in in
[61:20] Bitcoin, but we have to make them
[61:22] louder. We have to uh amplify all those
[61:26] different voices and different opinions
[61:28] inside of Bitcoin. So yeah, is education
[61:31] is a education is a a huge uh
[61:34] responsibility of each and every one of
[61:36] us Bitcoiners. I I feel like
 I I can
[61:39] sign I can sign it and I'm on team put
[61:42] on sunscreen.
[61:44] I I also put on sunscreen just because
[61:46] my my my my skin really does not like
[61:50] sun apparently. I I get red massively
[61:53] and sometimes I just want to go into the
[61:55] sun and don't don't want to burn. Maybe
[61:58] I have to There are the people like oh
[62:00] like you have to slowly get there and
[62:01] like ah I don't know wearing a cap maybe
[62:04] all the time. There's different
[62:06] solutions. Um, other topic. Are you team
[62:09] carnivore or plant-based or something in
[62:11] between?
[62:13] I'm team um do whatever you want and uh
[62:17] just don't bother me. That's the most
[62:20] important team I'm in. I can completely
[62:23] understand where um vegetarian people
[62:26] come from or vegan people come from. Um
[62:29] yeah,
 sounds like you're omnivore.
[62:35] Um really cool. Then one one more thing
[62:38] I I want to get to uh before we end even
[62:40] though we are already over one hour but
[62:43] um how do you look at all those
[62:45] institutional adoption of of Bitcoin?
[62:47] How do you see the the this progression
[62:50] of like we have more and more
[62:52] institutional money we have more and
[62:53] more companies in there and it's kind of
[62:55] the individual is is is getting out of
[62:58] the out of the focus a little bit.
[63:01] Um, yeah. So, I think if you have an
[63:06] asset that is potentially becoming a new
[63:10] type of of money or a new type of medium
[63:13] of exchange, um, this is something that
[63:17] you would kind of expect. Uh, it would
[63:20] be very weird if institutions,
[63:22] governments, um, Wall Street, uh,
[63:26] whoever would not jump on this train. Um
[63:30] for me um I see this um I observe this
[63:34] um I'm to be honest my opinion is
[63:38] let's have a look of of course it's kind
[63:42] of crazy to see how much is being
[63:44] accumulated by single entities. It's
[63:47] also kind of scary and crazy to see how
[63:50] much single entities uh store like also
[63:55] for other people, right? For ETFs, I
[63:58] think Coinbase uh stores the Bitcoin
[64:00] somewhere if if I'm still up to date.
[64:03] So, um there are very big and large um
[64:07] honeypotss that no one knows, right?
[64:10] Could be kind of attacked. There is a
[64:14] very big financial incentive now to do
[64:16] that. They for sure will have their um
[64:19] security and their precaution there. But
[64:23] if something happens and those uh
[64:25] honeypots or those um those honeypots
[64:28] where a lot of bitcoin are stored will
[64:30] be attacked, this will do a lot to to
[64:33] the fiat price in bitcoin. So we will
[64:36] have a large large draw down. But um if
[64:40] Bitcoin stays decentralized and secure
[64:42] and especially if you have the ability
[64:46] to self custody as a single individual
[64:50] and this property is still there um then
[64:53] I don't see any issue in the long run.
[64:58] That's my take. So self custody and the
[65:01] possibility to hold your own keys is one
[65:06] of the most important properties that
[65:10] Bitcoin brings to the table in my
[65:12] opinion combined with of course um
[65:16] digital scarcity right Bitcoin was the
[65:19] first
[65:21] time we were able to have scarcity in
[65:25] the digital realm. an email. I send you
[65:28] an email. You have the information. I
[65:29] have the information. Bitcoin. I send
[65:31] you Bitcoin. I don't have it anymore.
[65:34] So, this is my take on on that. Would
[65:37] you agree
[65:41] 100% with especially
[65:44] um for me always important is
[65:48] so the only concern I really have if
[65:50] this institutional thing is where we
[65:53] build also out consumer goods like I I
[65:58] think borrow borrowing against a bitcoin
[65:59] can be a very good idea. Um, but at the
[66:03] same time, if we all borrow our stack
[66:06] out and give it to institutions and get
[66:09] feared in return, we don't have the
[66:11] Bitcoin anymore. If we all put Bitcoin
[66:13] in ETFs, we don't have the Bitcoin
[66:15] anymore. If we all like have Bitcoin on
[66:17] exchanges uh and use it for financial
[66:20] products, we don't have the Bitcoin
[66:22] anymore. So I just want to always make
[66:25] sure we increasing the number of bitcoin
[66:28] held by institutions uh
[66:31] by individuals and decrease the amount
[66:34] of bitcoin held by institutions and and
[66:37] this is very crucial in my opinion for
[66:40] bitcoin long term even though I don't
[66:42] see any like 70% or so of all bitcoin
[66:46] are held by individuals. So most of the
[66:50] bitcoin are actually held by individuals
[66:53] and uh only uh the the minority of the
[66:57] bitcoin are held by institutions.
[67:00] If that flips completely on its head
[67:02] which it could um this would be a sign
[67:06] for me of like okay maybe we have to
[67:09] really push harder for like in
[67:11] individuals holding their own keys.
[67:13] But I think it will never be a risk for
[67:17] Bitcoin. It's just something I'm I'm
[67:20] just very I just really want to push
[67:22] people that they have their own keys and
[67:25] they have the sovereignty rights and
[67:27] that the core ethos of Bitcoin is not
[67:29] getting lost. Even though even if it
[67:31] gets lost, I don't think it's a danger
[67:35] for Bitcoin and I don't think it's a
[67:37] danger if you hold your own keys. I
[67:40] think that will always be possible and
[67:42] it's always something there. I love the
[67:44] email example also what you what you
[67:46] gave. I would also add one thing because
[67:50] holding your own keys comes with a risk
[67:53] and comes also with kind of um you need
[67:57] to really be aware and be very
[68:00] responsible, right? And um our we live
[68:03] in a world where um comfort and giving
[68:07] away responsibility
[68:09] um is is kind of promoted or is is seen
[68:14] as not not a lot of not a big issue. So
[68:19] if we would move in a direction where
[68:21] more institutions would custo
[68:26] um one solution that I would see is
[68:29] still a proof of reserve but proof of
[68:31] reserve um that you could verify 100% in
[68:36] in your sovereign way that this
[68:39] institution where you are willing and
[68:41] you're giving away the responsibility
[68:45] is actually holding um the key or or
[68:49] basically the access to to the Bitcoin
[68:52] for you. I I see that also as a very
[68:56] important feature that Bitcoin brings
[68:59] that gold did not have. Right? So gold
[69:02] the um ability to have proof of reserve
[69:06] for gold is like physically going there
[69:09] counting the bars and hoping that those
[69:12] bars are actual gold and are not kind of
[69:15] modified. Yeah,
[69:18] I think that's a good point. Uh, I think
[69:20] it's a it's a how should I say it? I
[69:23] think it's a I think we can let it stand
[69:26] like that.
[69:29] Let's let's see what the comments will
[69:31] say if we actually can't let it stand
[69:33] like this. But I'm I'm very happy to to
[69:36] hear other opinions. But I would say
[69:39] having the ability to do proof of
[69:41] reserve in in this digital way. Of
[69:44] course you have to trust what you see on
[69:46] your screen. But if you can do it on
[69:48] your own with your own note and stuff
[69:50] might help, but hold your own keys. I
[69:54] also am a fan of that.
 And there are
[69:57] many different uh middlewares of that.
[70:01] There's like this full on you keep it at
[70:03] exchange. Then there is like exchanges
[70:06] but with proof of reserves. Then is like
[70:09] collaborative multi- signature uh
[70:12] multisig setups where maybe they hold
[70:16] some key and you hold some keys. There's
[70:18] multi- signatures I don't recommend them
[70:20] but uh there's multi signatures where uh
[70:23] the other institutions hold more keys
[70:25] than you hold. So you cannot make any
[70:28] mistakes basically and you still have a
[70:30] key. um which I don't know uh you can
[70:34] also have it on exchange but it's it's
[70:36] it's better than having it on exchange.
[70:38] It's better also to just proof of
[70:39] reserve because you actually have a key.
[70:41] Uh and then there's the uh multi-
[70:44] signature setup where you give one key
[70:47] maybe of five or maybe three keys away
[70:50] and you have the other ones and then
[70:52] there's of course the multi- signature
[70:54] or single signature where you have all
[70:56] the keys or the one key that signs it
[70:58] up. Uh and also in that in situation
[71:02] there's also many different variants of
[71:03] of how you do it. Uh do you give like a
[71:06] key to like your dad? Do you give a key
[71:09] to to uh the bank deposit box? Do you
[71:12] give a key to some friend? Uh do you
[71:14] give someone a key that don't even like
[71:18] they don't even realize that they have a
[71:20] key? So like sneaker like there are many
[71:23] different I heard so many crazy stories
[71:25] of multi signature. I I I could make a
[71:28] whole episode around that. So, there are
[71:30] different variations of
[71:33] uh sovereignty and I just want to push
[71:36] people as far as possible to that side.
[71:39] That's that's just that's just me. But
[71:42] for example, like uh if if I talked with
[71:45] my my grandma doesn't have Bitcoin, but
[71:47] if she's like, "Oh, like how Robin, how
[71:50] should I hold Bitcoin?" I I will not
[71:52] tell her about five key multi signature.
[71:55] I don't know. like maybe I get her a a
[71:57] bit key, maybe maybe I hold it for her,
[72:01] maybe uh we have a multi- signature
[72:03] setup with collaborative like unchained
[72:05] or cast or something like that. Uh maybe
[72:07] I send her to the Bitcoin ways like
[72:09] there are many different avenues.
[72:12] Um and that's a good thing that we have
[72:16] many uh different options in here.
 Yeah.
[72:19] No, I I I completely agree with you and
[72:21] also just, you know, the possibility to
[72:23] then really be completely sovereign over
[72:26] time might make more or less sense
[72:30] depending on political circumstances,
[72:33] depending on like social circumstances
[72:35] and so on. So just the possibility
[72:39] to be 100%
[72:42] um sovereign is so important and so
[72:45] crucial. Um, that's also I why I
[72:48] understand you pushing to the most
[72:51] self-s sovereign way as possible. But
[72:54] people could argue, you know, look, I
[72:57] live in Switzerland. You know,
[73:00] Switzerland is at the moment
[73:02] politically, socially, economically put
[73:06] in an extremely or super nice condition.
[73:09] So I I trust this framework and um I
[73:13] also am completely fine by giving away
[73:17] my sovereignity and holding it through
[73:19] whatever custody model and which is
[73:21] based in Switzerland for example but
[73:24] suddenly maybe after 50 years political
[73:29] movements change social issues arise and
[73:33] then you're like okay I I don't like
[73:35] this very much have I still the
[73:38] possibility or is my setup set up in
[73:41] such a way that I can again access my my
[73:45] my wealth right in in in a fast and easy
[73:48] way in case of danger and so on. So we
[73:52] come back again about also being this
[73:54] this flexibility to now just have those
[73:59] 12 24 words in your mind and go away in
[74:05] a worst case scenario. Of course, let's
[74:08] hope that this will not happen and I'm a
[74:11] fan of trying to avoid this as much as
[74:13] possible, but um the possibilities here.
[74:18] Then also comes the reality of even even
[74:21] though Bitcoiners don't like politics as
[74:24] much, we actually have to see politics
[74:27] and see
[74:29] what are we doing. Um
[74:32] like what is politics doing to me? what
[74:34] is politics doing to my Bitcoin? And are
[74:38] we headed for war? Are we headed for
[74:40] something else? Um because these are all
[74:42] important questions and if you're not
[74:45] aware of what is currently going on in
[74:48] the world in politics,
[74:50] um and you just say like, "Oh, I have
[74:52] Bitcoin. I don't care."
[74:55] You're a little bit naive because those
[74:58] politicians have the power of sending
[75:02] you to prison. they have the power to
[75:05] get you to engage in a war even though
[75:08] if you don't like it and so I think I
[75:11] think the uh it's completely different
[75:14] it's completely derailed from from my
[75:16] original thing but I think having an eye
[75:20] being an observer what's going on a
[75:22] political level and seeing like how safe
[75:25] and stable my own country is and what
[75:27] threats are there on my own country and
[75:29] Switzerland is a I think like a very
[75:32] good country in that regard or stable
[75:35] and politically um is is very important.
[75:39] I mean we have Ukraine, we have so many
[75:41] different examples of that.
 Yeah. Yeah.
[75:43] But and I would just argue against this
[75:46] point that or not against but say I want
[75:48] to say that you know politicians should
[75:51] um represent you. You know this is kind
[75:54] of very this ideal um saying but it
[75:59] should be like this. So they should re
[76:01] represent your interest and should
[76:04] follow um the the vote or the mandate. I
[76:08] mean don't get me wrong I I you know I'm
[76:12] originally from Italy so I'm I'm saying
[76:14] this and and smiling at the same time
[76:17] because I also know um how reality is
[76:21] playing out in front of our eyes. Um
[76:24] yeah, but we we should be aware of this
[76:27] and um yeah, also educate about this
[76:29] topic. But this brings us to a whole new
[76:32] tangent.
[76:34] We already have topics for the the third
[76:36] podcast, I guess. Um I asked each and
[76:39] every one of my returning guests, uh
[76:41] what have you learned since you've last
[76:43] been on the podcast outside of Bitcoin?
[76:46] Yes. So I finished my PhD, right? So it
[76:49] would be kind of weird as a researcher
[76:53] if you would not have something to tell
[76:56] and um what we learned is um very
[77:00] interesting in that sense that we now
[77:03] have a new pathway that now it's getting
[77:07] molecular like it's getting deep in the
[77:09] molecular biology topics but I will be
[77:11] brief. So we discovered a new
[77:14] interesting molecular pathway in attopic
[77:17] dermatitis that might be interesting to
[77:20] to target in the future with with a new
[77:23] drug. Uh because we saw that um we have
[77:26] a down reggulation of uh receptors that
[77:30] are crucial for the signaling and this
[77:32] signaling is crucial for um regeneration
[77:36] of the epidermis which is the outermost
[77:39] layer of the skin. I will keep it in
[77:42] this box. But of course doing a PhD um
[77:47] in molecular biology or in general um
[77:50] you learn a lot and this is the the
[77:52] research aspect uh besides all the soft
[77:55] skills that you also learn how to to
[77:58] move in academia and so on.
 It's the
[78:02] it's something where I'm like oh like
[78:04] what what are those words?
[78:08] This was the same reaction uh with a lot
[78:10] of friends that I invited for my
[78:12] defense. So usually you have the first
[78:15] slide that is a very um brief
[78:18] introductory you know about the skin how
[78:20] the skin is built. it's the largest
[78:22] organ of or of the human body and so on.
[78:26] And since and from slide two onwards,
[78:29] they said, "Okay, I know that you're
[78:31] talking English, but I didn't understand
[78:35] one single single word.
 It's English,
[78:38] but I don't understand this this
[78:40] English."
[78:42] Technical terms. Just technical terms.
[78:44] But to the fellow biologists and
[78:46] researcher out there, I got you.
[78:50] I love that. Um, really cool. We have an
[78:53] end as you know from in the podcast
[78:55] where the previous guest is asking a
[78:57] question for the next guest without
[78:58] knowing who the next guest actually is
[79:00] and the previous guest ask you the
[79:01] question. What do you love more than
[79:04] Bitcoin?
 I mean this is very easy. Um,
[79:07] family, friends,
[79:10] my girlfriend,
[79:13] people, your time is scarcer, more
[79:17] precious than Bitcoin. value it. Learn
[79:21] that you should value it. And this is
[79:24] the most important thing I think.
 I 100%
[79:29] agree with that and and and really
[79:31] beautiful. I think the perfect way to to
[79:33] end this amazing conversation, this
[79:35] amazing podcast. Thank you so much. Uh
[79:37] Luca, before I let you go, where can
[79:39] people find you, ask you questions, and
[79:40] and and reach out to you.
 Yeah, thank
[79:42] you, Robin, for having me again. And now
[79:45] we can we can see if people agree with
[79:48] the high expectation that that we set at
[79:51] the very beginning. Um yeah people can
[79:55] find me um I think on LinkedIn is the
[79:58] easiest way. So I said I am doing a
[80:00] social media detox but uh you can still
[80:03] find me um on LinkedIn. You can also
[80:05] reach out there. Um, I also linked uh to
[80:09] a medium article that I wrote which is a
[80:12] very nice 20 minutes read also for
[80:15] people that are early beginners. You you
[80:17] can find that one also um on LinkedIn.
[80:21] And yeah, in general if if there are
[80:23] people in Switzerland that are also in
[80:24] the pharmaceutical scene or in in in
[80:28] industry, reach out. Uh let's grab a
[80:31] coffee and talk about uh Bitcoin and and
[80:33] science. Thank you very much, Robin.
[80:36] Thank you so much, Luca. And also, thank
[80:37] you so much for everyone that is
[80:38] watching and listening for joining us
[80:40] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
[80:43] with another episode. Bye-bye.
