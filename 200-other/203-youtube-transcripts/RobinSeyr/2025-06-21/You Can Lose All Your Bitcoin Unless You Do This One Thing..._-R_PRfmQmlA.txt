[00:00] 10 years ago, it's like insanely
[00:02] complicated. So many soap stories on
[00:05] Reddit, how people lost their coins
[00:07] because basically you had to invent your
[00:09] own self-custody solution. Today, you
[00:11] can just get a hardware wallet if you're
[00:13] talking about like large sums and you
[00:15] want to keep them secure. There's a
[00:17] thing called the Glacier Protocol.
[00:19] Basically, stepby-step instructions.
[00:22] It's I think it's about 100 pages. We
[00:24] actually don't know any capital gains
[00:25] taxes, so that's that's a plus, too.
[00:28] There's a strong narrative that
[00:30] investing in Bitcoin companies is better
[00:33] than holding Bitcoin, which is obviously
[00:35] not true in my opinion. With the taxes,
[00:38] I think it's more probably just a
[00:40] bureaucracy thing because if you have to
[00:42] list every coffee purchase on your tax
[00:44] return, that just sucks. That doesn't
[00:46] make any sense because if you have
[00:48] Bitcoin on an exchange, it's it's
[00:49] basically useless. It's not not even a
[00:51] form of money. It's just like some sort
[00:53] of an investment. Everything you build
[00:56] you build in layers. There's absolutely
[00:58] no point in cramming everything into
[01:01] layer one. All that could have gone
[01:03] horribly wrong, but it didn't. It was
[01:04] like a lot of not hindsight, but really
[01:07] like thinking into the future and just
[01:09] nailing it. That's unbelievable for me.
[01:14] [Music]
[01:16] Before we get started with all the
[01:17] topics, maybe for the few people that
[01:19] don't know you, who are you? Why are you
[01:21] excited about Bitcoin?
[01:24] So, I'm Staticus, at least online. uh my
[01:27] alter ego um one of the co-founders of
[01:30] Bitbox. Um we're a Swiss hardware wallet
[01:35] company or or as I like to call us like
[01:38] an open- source company because
[01:39] everything we do is out in the open.
[01:41] It's everything is open source and we
[01:44] are a very boring unregulated nothing to
[01:48] see please move along um electronics
[01:51] manufacturer.
[01:52] So this is what we what we are building.
[01:56] We want to build freedom technology uh
[01:58] for Bitcoin for self-custody
[02:01] um trust minimized open for everybody to
[02:05] to validate on their own. Yeah. I always
[02:09] forget you're from Switzerland like the
[02:10] the Bitcoin country. Uh for for me it's
[02:13] like the the it it would be my plan B if
[02:17] Europe and the European Union gets crazy
[02:19] like Switzerland is like almost like
[02:21] Austria without the EU for me. Okay.
[02:24] Yeah. I would say Surirk the M uh the
[02:27] largest city in Switzerland is probably
[02:29] more Bitcoin focused while Zuk the
[02:31] crypto valley is more like the host of
[02:34] the Ethereum Foundation and all the
[02:36] other um altcoin stuff. But we're based
[02:40] in Zurich. So yeah, I think what it's
[02:43] worth. I think it's just cool to have uh
[02:45] in the middle of Europe, Switzerland,
[02:48] where they like I don't care what what
[02:50] they promote and not promote, but like
[02:52] at least they let innovation and Bitcoin
[02:55] happen. It's always like if you let
[02:57] innovation happen, yeah, you probably
[02:58] also attract a lot of crypto and web
[03:00] free things, but you kind of have to
[03:02] ignore that. At least Bitcoin can
[03:04] prosper in the country. And I think
[03:06] that's a that's really cool to see in
[03:07] Switzerland. Definitely. I guess low
[03:09] taxes also help especially for the
[03:11] foundations, but there's a healthy like
[03:14] free market even when it comes to taxes
[03:16] and like money and all that stuff. So I
[03:19] think it's good to see what can bring
[03:22] the most value to consumers. Yeah, I
[03:24] think most people are not aware like
[03:25] Switzerland is a pretty small country
[03:27] but in the Switzerland there's certain
[03:29] regions and they have different tax
[03:31] codes and it's it's it's it's
[03:33] fascinating to see. Yeah, Switzerland is
[03:36] very decentralized. So I think where
[03:37] Bitcoin really fits well like 26 cantons
[03:41] in for just 8 or 9 million people with
[03:44] different legislation almost like states
[03:47] in the US of course they are hu way
[03:49] bigger um different school laws
[03:53] different tax regulation and yeah it it
[03:58] keeps us fit and really limits
[04:01] government overreach. Absolutely. Yeah.
[04:04] Um but let's get started with self
[04:06] custody. Uh and and I'm always shocked
[04:07] and I told you that beforehand I'm very
[04:09] focused on self- custody. I'm only
[04:11] holding in self- custody. I'm as soon as
[04:13] I get Bitcoin in on some non-self
[04:16] custody way, which is um barely
[04:18] happening these days because I earn in
[04:20] Bitcoin. So like uh um part of uh I I
[04:23] almost don't have to to buy Bitcoin
[04:26] these days. I don't even touch the
[04:27] exchanges. Um I always try to move it
[04:30] directly to self custody or some hot
[04:32] wallet or like some kind of things that
[04:34] I I can do. Um, why do you think so many
[04:38] people aren't still in self-custody? And
[04:41] yeah, like as I said in the beginning,
[04:42] the poll that I always do it like around
[04:44] 50% of my audience is still not in self
[04:47] custody even though I'm so focused on
[04:48] it. Um, why why do you think most people
[04:51] still haven't gotten to self custody and
[04:54] how can we like move more people to that
[04:57] uh future? I think most people probably
[05:00] start out with just buying some Bitcoin
[05:03] um on an exchange and the next step of
[05:06] actually withdrawing the Bitcoin is of
[05:09] course not really promoted by exchanges.
[05:11] So it takes a while until you and like
[05:14] interest also a bit of knowledge and
[05:17] about the why you should do that. And
[05:20] for me, it's it's actually a pretty easy
[05:23] sell because once people realize um that
[05:27] Bitcoin as money has like these unique
[05:30] properties, it's a better asset. It's
[05:32] trustless. No third party risk. No, it's
[05:36] censorship resistant. Nobody can tell
[05:38] you what to do or what not to do. But
[05:41] you basically lose all these properties
[05:43] if you hold the Bitcoin on an exchange.
[05:45] then it's just like another account on a
[05:47] bank and maybe even worse because banks
[05:51] are pretty um well regulated and funded
[05:54] and most of the exchanges are more of a
[05:58] wild west style company. Not all of
[06:01] course I guess in Switzerland, Germany,
[06:03] we have also Austria we have quite
[06:05] reputable companies but if you then just
[06:09] go to like FTX
[06:12] had like a they were a Super Bowl
[06:13] sponsor. they had like huge political
[06:16] influence and still it's just like house
[06:19] of cards. So, you can get rid of all
[06:23] that uh by just holding your own coins.
[06:26] And I think it's never been easier like
[06:29] today. Um I mentioned before BitBox is
[06:32] now 10 years old, which is like for me
[06:35] personally an amazing achievement in a
[06:37] space that has changed so much. We're
[06:40] still around and going strong.
[06:44] And I think when I think back um 10
[06:48] years ago, it's like insanely
[06:50] complicated. So many soap stories on
[06:53] Reddit, how people lost their coins
[06:55] because basically you had to invent your
[06:57] own self-custody solution. Today, you
[07:00] can just get a hardware wallet. Of
[07:02] course, you should get a reputable one.
[07:04] And that's all it takes. It's really not
[07:08] that complicated.
[07:09] Do by the way do you have any data on
[07:12] how many people how many bitcoiners
[07:14] actually have self custo I guess 50% is
[07:16] probably way too high because like this
[07:18] is people that actually watch a bitcoin
[07:20] channel online. Uh I have heard I think
[07:23] like last bit uh bitcoin prag conference
[07:25] I heard someone talking about like two
[07:27] to 5% which seemed very low for me. I
[07:30] don't know what the actual data is. No I
[07:32] don't have any strong insights to be
[07:35] honest. We don't even know how many of
[07:37] our own customers keep what coins and
[07:40] how much of them of course um we are
[07:43] very privacy focused company and it's
[07:46] it's hard to guess. I I would assume
[07:49] that especially this or maybe even last
[07:51] year the overall overall volume has
[07:54] probably gone down with all the ETFs
[07:56] with all the micro strategy stuff with
[07:59] like the institutions coming in huge
[08:02] sums but I think that's only one aspect
[08:06] what I care about is that we're a B2B
[08:09] B2C company we we are producing consumer
[08:13] um products not for institutions or for
[08:16] companies And for me, this is the real
[08:18] metric, the decentralized aspect of
[08:21] spreading the coins in in the
[08:23] population. So everybody can hold their
[08:26] own coins. And I think just the number
[08:28] of individual wallets, regardless how
[08:31] how much or how little bitcoin they
[08:34] hold, I think that's probably some
[08:36] something we should uh promote. But it's
[08:40] really hard to estimate how how large
[08:42] that um percentage is. Yeah, it's true.
[08:46] It's also um I think like around 70% of
[08:49] the bitcoin are still held by
[08:50] individuals. So not only like 70% of the
[08:52] wallets but like actually the 70% of the
[08:55] volume of bitcoin uh which is is quite
[08:58] high. Um and so I I I disregard these
[09:02] days the danger of like people relying
[09:06] just on institutions and all the bitcoin
[09:09] will be just to help institutions and
[09:11] and people will just have the IOU. Um I
[09:14] I I think there is a small chance of
[09:16] that happening but right now there's no
[09:18] indication for that but maybe when we
[09:21] move more in those I I see that big
[09:24] cycle that we have now of like
[09:26] institutional adoption but retail is
[09:28] kind of sleeping still we have like a
[09:31] little bit of less retail um interest
[09:34] when you look at YouTube search volume
[09:36] when you look at Google search volume
[09:37] and you look at all the the volumes that
[09:40] you can compare to 2017 2091. Do you see
[09:43] some danger in in institutions
[09:46] really um um kind of not not taking over
[09:49] but like getting more and more of the
[09:50] market share and this the smaller small
[09:53] individual bubble kind of swapping over
[09:56] to exchanges and ETFs and whatever. Hard
[09:59] question. Um I don't have a crystal
[10:02] ball. I think there's a strong narrative
[10:05] that um investing in Bitcoin companies
[10:09] is better than holding Bitcoin, which is
[10:11] obviously not true in my opinion. Um I'm
[10:15] kind of open to that when these
[10:18] companies actually are working for
[10:19] Bitcoin. Like they are like giving back.
[10:22] they're producing something valuable
[10:24] like creating new interesting technology
[10:28] or services things like that make
[10:31] bitcoin more useful for example just in
[10:33] the US every bitcoin transaction is a
[10:36] taxable event right so it's really hard
[10:39] to spend bitcoin in a non-ilgal way so
[10:45] many bitcoiners borrow against their
[10:47] bitcoin which I think is is a valid way
[10:50] of using your bit bitcoin in stack. Um,
[10:53] but if companies just are basically just
[10:56] like money bags, I don't really find
[10:59] that too too interesting. And for me at
[11:02] the heart, as I mentioned, like Bitcoin
[11:04] and Bitbox especially, I think it's it's
[11:07] really freedom technology. And this is
[11:10] something we really need to to work to
[11:13] to keep to not like let other narratives
[11:18] like greed and yield and all that stuff
[11:21] that seems to come out of nothing to
[11:24] take over and like work against self
[11:27] custody.
[11:28] I think spending is really important
[11:30] like spending bitcoin like actually
[11:32] using the bitcoin somehow and obviously
[11:36] there the people just like they have a
[11:38] feared income they don't want to spend
[11:39] any because they have like their uh they
[11:42] just want to stack more satoshi and and
[11:44] that's that's perfectly fine um but
[11:46] there are also people that uh even when
[11:49] they want to spend something of the
[11:50] stack they borrow against it or they do
[11:52] something else with that uh and I think
[11:54] spending bitcoin is something underrated
[11:57] and I'm I'm curious on what you think
[11:59] about that. I think the taxes actually
[12:02] should not hold someone back because if
[12:05] you have a situation where you are uh
[12:07] 90% on Bitcoin and you spend the 10% of
[12:10] fiat, you can spend 10% of fiat without
[12:13] taxes obviously. If you then go ahead
[12:16] and convert those uh remaining 10% to
[12:20] 100% bitcoin, then you have to spend
[12:22] your bitcoin obviously and then you also
[12:25] uh have to pay capital gains tax when
[12:28] you make a profit. But that's the point.
[12:30] You only pay capital gains tax if you
[12:33] make profits on those 10%. So um holding
[12:38] feiat is ultimately worse because when
[12:43] you hold bitcoin you only pay something
[12:46] if you are better off than holding feiat
[12:50] for me the taxes is like it's anyways
[12:52] just if you made profit from that. So
[12:56] yeah of course it sucks that you have to
[12:57] pay taxes like I'm I'm not a friend of
[12:59] taxes. I'm very much against taxes but
[13:02] it's still better than holding fears.
[13:04] True. I I think the main So, I'm
[13:06] personally I'm a huge like spend and
[13:08] replace guy. Um I just have a standing
[13:11] order buying a bit of Bitcoin every
[13:14] month and I know I can spend it. I mean
[13:18] I don't spend like huge sums but I spend
[13:20] freely and I know sometimes over over
[13:23] the month I I'll get a bit more,
[13:25] sometimes I get get less, but it's
[13:27] always a positive amount that I add to
[13:30] my stack with spend and replace. And
[13:32] that has also become a lot easier with
[13:36] um non-custodial exchanges that send you
[13:39] the bitcoin directly to your wallet. So
[13:42] just have a standing order and then you
[13:44] can just start spending bitcoin when you
[13:47] feel like it. With the taxes, I think
[13:49] it's more probably just a bureaucracy
[13:51] thing because if you have to list every
[13:54] coffee purchase on your tax return, that
[13:56] that just sucks. That doesn't make any
[13:58] sense. And I guess nobody should do
[14:01] that. Um or should need to do that. Um
[14:06] and I really hope that some sort of like
[14:07] a minimal amount that is not taxable
[14:11] will be established in the US at some
[14:13] point. I I I hope so. I also hope that
[14:16] it it comes to Europe. Uh it's like I
[14:18] mean in in Germany, I don't know
[14:20] actually how it's in Switzerland, but in
[14:22] Germany you have the rule if you hold it
[14:25] longer than one year they are taxfree.
[14:27] In Austria, the rule is unfortunately no
[14:29] longer there. Uh, but it's all still
[14:31] there for people that bought Bitcoin.
[14:34] What is the date? February 2021. Might
[14:36] be wrong. Maybe it's February 2022,
[14:38] something like that. Um, so the Bitcoin
[14:41] you bought before that. How's it in
[14:43] Switzerland? You pay for for every uh
[14:45] transaction. No. Um, we we actually
[14:47] don't know any capital gains taxes, so
[14:49] that's that's a plus, too. Wait,
[14:51] Switzerland has no capital gains tax at
[14:53] all. We do have a wealth tax, but it's
[14:55] like 0.01. 0 1 whatever percent just
[14:58] like once per year at the end of the
[15:01] year what you owe what you own sorry um
[15:05] is taxed and that's but that has nothing
[15:08] to do if you spend or uh the bitcoin or
[15:11] not you make Switzerland uh more
[15:14] attractive already like like every time
[15:16] I talk with someone from Switzerland I'm
[15:18] like oh like I'm in the wrong
[15:20] mountain village. Yeah. But yeah, there
[15:23] there's also there are also some uh apps
[15:24] that make it easy, I guess, with the
[15:26] taxes. Um um I I personally don't use
[15:29] any of those, but I heard of of some
[15:31] interesting things where you just like
[15:32] plug in the public address and then
[15:34] they're like, "Oh, like here's what you
[15:36] owe on taxes and this is the report and
[15:39] you you can do it easily." But yeah, but
[15:42] the one thing you mentioned that like
[15:43] actually spending bitcoin or using
[15:46] bitcoin is important. I think that also
[15:48] comes down to or or leads back to self
[15:51] custody because if you have Bitcoin on
[15:53] an exchange, it's it's basically
[15:55] useless. It's not not even a form of
[15:57] money. It's just like some sort of an
[15:58] investment because nobody can pay you.
[16:01] Uh you cannot pay anyone. Um you can
[16:04] withdraw into your own wallet, but then
[16:06] again, you need a harder wallet if the
[16:08] sum is large enough. Um, it's it's
[16:12] basically just useless
[16:14] rock like shiny rock like gold without
[16:18] all the the cool stuff that Bitcoin
[16:20] offers on top of that. So self- custody
[16:23] is the only way to actually use Bitcoin
[16:25] as money. And there are even some
[16:28] exchanges that don't you where you
[16:30] cannot withdraw. I think Robin Hood and
[16:32] N26 in in Austria definitely I know. So
[16:35] there's some places where you can buy
[16:36] Bitcoin and you're trapped. Yeah. you
[16:40] have to sell it again. That's definitely
[16:41] not what it was meant to be. Absolutely.
[16:43] And when I think back like 10 years when
[16:46] the first Bitbox 01, it was called
[16:48] Digital Bitbox came to market, that was
[16:51] like a very different place obviously.
[16:53] And I know that when I I wasn't in the
[16:57] team back then, but uh that was like
[16:59] just two guys, Yonas Schnelli and our
[17:01] CEO Douglas Beckham. Um they basically
[17:05] invented a harder wallet from scratch
[17:08] basically at the same time as Treasure,
[17:10] but even before Leeder came out with
[17:12] their first device. And
[17:15] back then nobody knew what a hardware
[17:18] wallet actually should do or should
[17:20] should offer. So none of these devices
[17:23] had a screen. And of course this is also
[17:27] what led to like iterations and
[17:30] improvements in hardware. So
[17:32] self-custody really came a became a lot
[17:35] more secure and a lot a lot easier over
[17:38] the last years.
[17:41] How was that time? I'm really curious
[17:42] because like I never actually um
[17:46] researched how it was in the early days
[17:48] to self custody. I had some guests on
[17:50] that talked about how hard it was to buy
[17:52] Bitcoin even and some crazy stories
[17:54] where you had to meet some shady guy in
[17:56] some coffee shop to like get some
[17:58] Bitcoin because there was not really
[17:59] exchanges. Uh so that was that was
[18:02] interesting to hear. How was it to like
[18:04] self custody the bitcoin? We also hear a
[18:07] lot of stories of like how people lost a
[18:09] bitcoin in the in the early days. Um I
[18:12] don't have like that much um firsthand
[18:14] experience in these very olden days. But
[18:17] of course then you basically had if you
[18:19] if you're talking about like large sums
[18:22] and you want to keep them secure there's
[18:25] a thing called the glacier protocol.
[18:27] Basically stepbystep instructions. It's
[18:29] I think it's about a 100 pages that you
[18:32] you need to buy like two identical
[18:35] laptops. You need to like manually
[18:38] remove the network card, the Wi-Fi card,
[18:41] all everything is in duplicate. You it's
[18:43] like hours and hours of like gutting the
[18:47] the the laptop just to get some sort of
[18:50] a secure airgapped device. Um,
[18:55] and still it's so easy to up
[18:57] because at some point of course you
[18:59] still need to communicate with the
[19:01] outside world and air gap as it has is
[19:04] is used often as a marketing gimmick is
[19:07] basically just that. It's not really
[19:10] that much of a security benefit because
[19:12] communication still happens and if you
[19:15] use USB sticks or SD cards or all that
[19:18] stuff,
[19:21] things can leak, keys can um get outside
[19:25] of your secure enclave. And that's the
[19:28] best
[19:29] that's best practice back then. Most of
[19:32] course didn't do that and just held it
[19:34] on on a on their regular computer on or
[19:37] on their phone or on empty Gox as one of
[19:40] the mer first exchanges before it just
[19:44] went bust. So many coins were lost back
[19:47] then because there just wasn't like any
[19:51] offthe-shelf proven product that has
[19:54] been like built upon the experience of
[19:59] like actual users and standardized with
[20:02] things that you can recover in a in a
[20:05] way that is not like um invented by
[20:08] yourself. Interesting. And how has it
[20:10] been then kind of uh developed from
[20:14] there? I think uh the Bitbox came out
[20:16] like as you said 10 years ago, quite a
[20:19] long time ago. Uh and how has it been
[20:21] like developed over over the years? So
[20:24] the first Bitbox 01 um didn't have a
[20:27] screen, but it did have a a mobile app
[20:30] as a two- factor um authenticator.
[20:34] Basically, you had to check because if
[20:36] if you have a signing device like a
[20:38] hardware wallet, of course, it should
[20:40] not sign Bitcoin transactions blindly.
[20:44] This is where all the these credit card
[20:46] things already fall on their faces
[20:48] because if you cannot um check what
[20:51] you're actually signing, you're 100%
[20:53] trusting the host device, which is
[20:56] actually not not exactly the point not
[20:58] to do.
[21:01] Exactly. Nice. that brings back a lot of
[21:04] memories.
[21:07] Um and but we had a um a mobile app
[21:11] which was paired with the Bitbox uh 01
[21:14] and you can actually like check what
[21:17] you're signing on on your phone. So that
[21:20] was already quite a good security. Um
[21:25] but of course today we expect a hardware
[21:28] wallet to have a screen. It's just like
[21:30] best practice and I would never use one
[21:32] with that doesn't have a screen. So if
[21:35] you go to the exactly the Bitbox O2 of
[21:37] of course comes with a screen. It still
[21:40] has the micro SD card backup which is
[21:42] really nice because it allows you to set
[21:44] up the Bitbox in in just a few minutes
[21:47] without actually going through all the
[21:49] hassle at least in the beginning to
[21:51] write down all the recovery words. So
[21:53] you can do it with a friend without
[21:55] seeing the words or you leaving the room
[21:58] for 10 20 minutes. Of course you still
[22:01] have the option to write the recovery
[22:04] words down later and we also recommend
[22:06] that. Um but just to get started we have
[22:10] a speedrun on Twitter. We set up a bit
[22:12] box two in under one minute including
[22:14] backup and you you're you're ready to
[22:17] go. So that's that's really nice. Uh
[22:21] just a side question. What is the
[22:22] importance actually of a Bitcoin only
[22:25] addition of a hardware wallet? Is it
[22:27] just to like block out the noise of of
[22:29] the hardware wallet for for users?
[22:31] That's certainly part of it. So, um the
[22:33] Bitbox 01 was a multi- edition. It
[22:36] already supported Ethereum and other
[22:38] things. Of course, that back then there
[22:40] was not a lot else. Um but as I
[22:44] mentioned, Yunas Schnelli, one of the uh
[22:46] main Bitcoin core uh maintainers was a
[22:50] co-founder of the original uh Bitbox
[22:53] company. And for him, it was always a
[22:56] very important thing to also make a
[22:59] Bitcoin only device. And with the
[23:01] Bitboxer 2, we actually did that. And
[23:05] from what I see, we sell about 50/50.
[23:07] Although they're they're the same
[23:09] hardware, just different firmware. and
[23:11] the Bitcoin only which does less doesn't
[23:15] cost less. It's it's the same price. Um
[23:18] yet we still sell 50/50. I think most
[23:20] people buy it either because they want
[23:22] the device to be as minimal as possible,
[23:25] like less error um for um like less
[23:31] potential for error or they want to gift
[23:34] the device to someone and they want to
[23:36] make sure that they not immediately
[23:38] search for the latest meme coin to buy.
[23:42] And there's also like a more theoretical
[23:44] security benefit um because it does have
[23:47] less external dependencies on
[23:50] programming libraries or um every line
[23:53] of code has um some sort of a
[23:56] theoretical potential for a buck and if
[23:58] you have less code um that means less
[24:01] attack surface. So in theory it's a bit
[24:04] more secure. But I think we're talking
[24:06] about a security level in general that
[24:09] is so high that I would classify that
[24:12] more as statistical noise. It it it's
[24:15] super interesting because I only
[24:17] recommend Bitcoin only things to friends
[24:20] and family because I had it too often in
[24:22] the early days where I gave them uh just
[24:25] an like oh like here buy your Bitcoin
[24:27] you can use any exchange and they're
[24:28] like coming back with Bitcoin Cash like
[24:31] coming back with Ethereum. I'm like like
[24:32] that's not the thing I'm talking about.
[24:35] So I'm always recommending Bitcoin only
[24:37] things uh exchanges with without wallets
[24:40] with anything. So I think it's an
[24:41] absolute like must to have just for
[24:44] orange peeling people. Uh yeah security
[24:46] wise I'm I'm I'm not the expert but uh I
[24:49] can imagine of course I'm a software
[24:51] developer actually by trade. Uh so I
[24:53] know less code is you have more overview
[24:57] over the over the whole thing and it's
[24:59] just like every single line of code that
[25:01] you introduce can also introduce
[25:04] theoretically as we said um a faulty
[25:06] thing. So like that's that that that's
[25:08] very true. Exactly. And the cool thing
[25:11] is now then like I was I think back like
[25:14] I think 2019 we introduced the Bitbox 2
[25:18] with the screen and all the the nice
[25:20] things. Um, I mean the Bitboxer one
[25:23] already had a USB connector, um, but a
[25:26] USBA, so it was more meant for like
[25:28] desktop or laptop computers. We switched
[25:31] already in 2019 to the USBC connector
[25:35] which is like has proven very worthwhile
[25:38] because now even today now basically
[25:40] USBC has become the standard even for
[25:43] iPhones and with the mail adapt mail
[25:46] plug you don't need an adapter you don't
[25:49] need an extension cable or anything you
[25:51] just plug it into your phone into your
[25:53] tablet into your laptop and then that's
[25:56] all there is. So that's that's really
[25:58] nice. And of course the Bitbox 2 doesn't
[26:02] like it it's it's meant from a hardware
[26:04] perspective is as as simple as it gets.
[26:07] There are no moving parts. All the touch
[26:09] interface is like induction. Um there's
[26:12] no battery that can lead to a huge
[26:15] number of problems or like degrade over
[26:18] time. Um, so it's as simple as possible
[26:22] and it's just like meant to keep your
[26:26] coin safe and do nothing else. I have
[26:28] mine since since quite some time. I
[26:30] think since since 3 years and never made
[26:32] any problems like they they they meant
[26:35] to to last like things from Switzerland
[26:38] again. Definitely. And I mean even if
[26:41] you got like uh we we actually had like
[26:43] a a huge beta program like hundreds of
[26:46] devices we gave out for free just to get
[26:48] initial user feedback which led to some
[26:52] minor um improvements but nothing
[26:55] serious. For example, we swapped out the
[26:57] the micro SD card slot for a different
[27:00] thing um different model. But even if
[27:04] you had a better device or then the
[27:06] first production device from 2019,
[27:08] you're still getting updates. Today, um,
[27:12] every few months, there's no limitation.
[27:16] The hardware holds up really well and
[27:18] this will continue. There are no plans
[27:20] of like phasing the Bitboxer 2 out
[27:24] because it it it does what it needs to
[27:27] do and the hardware holds up really
[27:29] well. But of course um there are limits
[27:33] and I mentioned the iPhone for example.
[27:35] We were really happy when the iPhone
[27:37] switched to USBC but unfortunately it's
[27:41] not it's never that easy with Apple. So
[27:43] the the Bitbox O2 as we know today um is
[27:49] not iPhone compatible but this will
[27:52] change. Yeah, it's it's it's Ivan is
[27:55] always a a special player in the field
[27:58] and I have myself iPhone but it's it's
[28:02] always interesting when you want to do
[28:04] something with with those things and I
[28:06] think this is what I wanted to lead
[28:08] towards to that um after like 6 years
[28:11] there have been some hardware like
[28:15] requirements that we always wanted to do
[28:18] and that are not possible in software
[28:21] for example the bitbox box O2 is it is
[28:24] made out of plastic um by design um and
[28:28] it's slightly translucent so that the
[28:30] screen can show through but of course
[28:31] plastic also means that it can scratch
[28:34] especially if you have just have it in
[28:36] your backpack or whatever. So a glass
[28:39] top or a glass uh screen with tempered
[28:42] glass has always been something we
[28:43] wanted to do. Of course, the the iPhone
[28:47] compatibility is like the feature
[28:50] request number one. And this is why I'm
[28:53] very happy to say that as of basically
[28:56] today, we'll have the next version of
[28:59] the Bitbox 2. It's not the Bitbox 03.
[29:02] It's um like an improvement, but not a
[29:06] completely new device. Um but we call it
[29:09] the Bitbox 2 Nova. and it comes with
[29:12] some additional hardware features and if
[29:16] you want I would be very happy to talk
[29:18] about that. Yeah, absolutely. Uh do
[29:20] maybe also you you probably have some
[29:22] some pictures that you can show us and
[29:24] then um I yeah I don't have maybe you
[29:26] have some pictures I didn't prepare but
[29:28] I actually have a proper device that
[29:30] that's even better. That's probably even
[29:32] better. So you see that it's actually
[29:35] Oh, I'm not not a not an influencer. you
[29:37] see like the autofocus, but so the the
[29:40] glass top is really nice. But otherwise,
[29:42] it's still like the same discrete
[29:44] device. You don't even see that it's
[29:46] like something special really, but it
[29:49] comes like with a very nice matte
[29:51] finish, the glass top, and now you can
[29:54] just plug it into your iPhone or into
[29:56] the iPad and
[29:59] use it basically now on any device that
[30:03] you have that can run apps.
[30:05] So like it's now compatible with with
[30:08] iPhone. Uh uh what else did change with
[30:11] that one? Sorry, I didn't I didn't
[30:13] understand. Just like um so like it's
[30:15] now compatible with the iPhone. Is there
[30:17] something else that changed with this
[30:19] device? Yeah. So as I mentioned, the
[30:22] glass top is really nice. Um we will
[30:26] also offer additional colors. For
[30:28] example, there's from the start a white
[30:30] version as well for people that want to
[30:33] have more of a sleek um design um or
[30:37] have multiple and want to keep them
[30:39] apart. Um we also updated the like the
[30:43] security slightly. So it it now features
[30:46] a fully certified um EA6 plus um
[30:50] security chip. So that's more of a
[30:53] security guarantee. Um, but it it's
[30:56] really more of an overhaul. But I think
[30:59] just the the the
[31:02] feature that you now can basically use
[31:04] it with any device, even iPhones and
[31:06] iPads um is is a huge step forward
[31:10] because so many people um um are
[31:13] basically using iPads now for their
[31:16] daily driver and the software we build
[31:20] really is mobile first. So that's I
[31:23] think um comes now to a finally to a
[31:26] good conclusion now that we can also
[31:28] support the iPhone and iPad. Oh, so like
[31:31] you even built it for being mobile first
[31:35] instead of uh being first on on desktop.
[31:39] I mean we the the Bitbox app that we of
[31:42] course is free. You can download it and
[31:44] you should download it to start uh get
[31:47] started and initialize the Bitbox. It is
[31:50] built with um eurosoft developer. It has
[31:53] a um I think a go back end and a react
[31:58] native uh front end. So we can basically
[32:01] compile it to any platform that we want.
[32:04] And of course it supports Windows, it
[32:07] supports Mac OS for a long time. That's
[32:10] not something that was restricted. Um it
[32:13] supports all variants of Linux. Um it
[32:16] has been supported by for Android for a
[32:19] long time which that because that this
[32:21] is more of an open platform and many
[32:24] people actually prefer to use the Bitbox
[32:27] on their phone or I like Android tablet
[32:30] because of course that comes with a
[32:32] touch interface and it's really nice and
[32:35] easy to use. Um, and now of course we
[32:39] can also like compile it for iPhone and
[32:42] iPads and now that it actually can
[32:45] communicate with the with these devices.
[32:48] Interesting. But by the way, fun fact, I
[32:51] was actually go and react. Uh, okay. So
[32:55] I had to go and uh react in JavaScript
[32:58] kind of a and TypeScript uh experience
[33:01] in my past, but it's it's a long time
[33:04] coming. So next time you have a feature
[33:07] request, I'll just ask for your pull
[33:09] request.
[33:10] I can program it myself. Yeah. No, but
[33:13] that would be probably a security risk
[33:16] for me.
[33:18] This is actually a good thing because we
[33:20] we do from time to time um accept
[33:22] external contributions but it's really
[33:24] hard and the bar is really high because
[33:27] of course you kind of trust not the
[33:30] software itself but the process and that
[33:33] people are actually looking at the code.
[33:36] Um everything is in the open but of
[33:39] course with every update there are
[33:40] changes and for us it's really
[33:43] important. You can basically check every
[33:46] pull request, every code change,
[33:48] including all the discussions that
[33:50] happen that people peer review each
[33:53] other's contributions also from our
[33:56] internal developers. Um, it's it's
[33:59] really really important that the code
[34:01] quality is very high so that it's easy
[34:03] to audit and to be honest, I wouldn't
[34:06] want to go through our hiring process as
[34:08] an engineer.
[34:11] Um, yeah, that's that's that's something
[34:13] else. And then also if you contribute
[34:15] code and you get criticized and there's
[34:18] like so much stuff you need to change to
[34:20] just like get into the flow of what
[34:23] level of code um quality is expected.
[34:26] That's really something I'm I'm I'm
[34:28] quite proud of although I'm not directly
[34:30] involved but it's it's out in the open.
[34:32] Everybody can can look at how we work. I
[34:34] never looked at that aspect if you're a
[34:36] software developer because uh when I
[34:38] developed software it was all closed
[34:40] source. it was not open sourced. Um, so
[34:43] you're only judged by your direct
[34:45] manager or by the CTO or like someone
[34:48] above you and maybe by some colleagues
[34:50] that say like, oh, like you could
[34:51] improve this and that. But if you open
[34:53] source as an as an internal uh
[34:55] developer, you're judged by the whole
[34:57] world basically. Definitely. The first
[34:59] time I ever made any money, I got myself
[35:02] from that money a watch. And ever since
[35:04] then, I collect time pieces to remember
[35:07] times where I achieved some milestone.
[35:10] That's why I got the Bitcoin 2025
[35:12] edition when I went to my first ever
[35:15] American Bitcoin conference. So for me,
[35:17] the Bitcoin watches from Coin Vigilant
[35:20] represents the time that we are living
[35:22] in. For every person that wears a
[35:24] Bitcoin watch, I know they are
[35:27] representing sound money to the outside
[35:30] world. Make sure to check out those
[35:32] amazing Coin Vigilante time pieces down
[35:35] in the descriptions. I love those
[35:37] watches so so much. I know how big of a
[35:41] hurdle it can be to have self-custody,
[35:44] but it's so freaking important to make
[35:46] that first step. We have to make sure
[35:49] it's as easy and simple as possible. And
[35:53] that's exactly what Bitbox did. Bitbox
[35:55] created the simplest and the easiest
[35:58] hard wallet to use to get into self
[36:01] custody. So get yourself a Bitbox down
[36:04] from the link in the description. And
[36:06] when you use code Robin, you even get a
[36:08] 5% discount. Most people realize that
[36:12] way, way, way too late. If you have
[36:15] Bitcoin, you have to have a self-custody
[36:18] hardware wallet. But what are you doing
[36:19] if that hardware wallet breaks? Yeah,
[36:21] you wrote your seed phrase on paper.
[36:24] What if that paper is just dissolving or
[36:27] water spilled on top of it? Paper is
[36:30] very, very nondurable. So you have to
[36:33] have a fire resistant, water resistant,
[36:36] and impact proof method of securing your
[36:39] seat phrase so you can back up your
[36:41] keys. And to do that, you should use a
[36:44] solid titanium plate from stamp seed. Go
[36:47] to stampseed.com
[36:49] and use code robin to get not five or
[36:53] 10, but 15% off your stamp seed. The
[36:58] most important thing for your Bitcoin
[37:01] journey is not buying Bitcoin, but it's
[37:03] how to keep them. And yes, you have
[37:05] maybe the right tools, but how do you
[37:07] actually go ahead and stick it all
[37:09] together so it's the most secure for you
[37:12] personally? Self-custody is a deeply
[37:15] personalized journey and the Bitcoin way
[37:17] is helping you exactly finding that
[37:20] correct setup for you personally.
[37:23] They're also helping you with securing
[37:25] your own cyber security. And if you want
[37:28] to go one step above all that, you can
[37:31] even get a consultation for a plan B
[37:35] residency. Go to the bitcoinway.com/roin
[37:40] and you will get a 30 minute free
[37:42] consultation. It's an interesting
[37:45] aspect. How important is that? like have
[37:47] you seen where like um uh people from
[37:50] the outside catched something and open
[37:52] source really was giving very valuable
[37:55] feedback for for bits. Definitely um we
[37:59] do have a buck bounty program. So if
[38:03] that's the whole point of open source,
[38:05] right? So it closed source might be
[38:09] let's say more efficient or easier in
[38:11] the short term. Um, but if you're open
[38:14] source in the mid or long term, I I I
[38:17] would I would just claim that it's
[38:19] always going to result in higher quality
[38:22] code and less uh more secure code
[38:24] because it's not only the audits that
[38:27] you commission yourself from a
[38:29] professional company, which we did as
[38:32] well. We actually had two independent
[38:34] professional audits for the Bitbox O2.
[38:38] But these are more like checking all the
[38:40] boxes audits or going through best
[38:43] practices when it comes to coding. But
[38:46] with Bitcoin security, most of the
[38:49] vulnerabilities are really thinking
[38:51] outside the box vulnerabilities like the
[38:54] hardware wallet not enforcing
[38:57] um some sort of a logical check or um
[39:02] just not understanding the protocol of
[39:05] Bitbox enough. And with the buck bounty
[39:08] program and us being fully 100% open
[39:12] source, we encourage independent um um
[39:17] security professionals to look at our
[39:19] code and if they find something of
[39:21] course they should report it to our to
[39:24] us first so that we can fix it which has
[39:26] happened in the past. nothing critical
[39:28] but some things have been improved and
[39:32] that's a wellestablished process that
[39:35] they report it to us in an encrypted
[39:37] form. Um we evaluate the vulnerability.
[39:42] Um we basically pay them um for their
[39:46] efforts and for the severity of the
[39:48] vulnerability.
[39:49] Um and then we have 90 days to fix um
[39:53] the code, release an update and after
[39:56] that the um the security researcher is
[39:59] free to do whatever that they want to.
[40:01] So there's no NDA, there's no gag order
[40:05] or anything. They can write the blog
[40:07] pass post about it and be as loud as
[40:09] they want. But for fairness sake and for
[40:13] the security of our users, usually it's
[40:16] 90 days that we have time before the
[40:19] vulnerability is is publicly disclosed.
[40:22] Makes sense. Yeah. You you don't want to
[40:25] like post that publicly as as much. And
[40:28] it's it's something that I came to know
[40:30] because I worked in IT security before.
[40:32] Um back bounty programs are something
[40:35] that is super super super really really
[40:38] good. I've seen it firsthand because I I
[40:41] personally have never done it. I have
[40:43] some really good friends back in the day
[40:44] in Munich uh that were part of buck
[40:48] bounty programs and they just like all
[40:50] the buck bounty programs that are open
[40:51] and interesting enough for them. they
[40:53] just did and uh they bought like the
[40:56] products. I can I can remember uh
[40:59] Danielle, shout out to Danielle, he was
[41:02] um having the middle classes, the
[41:04] Facebook classes and he found um bucks
[41:07] there where you can basically interject
[41:10] the video and can get it into the Wi-Fi
[41:12] because it has like an own small Wi-Fi
[41:14] and he hacked into this Wi-Fi got like a
[41:16] few thousand for finding that um bug for
[41:20] from Facebook. So backbounded programs I
[41:22] think like really interesting especially
[41:24] with hardware devices because I know
[41:26] there are a lot of um even non-
[41:29] bitcoiners out there that would just
[41:31] like to hack hardware and like to hack
[41:33] the software and the inter intersection
[41:35] with that and it's a great way of
[41:38] incentivizing
[41:39] and white labeling hackers like if if
[41:42] you don't have back boundary programs
[41:44] you incentivize hackers to be malicious.
[41:47] If you have buck bounty programs, you
[41:49] incentivize hackers to be good actors.
[41:52] So, we all I'm all about in aligning
[41:54] incentives. Uh Bitcoin is all about
[41:57] aligning in incentives. So, I I love bug
[41:59] bounty programs and uh it's it's almost
[42:01] a red flag if a company doesn't offer
[42:03] that in some some some regard. Yeah, I
[42:06] agree. And I think it's um sometimes I
[42:09] was it's it's really interesting that
[42:11] for example during some months like our
[42:15] employee of the months was basically a
[42:17] 16year-old like from France. It was like
[42:21] it's crazy that he found stuff that all
[42:24] the professionals just overlooked
[42:26] including ourselves. Nothing serious but
[42:29] um still like security is a process and
[42:33] you need to constantly improve otherwise
[42:36] at some point people will find something
[42:39] that can even in the most complex way um
[42:43] like exploit
[42:45] and we also do security um responsible
[42:48] disclosures as these are called like
[42:51] between companies. So we made this to
[42:53] all to all our competitors. We made
[42:55] responsible disclosures and have been
[42:57] paid for it and vice versa. So even in
[43:00] the professional Bitcoin security
[43:03] industry, that's a good way to
[43:06] collaborate without giving others like a
[43:09] like an unfair advantage or do stuff for
[43:11] free. Um but still like everybody is
[43:14] working towards the same goal which is
[43:16] self- sovereign, sovereignty and self-
[43:19] custody. So, if these goals align, I
[43:22] think it's a no-brainer that we also all
[43:25] act as good actors in the space and
[43:27] report security vulnerabilities to
[43:30] competitors.
[43:31] Yeah, that's something I've definitely
[43:33] learned in the IT security space.
[43:36] Security is a moving target. Definitely.
[43:39] Like you you you never fully catch up,
[43:41] but you want to be as close as possible.
[43:43] Yes.
[43:44] And it's all about like um making it as
[43:48] so when somebody claims something is
[43:51] unhackable either they don't know what
[43:53] they're talking about or they're are not
[43:56] honest with you or or are malicious.
[43:58] Like I think there are only these three
[44:00] options. Uh because everything is
[44:03] hackable eventually if you have
[44:05] unlimited resources un unlimited tries.
[44:09] So what we with hardware wallet um
[44:12] hardware security are are doing is to
[44:15] make an attack as expensive as possible
[44:18] with the least um um probability of
[44:21] success. So if you need to invest like
[44:24] 10 million into an electronics lab to
[44:27] hack something and by doing so you have
[44:30] a 99%
[44:32] um chance of destroying the device and
[44:34] make it basically break it and make it
[44:36] unusable. then that's already quite a
[44:39] good um baseline I would say. And then
[44:43] of course with the Bitbox O2 there are
[44:45] not even all the secrets are on the
[44:47] device itself. So for example the user
[44:50] password is not stored. So even if you
[44:52] could theoretically extract some data
[44:55] from it, you still need to brute force
[44:58] it afterwards. So there's so many um
[45:01] lines of defense um also with a lifetime
[45:04] counter and and whatnot that we we call
[45:07] this security in death. It's like a
[45:10] military term that if you um overrun the
[45:13] enemy with in one line there's still
[45:14] like three more lines that can take you
[45:16] out. Um so this is our strategy not
[45:21] claiming that the bitbox is unhackable.
[45:23] It's just like really really good. It's
[45:26] also interesting um with with Bitcoin
[45:29] itself um because of course you could
[45:32] theoretically hack the network but the
[45:36] resources needed are impossible to
[45:38] gather.
[45:40] Okay. If if if from like if if I
[45:42] understood that correct uh from my p
[45:45] perspective, but it's like yeah, of
[45:47] course that like a 51% attack
[45:49] theoretically, yes, it's all possible.
[45:52] It's so unrealistic, so improbable that
[45:56] it's um probably the most unhackable
[45:59] thing on earth. And uh that's what I
[46:03] always uh say to people because I get
[46:05] the question a lot especially from like
[46:07] older people that say oh but like those
[46:09] softs always have bucks and and then
[46:11] like they get hacked and like how is
[46:12] this with Bitcoin? Can someone just like
[46:14] take my money? Uh and always tell them
[46:17] first of all it's way more likely that
[46:19] you get hacked from your bank account.
[46:21] It's like way more unsecure. Uh, and
[46:25] second of all, like if you actually look
[46:26] deep, it's so hard to do it that you can
[46:31] realistically say it's impossible. But
[46:34] of course, there's always a black swan.
[46:35] There's always like a
[46:38] minor event that could theoretically
[46:41] happen potentially. Yeah. But on the
[46:43] other hand, Bitbox in itself has also
[46:46] probably the biggest buck bounty of the
[46:48] world built in because if you hack
[46:50] Bitcoin, uh you basically have unlimited
[46:53] access to so much money. So that it's
[46:56] really worthwhile and it has been battle
[46:58] tested for like 16 years now and nobody
[47:02] managed to break it. So it even with all
[47:05] the odds and resources that you can
[47:08] throw at it and and the theoretical
[47:10] potential that um things could happen um
[47:15] I'm not sure about cryptography if if
[47:17] it's even theoretically possible but at
[47:19] least with the 51% attack or something
[47:22] like that which of course is not like
[47:24] really hacking. It's more like roll
[47:26] rewriting history and maybe doing some
[47:28] double spending but they still cannot
[47:30] take your coins. Um but even that um
[47:33] it's just not feasible because if it
[47:36] would be uh somebody would have done it.
[47:39] It's kind of magical for me like h how
[47:42] did this how did this happen? Like h how
[47:44] did everything come together so
[47:46] perfectly that we don't know the origin
[47:49] that we have this secure protocol that
[47:52] was in the beginning still fragile like
[47:55] probably someone could have killed it in
[47:56] 2010 but no longer in 205. So, how did
[48:00] this slowly organically grow? It's it's
[48:02] it's really magic. Also, the best
[48:05] perfect time for that where we have so
[48:07] much fiat history already and know that
[48:10] fear is so so bad and that we really
[48:11] need an alternative. Uh but it's also
[48:14] not too late that we're already super
[48:15] deep into CBDC or anything like that.
[48:17] It's I it's magical for me like Bitcoin
[48:21] as the answer to the great financial
[48:23] crisis like as a digital version of
[48:25] Occupy Wall Street. I think that's I'm
[48:28] still surprised that not more activists
[48:30] are enthusiastic about Bitcoin because
[48:32] for me it's really uh a freedom
[48:35] technology and how the incentives that
[48:38] Satoshi built into the system still hold
[48:42] up like the haling it started with 50
[48:44] Bitcoin every 10 minutes it haled every
[48:47] four years and that kind of aligned very
[48:50] nicely with the growth of the network
[48:52] with the value it accrewed with the
[48:54] profit profitability of the minor
[48:57] etc. All that could have gone horribly
[49:00] wrong, but it didn't. It was like a lot
[49:02] of um not hindsight, but really like
[49:05] thinking into the future um and just
[49:08] nailing it. That's unbelievable for me.
[49:12] I know why there are no activists
[49:13] because uh you're getting the activists
[49:17] are busy orange pilling their loved
[49:18] ones. It's like like yeah, of course,
[49:21] you could go now to the street. is like,
[49:22] "Oh, we need Bitcoin as a" But you can
[49:25] just uh go ahead and and orange pill
[49:27] your loved ones and orange pill your
[49:29] politicians, orange pill. I think
[49:31] Bitcoin is inherently understand if you
[49:33] want to see a change in this world, like
[49:35] first of all be the change yourself and
[49:37] then like try to to change your
[49:39] environment, try to change like your
[49:41] your loved ones and and explain to you
[49:43] do to the to them why Bitcoin and also
[49:46] the game theory aspect. I think once you
[49:48] get really into Bitcoin, you're like,
[49:50] "Oh, like yeah, that's it's inevitable."
[49:52] And when you see other activists like
[49:54] for climate change or stuff like that,
[49:56] that's not inevitable. Like you kind of
[49:58] have to fight for that. So it's it's I
[50:02] think that's the inherent reason because
[50:04] I ask myself the question a lot is like,
[50:05] oh, like it makes so much sense why I am
[50:08] not on the street. Like I'm young. I
[50:10] could be on the street. I can clue I
[50:13] could clue myself on the street for
[50:14] Bitcoin. I don't know what that then
[50:16] would do for for Bitcoin but probably
[50:18] nothing. Uh why do I don't do it? Yeah,
[50:20] because I first orange built my loved
[50:22] ones and then everyone was kind of like
[50:24] either already on Bitcoin or sick of me.
[50:27] So I went to the online world went on on
[50:29] Twitter then Twitter uh blog then I made
[50:32] a podcast and podcast blog and like yeah
[50:34] I found other outlets and they are way
[50:36] more efficient in doing the same thing
[50:38] as an activist trying to do. So I think
[50:41] that's the the short answer to why there
[50:43] are no activists. Interesting. Nicely
[50:46] put. I mean there is there's one German
[50:49] guy um do you know him that sits it's
[50:54] yeah that that silently sits in front of
[50:56] the central banks and just like stands
[50:58] there with signs.
[51:00] An activist definitely.
[51:03] Um one thing uh more that I want to ask
[51:05] you if you've seen how long are you with
[51:08] with Bitbox and with the self custody
[51:10] space already like how many years? uh
[51:13] six seven years I would say hard to say
[51:17] then it's it's really great because six
[51:18] let's say let's say five years like from
[51:20] 20120 to 2025 what have you seen in in
[51:25] innovation in in technical breakthroughs
[51:27] that we have done in the self- custody
[51:29] space that are really important for uh e
[51:33] either making it more secure making more
[51:36] adoption uh possible making more user
[51:38] friendly whatever whatever direction you
[51:40] want to go with
[51:42] I mean for me um with Bitcoin as self
[51:45] sovereign um self- sovereignty there are
[51:48] many aspects harder wallets like secure
[51:51] self custody is definitely one of the
[51:54] important ones here I think things just
[51:58] got easier um products got better they
[52:03] some products also got got way more
[52:06] complicated because of all the
[52:07] shenanigans and altcoins and crypto
[52:10] swaps and like advertising and a lot of
[52:13] money going into the space. This is
[52:15] really what we try to to avoid like
[52:18] build a a minimal
[52:21] uh product basically the easiest
[52:23] hardware wallet on the market. This is
[52:25] what this is the second goal after being
[52:28] secure. But I would say most reputable
[52:32] hardware wallets are secure. So that's
[52:33] not really a USB but we want to be after
[52:36] that we want to be the easiest because I
[52:39] think secure ease of use is part of
[52:42] security. Um if you are not doing uh
[52:46] mistakes that's also part of security.
[52:50] Um other than that I think um the
[52:53] awareness how to run your own full node
[52:56] has also um grown a lot. I I I pride
[53:01] myself in being one of u the drivers
[53:04] there at least in the beginning with my
[53:06] own raspby bolt guide. Um basically the
[53:09] the the first guide that um explained
[53:12] how you run uh Bitcoin core electrome
[53:16] block explorer all that stuff on a on a
[53:18] Raspberry Pi. Um so that was very
[53:21] exciting and that was also basically my
[53:23] first time being public in the Bitcoin
[53:27] space. I think that was about 2016 2017
[53:31] especially with the block size wars I
[53:33] become that basically radicalized me
[53:35] towards Bitcoin full nodes
[53:38] and now what I think is
[53:41] changing a lot is mining um home mining
[53:46] people want to be part of the mining
[53:48] industry as well um and I think that
[53:50] becomes more feasible because um miners
[53:54] are longerlasting you don't need to
[53:57] change them every year because they
[53:59] become obsolete so so quickly. And there
[54:02] are new solutions that are actually
[54:05] using the the excess heat for for
[54:08] heating for like different things that
[54:12] so it's not only about mining. You can
[54:14] actually use mining as one
[54:19] as one block in larger solutions and
[54:21] that of course makes it a bit more
[54:24] profitable if you don't have access to
[54:26] the most to the cheapest form of
[54:28] electricity especially in Germany,
[54:30] Switzerland where we don't really have
[54:33] these like super uh um like untapped um
[54:39] energy sources like hydro that is not
[54:42] used and stuff like that yeah this this
[54:45] mining is fascinating. Mining was not on
[54:47] my radar at all till like November and
[54:49] then more more guests mentioned it and
[54:52] like all the things with the Bitex with
[54:54] the solo mining with Ocean with the
[54:56] mining templates what's going on. And
[54:58] it's it's super cool what what what uh
[55:01] the Bitcoin community uh is is doing
[55:04] because I do think um if we have just
[55:07] like two free big pools that control
[55:09] everything that could run into problems
[55:11] with like sensoring transactions and
[55:13] stuff like that. I don't think so but it
[55:15] could. So I think it's very important
[55:17] that we have ocean that we have solo
[55:19] mining that we have bites and that we
[55:21] have how does popet call it? rabbits, I
[55:24] think, on horses that we have like
[55:25] smaller uh miners that do it like with
[55:28] like maybe two three rigs at home. Uh or
[55:31] maybe like have horses that have like
[55:32] one container uh that they're running
[55:35] which is kind of movable and and like
[55:38] you you can probably clean it out in one
[55:40] day if you really want to and move it to
[55:42] a different location. So I think that's
[55:43] it's very important for for the Bitcoin
[55:45] decentralization because as we said with
[55:47] security there's no 100%
[55:49] decentralization. there's always an
[55:51] aspect that you could theoretically
[55:53] attack and the more we move towards
[55:56] decentralization the the more
[55:58] decentralized and the more secure we
[56:00] make Bitcoin the better it is like the
[56:02] the better future proof it is yeah and I
[56:04] mean I'm a an IT engineer by trade um
[56:08] not the most technical one especially in
[56:10] our company but I have a decent
[56:13] understanding of IT and security things
[56:16] um and for me it was like very obvious
[56:19] as I mentioned the block size wars in in
[56:21] in in information technology, everything
[56:24] you build you build in layers. It's
[56:27] there's absolutely no point in cramming
[56:30] everything into layer one because at
[56:32] some point the layer one will break and
[56:34] then you're basically done. So that's
[56:37] like the end of the road. But this is uh
[56:40] coming back to the the the full node
[56:42] stuff. Of course, in that context also,
[56:45] Lightning became um a lot bigger and for
[56:48] me that's also quite an important um
[56:52] aspect of actually making Bitcoin more
[56:56] usable um for everyday purchases. And
[57:00] I'm very excited about that as well. for
[57:03] example, with Bitbox, of course, we we
[57:05] always accepted bit Bitcoin payments
[57:09] um in our own web shop, but I think we
[57:12] were definitely the first and for quite
[57:15] a while the only hardware wallet
[57:18] manufacturer that sold their products
[57:20] for Lightning and it's just the best
[57:24] experience. We were, for example, a few
[57:26] years back in Bitcoin 2023 or something
[57:30] in Miami. And for us as a Swiss company,
[57:33] it's super complicated to actually sell
[57:36] products outside of of Switzerland.
[57:39] Legally, we're not allowed to take
[57:41] credit card payments. Like cash is super
[57:43] cumbersome, especially if you need to
[57:45] take them home by by plane or whatever.
[57:48] Um, Bitcoin of course is is awesome, but
[57:51] if if you do physical transactions like
[57:54] handing out the device, you
[57:55] theoretically would need to wait for for
[57:58] the at least for the first block
[58:00] confirmation to avoid like
[58:04] double spending or some like um
[58:07] rerouting of the payment. And with with
[58:10] lightning that was all these problems
[58:12] basically have fixed. It's like Bitcoin
[58:16] Lightning with a proper point of sale
[58:18] device that even prints a receipt and
[58:20] everything. It's just like the most easy
[58:23] way of traveling around the world and
[58:26] selling stuff and you just connect to
[58:28] your own server. It goes automatically
[58:31] into your accounting. And for me, that's
[58:34] also like one a huge step forward in
[58:37] Bitcoin sovereignty stack. Yeah,
[58:39] Lightning is Lightning is awesome. We
[58:41] also have an integration with with with
[58:43] the book box books. Uh it's it's it's
[58:44] it's really cool to to see the
[58:48] to see lightning work on scale because
[58:51] as I said I I'm once uh once a month I
[58:55] try and I fail most of the months but I
[58:58] try to go to the Bitcoin meetups in in
[59:00] in in Vienna and they always pay for my
[59:03] burger for my salad with with lightning
[59:06] and it it works really really cool. It's
[59:08] just it's just great to have like your
[59:10] phone lightning bump bang and then you
[59:12] have it and it's it's really nice.
[59:15] Definitely. Yeah. For me that so that's
[59:17] a bit the the Bitcoin freedom stack like
[59:20] onchain transaction validation like self
[59:24] custody like payments and then of course
[59:27] mining. I think these four aspects are
[59:29] really important. I have one question
[59:31] that I asked uh every single guest of
[59:33] mine and the question is what can we
[59:34] learn from you besides Bitcoin? Oo. Um,
[59:37] I guess if you follow my Twitter, you
[59:40] see from time to time some nice pictures
[59:42] from Swiss from the Swiss Alps. Um, I
[59:45] never post pictures about like from
[59:48] people or my family, but of course they
[59:50] are a huge part of my life. So like
[59:54] being your own boss and enjoying life
[59:58] with the freedom that maybe Bitcoin
[60:00] gives you, I think is is the most
[60:02] important aspect of being in Bitcoin. I
[60:05] see here. Yes. Nice. The Alps.
[60:09] Exactly.
[60:10] I was actually cleaning meadows for two
[60:13] days and even repairing a digger. That
[60:18] was fun thing. That's fun. Really cool.
[60:21] Um we have Yeah, we have go outside and
[60:23] touch grass. I think if you were asking
[60:25] for a for one for a one line, go outside
[60:29] and touch guys. Very very bitcoin thing
[60:30] to say. Yeah. Um, we have entertained in
[60:32] the podcast where the previous guest is
[60:34] asking a question for the next guest
[60:35] without knowing who the next guest
[60:36] actually is. And the previous guest asks
[60:38] you the question and almost impossible
[60:41] to answer question in my opinion. What
[60:43] is the single most important educational
[60:46] resource that lit up your orange brain
[60:48] cells? That's actually a very easy thing
[60:51] to answer. I think it's a it's a person
[60:53] and for me it was Andreas Antonopoulos.
[60:56] Um, I learned a lot from him from his
[60:59] ability to take a complicated question
[61:03] just from directly from the audience and
[61:06] build a 10-minute explanation that is in
[61:11] incredibly coherent
[61:13] takes you on a journey but circles back
[61:15] to the original question. I think he's
[61:18] unmatched in that regard and I I'm
[61:21] really thankful and happy to have met
[61:24] him and he really also cut my altcoin
[61:27] face very very short. That's that that's
[61:31] I think that's the single most important
[61:33] things that Bitcoin educators can do.
[61:35] Cutting the altcoin phase of of Bitcoin
[61:38] because we all kind of have it. I mean I
[61:40] see it less and less honestly. I I
[61:42] talked with I just mentioned it. was in
[61:44] Vegas at the Bitcoin conference and
[61:45] there were like
[61:47] a bunch of people that came in to me and
[61:50] they were actually orange build the last
[61:52] one and a half years in 204 or 205 and
[61:55] they actually never touched alcoins. So
[61:57] like I think maybe we're getting to a
[62:01] point where education is so broad and
[62:03] and and so good and so many different
[62:05] formats that people get it once they get
[62:08] to Bitcoin content. They don't have to
[62:10] do the altcoin thing. And also um I
[62:15] don't know if it's good or bad, but we
[62:16] now have uh another distraction in
[62:19] Bitcoin. We have those Bitcoin treasury
[62:21] companies. They kind of provide a better
[62:24] performance like get more Bitcoin. I am
[62:26] not a big fan of it. Um and this is
[62:29] coming from someone like I interviewed
[62:31] Michael Sailor. I I was at this 100K
[62:33] party and I still have never owned a
[62:36] single share of my strategy. So I I I I
[62:40] could have done it easily, but like I
[62:42] never owned it. Um uh I fully support
[62:45] what he's doing. I think he's doing a
[62:46] great service to the Bitcoin community
[62:48] in in in his way and for
[62:51] um companies, but I just don't like the
[62:53] distraction of of holding self-custody
[62:56] bitcoin. And he himself says like get
[62:58] bitcoin like he sells micro strategy
[63:00] shares and buys bitcoin and then people
[63:03] are like oh like Michael I like him
[63:04] that's why I buy micro strategy you know
[63:06] like if you follow his advice he says
[63:07] buy bitcoin and uh the point I was
[63:10] making is like I see more and more
[63:11] people that are focused on number
[63:13] technology actually going away from
[63:16] altcoins and moving towards um ius of
[63:19] bitcoin like strategy and other other
[63:22] products and this is really interesting
[63:25] uh to to see and I think it's a positive
[63:28] development where they come from
[63:30] altcoins at least to the Bitcoin
[63:32] ecosystem and it all trickles down
[63:34] anyways at some point to the Bitcoin
[63:36] main protocol so we all uh benefit from
[63:39] that. Yeah, let's hope we don't lose
[63:42] them and eventually they end up at least
[63:45] in some sort of like
[63:48] sovereign Bitcoin um ecosystem. Not
[63:53] every everybody needs to hold 100% of
[63:55] their Bitcoin themselves, but I think
[63:58] everybody should have some. And if you
[64:00] can and you if you're if you want to,
[64:02] you should have the ability to to be
[64:04] 100% in Bitcoin, especially now with
[64:07] CDBC's uh just around the corner with
[64:11] for me this is like the overarching goal
[64:13] of also why I am so excited about
[64:15] Bitcoin. I think once these like central
[64:18] bank digital currencies really become a
[64:21] reality and will be rolled out in force
[64:24] and there will be a huge um proh
[64:27] propaganda and fdding Bitcoin and all
[64:30] that stuff. I I want Bitcoin to be ready
[64:32] to be like the opt out coin for
[64:36] everybody to to have. Really cool. I
[64:38] think that's a perfect way to to end the
[64:40] podcast. So thank you so much Styos for
[64:42] for being on. Um before I let you go,
[64:45] where can people find you, ask your
[64:46] questions? I think Twitter we already
[64:47] show this. Is this the best way to reach
[64:49] out to you? Definitely Staticus 3000 um
[64:53] on Twitter. And of course for the
[64:55] Bitbox, it's bitbox. Swiss is our
[64:58] website. We have like all the
[65:00] information about our products online, a
[65:02] great blog post where we post about
[65:05] security relevant things, not only about
[65:07] Bitbox. Um it's definitely worth a read.
[65:11] And yeah um if you see us any um time at
[65:15] a conference be it a bitcoin conference
[65:17] or a fiat conference which we are more
[65:19] and more going towards to to also like
