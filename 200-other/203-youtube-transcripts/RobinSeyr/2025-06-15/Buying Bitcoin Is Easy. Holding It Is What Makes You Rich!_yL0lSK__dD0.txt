[00:00] And that's so bullish for Bitcoin
[00:01] because imagine once those great minds
[00:04] understand what's happening here.
[00:05] They're going to think of things that we
[00:06] could never dream of. People are going
[00:08] to back test and run into how much
[00:09] Bitcoin was that and they're never going
[00:11] to be able to make that Bitcoin back. So
[00:12] when they could have just bought the
[00:13] Bitcoin and been fine, right? So people
[00:15] that are raising hundreds of millions of
[00:16] dollars, billions of dollars will look
[00:17] that as negative in the future because
[00:19] like well did you return that amount of
[00:20] Bitcoin? So it kind of flips that.
[00:21] You're kind of fiat mining, right?
[00:23] You're making a nice balance. You may
[00:24] even have fiat obligations because of
[00:26] your student debt or the, you know, the
[00:28] wife's now staying at home and multiple
[00:30] kids, but the Bitcoin wealth has
[00:32] appreciated. It's easy to buy Bitcoin.
[00:34] It's hard to hold it long term. And
[00:36] that's embedded in everybody's decision.
[00:39] When you go and pitch, this is something
[00:40] that never gets talked about, but when
[00:41] we talk to our friends and family and we
[00:43] say Bitcoin, they think crypto Ponzi and
[00:46] it ends up in a North uh Korean's
[00:48] hacker's wallet or it ends up in a UK
[00:50] landfill in a zip drive. And because
[00:52] it's always seems like it's fleeting and
[00:54] it's evaporating.
[00:58] [Music]
[01:00] Before we get started with with all the
[01:02] topics, um, give us some some small
[01:04] background of like who you are and and
[01:06] why you are excited about Bitcoin.
[01:09] Uh, so to keep it brief and happy to go
[01:12] any, you know, deeper, but I think it
[01:13] helps in the stuff we're working on is,
[01:15] uh, my background is in traditional
[01:17] technology. So I grew up in Texas, uh
[01:19] was at Google helping scale one of their
[01:22] like uh side bets called fiber and uh
[01:26] deployed a lot of that. So a lot of the
[01:27] infrastructure across the US post uh
[01:30] dial up and um copper wire cable the
[01:35] incumbents recognized when you think
[01:36] about like the metas at the time
[01:38] Facebook Amazon realized they need to
[01:40] like really improve the infrastructure
[01:42] if they're going to get more data i.e.
[01:44] more ad revenue through the pipes. And
[01:46] so Google took a was in that same lens
[01:49] and they took a bet there. And so it was
[01:50] early there helping build that. And then
[01:53] um ultimately ended up in New York City
[01:55] uh as a Texas kid was interesting. My
[01:57] wife's family was from the Northeast. So
[01:59] rather than I would have opted to go to
[02:01] San Francisco. I'm glad I didn't uh
[02:03] given the
[02:05] policies gone. ended up in New York City
[02:08] and then just lo and behold I ended up
[02:09] with Adam Newman at Weiwork uh in 2017
[02:12] pre the soft bank four billion dollar
[02:14] investment and this was pre- Bitcoin um
[02:16] so this is 17 and then ultimately
[02:20] Bitcoin's price is moving I'm learning
[02:22] about Bitcoin while I'm lighting money
[02:24] on fire uh so I'm reading the Bitcoin
[02:25] standard while lighting money on fire we
[02:27] work and kind of the rest is history as
[02:29] far as going down the rabbit hole and
[02:30] getting involved in the space and and
[02:32] have been building professionally in the
[02:34] space for about half a decade now since
[02:35] 2019 19. So a little over five years.
[02:39] That's super interesting. Uh Google is
[02:41] for me as like Alphabet is one of is one
[02:44] of the companies for me in the the big
[02:46] seven that is kind of the furthest away
[02:48] from adopting something with Bitcoin
[02:50] like Meta could be because like there's
[02:52] funnel lad like Apple we've known Tim
[02:55] Cook is saying that he he owns Bitcoin
[02:57] publicly uh and all those companies. I
[03:00] don't know how do you see the
[03:01] relationship between Google and and and
[03:03] and Bitcoin? It's interesting because I
[03:06] feel
[03:07] like the the the the firms that come to
[03:10] mind the magnificent 7 are Google and
[03:12] Amazon and I think about their founding
[03:13] stories and then where they are today
[03:15] and they're kind of fundamentally
[03:16] different where when we talk about some
[03:18] of the stuff we were building and um our
[03:21] investment from early riders like they
[03:22] really embody a lot of these ethos that
[03:24] were early to what made Google and
[03:25] Amazon special. I don't know if you know
[03:27] um Amazon owns relentless.com
[03:31] uh you know and if you go to
[03:32] relentless.com it goes to Amazon and
[03:34] there was just a very deep spirit of you
[03:36] know just embodiment of ownership and
[03:40] figuring things out and hustle and if
[03:42] you go back to Google's days as well um
[03:45] it was one of the first orgs it's really
[03:46] what built the meritocracy that you see
[03:48] in traditional Silicon Valley culture
[03:51] and that exists today and even Bitcoin
[03:52] companies because they all like grafted
[03:54] on around flat architecture open up your
[03:56] calendar. I don't know if you use G
[03:58] Suite, but it's kind of like given as a,
[04:00] you know, just assume that you can if
[04:02] you log into G Suite, you can see your
[04:04] colleagues and peers calendars and you
[04:06] can figure out how to uh do but that
[04:07] like stemmed from Google because they
[04:09] had this open architecture where you
[04:10] could just show up into somebody's
[04:12] meeting and listen and chime in. And so
[04:15] um so the point is like when I hear
[04:17] Google, it feels like they should be the
[04:18] one that gets it and should be the one
[04:20] that's out exploring exploring and
[04:22] experimenting. But sadly again as a
[04:25] company grows you lose a lot of that um
[04:28] you know ownership spirit and really
[04:30] like you know the innovators dilemma
[04:32] kicks in and you're ultimately trying to
[04:34] fight to create a moat versus um build
[04:36] new products and services. So yeah, that
[04:39] I think you're right in the sense like
[04:42] the way I've had it explained to me is
[04:43] the Magnificent 7. It's hard for anybody
[04:44] that's a has a relevant business to
[04:47] start to avoid into Bitcoin because it
[04:50] really brings up questions around
[04:51] shareholder meetings and uh shareholders
[04:54] in general. It's like what's wrong with
[04:55] your business if you need to start
[04:56] buying these, you know, magic internet
[04:57] beans uh versus, you know, either buying
[04:59] back your stock or reinvesting it into
[05:01] the business. Interesting. How do you
[05:04] actually look at uh Bitcoin companies?
[05:06] So not strategy that has a business
[05:09] around uh something else and then buying
[05:11] Bitcoin but actual Bitcoin companies
[05:13] that are building in in the Bitcoin
[05:15] ecosystem like for lightning or like
[05:18] exchanges or like uh for yourself with
[05:20] on-ramp. How do you look at the the the
[05:22] startup space of of Bitcoin and the the
[05:25] builder space and the spirit of that in
[05:27] in inside of Bitcoin?
[05:29] Yeah. So I kind of have a non-conensus
[05:31] view that the best companies haven't
[05:33] been even built yet. And I'll take it a
[05:35] step back and say that the best founders
[05:37] haven't even heard of Bitcoin. Uh so,
[05:40] you know, maybe it's a little charge to
[05:42] say they haven't heard of it. Everyone's
[05:43] kind of heard of Bitcoin, especially if
[05:44] you're in technology, but they don't
[05:46] fundamentally understand Bitcoin. And I
[05:48] think most people listening probably can
[05:50] pick that up that they probably have
[05:52] friends that have allocated or bought
[05:54] some but they don't deeply understand
[05:55] how Bitcoin kind of reorients the world
[05:57] and how value is um you know delivered
[06:00] and how value is exchanged and um so the
[06:05] way to think about it is like Bitcoin's
[06:07] only 15 years into this this time period
[06:11] um into the into its story and depending
[06:14] on where you put the model you can think
[06:16] of it from like 85 5 to 2000 we're at um
[06:20] maybe give or take again in the internet
[06:22] bubble where there was a lot of
[06:23] companies you've never heard of and will
[06:25] never hear of because in general
[06:27] innovation cycles the first people
[06:29] through the door are never the ones that
[06:30] make it because it's it's a lot of work
[06:32] and you're you're having to destroy
[06:35] capital effectively and that's just
[06:36] healthy for an ecosystem. You think
[06:38] about again the 2000.com bubble there
[06:40] was a lot of companies that never
[06:41] existed. Amazon came out as well as
[06:43] others, I believe Netflix. But point
[06:45] being is we're so early and the reason
[06:48] why I share the best entrepreneurs
[06:50] haven't found Bitcoin is because I've
[06:52] been building the space for 5 years. And
[06:54] it was one of the key learnings was
[06:56] regardless of what people take say about
[06:58] the Google's Weiworks and Silicon Valley
[07:00] firms like YCback companies, they have
[07:02] some of the highest caliber people on
[07:03] the planet earth by definition because
[07:04] they running the most highc caliber
[07:06] businesses and the best talent goes
[07:09] there and the operational excellence is
[07:11] there. And coming into Bitcoin, I just
[07:13] didn't see it. It wasn't there at that
[07:14] level because you generally have
[07:15] individuals that got in early to Bitcoin
[07:17] and they decided to build a business.
[07:19] But that's very similar to somebody that
[07:20] likes to cook that decides to start a
[07:22] restaurant is generally not the best
[07:24] recipe for success. So it's not to say
[07:26] like all businesses aren't like valuable
[07:28] or won't provide value or live into the
[07:30] future. It's just that when you think
[07:32] about real mass commercial adoption and
[07:34] scale, it's not really there yet. Um
[07:37] anyway, with all that said, I will say
[07:39] that because we're so early, there's
[07:40] going to be a lot of falling forward. uh
[07:41] which is which is nice for a lot of
[07:43] individuals that have been building this
[07:44] space because at the end of the day the
[07:47] only thing scarcer than Bitcoin is
[07:48] Bitcoin talent and that's the one thing
[07:50] that these legacy companies can't get
[07:52] because Bitcoiners don't want to work
[07:54] for the incumbents. They can't they'll
[07:55] they'll uh uh we we can't we're uh we'll
[08:00] um not choke but we can't breathe in the
[08:03] environments because they don't allow
[08:05] for creativity and allow for rule
[08:07] breaking which is ultimately that's the
[08:09] bureaucracy and the fiat system and why
[08:11] people uh you know leave and start these
[08:13] companies and bitcoin provides that
[08:15] optionality because now the golden
[08:16] handcuffs don't exist instead of holding
[08:18] the shares and the Googles and Amazons
[08:20] you actually have BTC and now you have
[08:22] optionality to go start these
[08:23] businesses. is
[08:25] it's super interesting the comparison
[08:27] with the internet also with comparison
[08:29] with like Amazon, Google, all the
[08:31] Netflix even uh all all the companies
[08:34] that really grew uh big from that. Do
[08:38] you see the same need for the like in
[08:40] the internet we needed a lot of
[08:42] companies that build out a lot of things
[08:44] that are now there and we're still
[08:46] building more and more things. Is it the
[08:48] same need there in Bitcoin because it's
[08:50] like money and there's like a base
[08:52] protocol that protocol that already
[08:54] works and yeah maybe we need some
[08:55] services maybe we need some kind of
[08:57] banking system on uh on top of Bitcoin
[09:00] banking not in the traditional fiat
[09:02] banking but like people that take care
[09:03] of uh how to how to store Bitcoin. There
[09:06] will be different levels of of custody
[09:09] um and different financial services on
[09:11] top of Bitcoin. Um maybe we do need we
[09:14] maybe do not need that many companies
[09:17] that the internet needed to build the
[09:18] same thing because Bitcoin is is on its
[09:20] own already kind of good. How how do you
[09:22] look at that? No, I think it's going to
[09:25] be the opposite. There's going to be a
[09:26] lot more and the reason why is uh yeah
[09:28] so two two angles. One is the companies
[09:32] today building majority won't
[09:37] um they're they're kind of building 2D
[09:39] versions in my opinion versus they're
[09:41] looking at the world in a 2D way in the
[09:42] same way a company in 1990s in the
[09:45] internet was building in a 2D way. They
[09:46] weren't built in a dynamic nature and
[09:49] I'll I'll like I'll bring I'll reorient
[09:52] that and then I'll explain why there's
[09:53] going to be more companies. Um, so if I
[09:55] don't remind me uh to bring that up
[09:58] because it'll make sense. But going back
[10:00] to the '9s, if you think about when the
[10:01] internet started, think about in your
[10:04] country or where you were at or your
[10:05] family cuz you're probably younger to to
[10:07] remember exactly, but the internet comes
[10:09] about and you go to like time.com,
[10:11] right? A magazine. And you go to the
[10:13] page and let's say this was the
[10:15] magazine. Well, you're just putting a
[10:16] static version of the book on the actual
[10:19] website. There's nothing dynamic about
[10:21] it. There's nothing native to
[10:22] geoloccation where there's ads. There's
[10:24] it's just exactly what was been written
[10:26] for on the
[10:27] internet and it took you know roughly 15
[10:31] years when you go back to 2005 to 2008
[10:33] with the advent of mobile phones and it
[10:35] was really the iPhone when you start
[10:36] adding GPS and geoloccation and just
[10:39] just intermediation of a lot of
[10:41] applications that started to manifest
[10:43] from your phone when you think about
[10:44] Airbnb Uber Netflix streaming like it
[10:47] took that time to really start to build
[10:49] to the framework of what the internet
[10:51] could truly offer and Bitcoin's still a
[10:54] key component because you couldn't
[10:55] exchange value without an intermediary.
[10:57] So that ties in going back to why
[10:59] there's going to be a bunch more other
[11:00] companies because once you can put money
[11:02] natively through the internet, now we
[11:03] can really start to manifest what the
[11:04] internet was truly supposed to be. But
[11:07] going back to where we started is so if
[11:09] the first 15 years weren't really
[11:11] building, they were building 2D versions
[11:14] of the internet because there was
[11:15] nothing really dynamic or native, it's
[11:17] very similar to the first 15 years in
[11:19] Bitcoin. And the reason why I say that
[11:21] is because anybody people will talk
[11:25] about, well, this is a novel currency
[11:27] and it's it's disruptive and it's
[11:30] innovative, right? All the things that
[11:31] you know and folks come on your podcast
[11:32] to talk about and but then I'm going to
[11:34] anchor back to still looking in 2D. The
[11:36] best that everyone's come up with is you
[11:39] put all the Bitcoin on this little
[11:40] plastic thing or you leave it with
[11:42] Coinbase. That sounds exactly like gold.
[11:45] you know, you can hold more gold in your
[11:46] hand, uh, more Bitcoin in your hand than
[11:48] gold, but at the end of the day, it's a
[11:49] digital asset bear asset. You hold the
[11:51] private keys. And so, this isn't just
[11:55] like subjective. This is objectively
[11:56] true when you think about the amount of
[11:58] losses that have occurred in 15 years
[12:00] because you either have the story of the
[12:02] zip drive that ended up in the landfill
[12:04] or the person that gets their fingers
[12:05] chopped off because they they kidnapped
[12:07] them for their Bitcoin or it ends up
[12:09] with Mount Gaus or FTX or BlockFi. So
[12:12] for 15 years, we still built on these
[12:15] legacy models of somebody holds a stock
[12:17] or bond or gold certificate and then I
[12:19] can, you know, give up the risk and they
[12:21] have to hold and I have to ask for
[12:22] permission or I take delivery, but you
[12:26] can take delivery of anything. It
[12:27] doesn't mean you want to. There's a
[12:28] reason where gold existed and you could
[12:31] take delivery and park all your gold in
[12:32] your cave or in your citadel, but then a
[12:34] bigger militia shows up to your citadel.
[12:36] Like that's why banks exist. Like
[12:37] Bitcoin doesn't get rid of banks and now
[12:39] it changes. And this we can talk about
[12:41] on-ramp and why you know we look at as
[12:42] like a 3D version of Bitcoin because you
[12:45] kind of are now leveraging its native
[12:47] properties with multi-IG to distribute
[12:48] risk and trust. Um but hopefully does
[12:51] that help in like understanding where
[12:52] we're still so early that the the mental
[12:55] models and the way we look at the
[12:56] products and services are still building
[12:58] to the old vision or or how we like
[13:02] think about traditional architectures.
[13:04] they're not even really building in to
[13:06] the to and you can kind of squint and
[13:08] see this with like some of the noster
[13:09] and other stuff but again that's not
[13:10] really commercially viable because
[13:11] nobody's really using that stuff. It's
[13:13] an interesting perspective because I I
[13:16] do think we are super early and there's
[13:18] those numbers out is like oh like we
[13:20] added three or 4% adoption but then uh I
[13:22] ask myself like okay how many of the
[13:25] people have let's say over 20%
[13:27] allocation to Bitcoin and it's probably
[13:29] like almost none. So, so, so most people
[13:32] just have like, oh, like I delay having
[13:34] a thousand dollars on on Coinbase laying
[13:36] around. I don't know if this is already
[13:38] adopting Bitcoin in a kind of sense. So,
[13:40] the real adoption rate for me is like
[13:42] even smaller than those official numbers
[13:43] of like three, four, five, whatever
[13:45] percent. Probably like under% even. Uh,
[13:49] so yeah, we are super early and if you
[13:51] look back in the internet, uh, when were
[13:53] we at like 1% adoption? uh what you have
[13:55] seen in in in Bitcoin coming up, you
[13:58] have not in the internet adoption coming
[14:00] up, you have not seen a lot. So 1995, it
[14:02] was really hard to see what the internet
[14:05] uh actually will do with Apple, with the
[14:07] iPhone, uh with with Google, with AI and
[14:10] all all the rest of it. So I guess it's
[14:12] a really good point of we we still don't
[14:15] see what what might come in the future.
[14:18] It's exactly right. Like if you follow
[14:20] any trope, it's that you know if you
[14:22] follow the people, that's where the
[14:24] money goes, right? Like the the money
[14:26] the people the smartest minds are where
[14:29] the capital where the ideas will go. And
[14:32] so what you just shared is the key point
[14:34] backing into why the best founders and
[14:35] companies haven't been built. It's all
[14:37] just objective because that is a key
[14:39] notion that most people don't get. When
[14:41] you hear 200 million people own Bitcoin,
[14:43] it's like we we know our friends and
[14:45] family like it's not, you know, it's
[14:47] 0.1% of that 200 million have any
[14:49] material exposure, anything over call it
[14:51] 10 to or 20%. And so if that's true,
[14:54] then that means the best human capital
[14:57] has not heard or understand it deeply.
[15:00] And that's so bullish for Bitcoin
[15:01] because imagine once those great minds
[15:03] understand what's happening here,
[15:05] they're going to think of things that we
[15:06] could never dream of. And there will the
[15:08] beauty of it is like there's is I don't
[15:11] know the exact quotes I'll share the
[15:13] crude version. It's like the when two
[15:15] disperate ideas from different opposites
[15:17] come together and combine and like uh
[15:19] have sex that's when magic happens. And
[15:22] so like that's what's going to be fun is
[15:24] when you take individuals that have
[15:25] their traditional domain expertise and
[15:28] professional experiences of 10 to 20
[15:30] years and then you bring in a deep
[15:33] understanding and groin of Bitcoin.
[15:35] That's exciting. what we've seen for 15
[15:37] years is somebody that you know grew up
[15:39] in their mom's basement or kind of in
[15:41] their basement learned Bitcoin and then
[15:43] maybe started a company and that's
[15:44] fundamentally different from like how do
[15:46] you actually build a commercially viable
[15:47] long-standing business um and that's why
[15:49] it's exciting. How do you look at uh you
[15:52] you talked about it before the the
[15:54] Bitcoin talent and it's super
[15:55] interesting. I've recruited myself like
[15:57] now three freelancers uh for the for the
[16:00] podcast and it was the first time ever
[16:02] that I it was in I think January I did
[16:05] it where I put out a small tweet of like
[16:08] hey I I need an editor for for a podcast
[16:10] I cannot do it alone anymore um who
[16:13] wants to help basically like that's the
[16:15] gist of it post that I put out and I was
[16:17] astonished how many people would like to
[16:21] work for SATs because I'm like okay I I
[16:24] I would like to pay you in Bitcoin
[16:25] Actually, I prefer it because I earn in
[16:27] Bitcoin. If I can pay you in Bitcoin,
[16:29] that's that makes the whole process
[16:30] easier. Uh, and it's all remote because
[16:33] I don't have an office anyways. I'm I'm
[16:34] just like a one person small podcast.
[16:37] And I got I don't know if if if this
[16:40] shocks you or if that's something that
[16:41] you also see. I got in the first day 50
[16:44] or 60 uh applications. uh and
[16:48] I'm I've I've said it in I don't have a
[16:50] lot of money like I cannot pay any uh
[16:53] competitive salaries or anything like
[16:55] that. I said it right in the in the in
[16:57] in the thing. Uh so I think like the the
[16:59] hunger for of Bitcoiners to work in the
[17:03] Bitcoin ecosystem whatever it is I got
[17:06] regressive like hey uh I I don't know
[17:08] anything about editing but I'm willing
[17:10] to learn like I I would love to to work
[17:13] with you. So it it's it's I I see the
[17:16] hunger of people that really want to
[17:18] work in this Bitcoin industry. Maybe
[17:20] that's comparable also to to the
[17:22] internet. How do you look at like
[17:23] Bitcoin talent and and Bitcoiners also
[17:26] actually wanting not only their money in
[17:28] Bitcoin, but also like working in in
[17:30] Bitcoin? Yeah, I mean I think it makes
[17:33] complete sense. There's a lot of things
[17:35] converging outside of Bitcoin. It's kind
[17:37] of a buyer market for talent in general
[17:39] because post zero interest rate
[17:41] environment there's been a lot of
[17:42] layoffs. So there's just like a lot of
[17:43] talent in general versus before where
[17:46] you were having to really, you know,
[17:48] hunt for for for people. Um, but then
[17:51] once you get to Bitcoin, to your point,
[17:54] there's um a a lot of individuals that
[17:57] want to break into the space and get
[17:59] involved and there's not that many
[18:01] companies. So it makes complete sense.
[18:03] The other aspect of it is um so there's
[18:07] like two things I think are happening.
[18:09] One is what you said about like the flex
[18:11] or um like contract to support with your
[18:14] endeavors. I I see a future world where
[18:15] you end up almost like as a partner or a
[18:17] contractor. Meaning there's somebody
[18:19] that's doing like five different jobs or
[18:21] they're a partial owner in a business.
[18:22] There's like no middle ground with like
[18:24] employee because either you'll be able
[18:26] to leverage AI and one person can do a
[18:27] bunch of things or you'll have like a
[18:29] very key role. So that's just like a
[18:30] kind of side tangent. Um but then when
[18:33] it comes to people breaking into the
[18:35] space, it's part of uh why early
[18:37] writers. We have an investment fund.
[18:38] It's Bitcoin denominated. I believe it's
[18:40] the only one um to date. And um what was
[18:45] what's we're really excited about there
[18:47] is we have we have on-ramp our business.
[18:50] It's a private bank for Bitcoiners or
[18:52] for people with Bitcoin investors for we
[18:54] work with pensions all the way to
[18:55] individuals. And then we have this uh
[18:58] venture arm. And part of the venture arm
[19:01] being stood up is because I had a
[19:02] background in venture and understood
[19:04] that like when you're operating
[19:05] day-to-day these businesses, you get to
[19:06] spot all these gaps that like truly
[19:08] exist in the market. Not things that
[19:10] people are pitching you, but like when
[19:11] you're building and you're operating,
[19:12] you get to see like these different
[19:14] areas. And it was also the understanding
[19:17] that there's no shortage of our clients
[19:20] at Hon that ultimately at a certain
[19:23] point want to build in the ecosystem.
[19:25] But where it gets hard is and and
[19:27] everyone's kind of feels this, including
[19:28] myself, pre- getting in, is you're
[19:30] you're kind of fiat mining, right?
[19:32] You're making a nice balance. You may
[19:34] even have fiat obligations because of
[19:36] your student debt or that, you know, the
[19:37] wife's now staying at home and multiple
[19:39] kids, but the Bitcoin wealth has
[19:42] appreciated. And so now you're like,
[19:45] well shoot, I like you feel that in
[19:47] inertia to do something like whether
[19:49] it's to give back or get involved, but
[19:51] you're also not ready to stick your neck
[19:53] out completely and get off that salary,
[19:55] right? Cuz it's very addictive. I think
[19:56] I forgot who it was. I don't know if it
[19:58] was Karl Marx that said like a salary is
[19:59] the opium of the masses or something
[20:00] like that. It's like it's very easy to
[20:02] get like subdued. But the beauty of
[20:04] Bitcoin is it eventually gets you out of
[20:06] that because enough of that value
[20:07] appreciation coupled with the
[20:09] opportunity that exists in this future
[20:11] world you cannot let pass you by. And so
[20:15] why I'm bringing this up is because it's
[20:18] really our moat at the venture fund is
[20:20] we get to see these opportunities and
[20:21] whether we help and get the right
[20:24] operators because they're within our
[20:25] network that have been waiting to get
[20:27] into the space or we invest in
[20:29] individuals because they have the right
[20:31] ideas and they just need the right
[20:33] framework or company or individuals to
[20:35] help them like pull it all together. So
[20:37] it's like partial venture, partial
[20:38] studio incubation. So we have like honor
[20:40] at Mino which is the Middle East. uh
[20:42] Acropolis, which is the first Bitcoin
[20:44] treasury management company. These are
[20:45] things that we like tie together and
[20:47] chase the CEO of Acropolis, is a really
[20:49] great example of this. He was actually
[20:51] running a tech company, but he knew he
[20:53] wanted to get into Bitcoin, but it's
[20:54] hard when you're in a vacuum and like
[20:56] working in your own city and own state
[20:58] with your own family, have nobody to
[21:00] talk to about this. So part of uh early
[21:02] writers is we have the guild network and
[21:04] it basically ties all of this together
[21:06] where people are able to get like a
[21:07] member-based community to riff on their
[21:09] different disciplines and experiences
[21:11] that they like and then we start to
[21:13] organically, you know, discuss and
[21:15] figure out if it's a viable business
[21:17] opportunity. And so it ties into what
[21:19] you're saying about the amount of talent
[21:20] out there. Uh it just needs to be
[21:22] mobilized and put into the right
[21:23] direction and there's going to be some
[21:24] very exciting things built from it.
[21:27] Absolutely. And uh it's it's so funny
[21:29] because uh it it was literally yesterday
[21:32] that I posted the podcast with Chase. Uh
[21:35] I just want to I can quickly show you
[21:37] this. Uh it it it was uh literally
[21:39] yesterday uh that that I posted the
[21:42] podcast with with Chase. It was really
[21:43] interesting to talk with him about uh
[21:46] Bitcoin strategy and and all this uh
[21:48] company basically the corporate adoption
[21:50] side of of of it. So that that that's a
[21:53] fun coincidence that like once we talked
[21:55] it's literally yesterday that I posted
[21:57] the one with with with Chase and he
[21:59] comes up. Yeah, exactly. And cha and
[22:01] Chase is awesome. That team's great and
[22:03] Acropolis and is a great example of just
[22:06] seeing around corners cuz that business
[22:08] was stood up over a year ago and it was
[22:10] you know the corporate craze was growing
[22:11] but it wasn't like what it is today and
[22:13] so there's just been insane demand from
[22:15] all the way from SMMES all the way to
[22:17] corporates when they think about capital
[22:18] markets institutional grade custody all
[22:20] the things associated and so we have a
[22:23] number of examples uh across the board
[22:25] of active opportunities we're looking to
[22:26] invest in and that's what's exciting
[22:28] because to your point there's a lot of
[22:29] things that need to be built in that 3D
[22:31] version and they don't actually take a
[22:33] lot of money. That's the crazy part is
[22:35] traditional VCs and and in and the
[22:37] traditional world still looking at
[22:39] companies that they need to raise
[22:40] hundreds of millions of dollars and
[22:41] deploy tens of millions of dollars of
[22:42] companies. It's just not true. And um
[22:46] and the beauty of deploying in in
[22:48] Bitcoin is you align a lot of the
[22:51] incentives, but the other side of that
[22:53] is a lot of these companies are going to
[22:54] have to get acquired um by traditional
[22:56] financial firms because again these
[22:58] individuals do not want to work with
[22:59] them. So, it's a very exciting
[23:00] opportunity we're in. It's actually
[23:02] something really interesting because we
[23:04] talked about Chase and we talked about
[23:06] uh bit Bitcoin strategy a little bit. Uh
[23:09] and you said I think I don't know if you
[23:10] said it before the recording or in the
[23:12] beginning of the recording um that that
[23:14] you have an interesting uh opinion on
[23:17] like Bitcoin and Treasury companies and
[23:19] corporate treasury companies. Um, how do
[23:21] you look at uh all the new companies
[23:24] that now come in like a strategy as
[23:26] semi-cientific uh and and more and more
[23:29] companies that come in and say like hey
[23:31] we do a business that has nothing to do
[23:33] with Bitcoin but we want to acquire as
[23:35] many Bitcoin as possible and even have
[23:37] like employees that just like try to get
[23:40] more Bitcoin and have this kind of
[23:42] speculative attack on on fiat and and
[23:44] getting more Bitcoin. I've I've had like
[23:46] um an aversion to it and it stems from
[23:49] multiple things. If you ask me on a
[23:50] particular day, I I'll come up with a
[23:52] different main reason, but at the the
[23:54] net net is I personally don't really
[23:56] like it. Um but I will caveat because
[23:59] it's important. Everything's good for
[24:01] Bitcoin, right? And at the end of the
[24:02] day, if this thing causes the price to
[24:04] go up and more people know about
[24:06] Bitcoin, well then more people are going
[24:08] to find out about it. But you can say
[24:10] that exact same thing about FTX and
[24:12] BlockFi. they cause more people to get
[24:13] burned and understand about counterparty
[24:15] risk. That doesn't mean like people
[24:16] don't get hurt. Um and so sure the price
[24:20] goes up but it's kind of an inorganic
[24:23] price going up from multiple functions.
[24:25] One is because obviously fiat in general
[24:28] is inorganic and so cap t c t c t c t c
[24:30] t c t c t c t c t c t c t c t c t c t c
[24:30] t c t c t c t c t c t capping the
[24:30] capital markets um to naturally bid up
[24:33] the
[24:34] price you know the marginal cost to
[24:36] produce those dollars is zero and so the
[24:38] marginal price to you know produce those
[24:39] shares is effectively zero. So those
[24:41] generally trend back to zero. And so I
[24:44] think about it like the lottery, right?
[24:45] Like and maybe to like anchor this even
[24:47] better, it's like sure like traders can
[24:50] make more Bitcoin if they dominate their
[24:52] units in Bitcoin. The reason why traders
[24:53] don't make much money is a they're not
[24:55] good at trading, but b they're trying to
[24:56] make more dollars. And it's really hard
[24:57] to make more Bitcoin when you're trying
[24:58] to make dollars. In the same way, a lot
[25:00] of these corporate treasuries aren't
[25:02] really run by Bitcoiners. They're run by
[25:03] people that like Bitcoin that may have a
[25:05] small percentage. You know, the point we
[25:06] talked about earlier, most people don't
[25:08] have material exposure to Bitcoin. Even
[25:10] the people that are loud on Twitter, a
[25:12] lot of them don't. And so you take
[25:14] somebody that has a portfolio of less
[25:16] than five to 10% and then they're
[25:18] running a corporate treasury strategy
[25:19] around adopting Bitcoin. I liken it to
[25:21] like winning the lotto, right? Like you
[25:22] can give somebody the lotto, but
[25:23] eventually over a long enough time
[25:24] horizon, there's enough studies that you
[25:26] give all the money back. And that's how
[25:28] I think of this inorganic like
[25:30] consumption. and you're taking a vehicle
[25:32] to take a finite unit with infinite
[25:35] dollars and you're hoping to god like
[25:37] it's going to not only continue to
[25:39] deliver some theoretical value, but then
[25:41] the people buying these shares are going
[25:44] to end up with quote unquote more
[25:45] Bitcoin than less. And it just doesn't
[25:47] make sense because they're inherently
[25:49] going to be more volatile than Bitcoin.
[25:51] And so think about Bitcoin's profile of
[25:53] volatility and how many people get
[25:54] shaken out when they buy Bitcoin in
[25:56] itself. Well, imagine buying shares in a
[25:59] company that's buying Bitcoin and the
[26:01] volatility and as the price retraces now
[26:04] you don't fully understand what you're
[26:05] holding. You're not you're going to have
[26:07] paper hands. And the last part in all of
[26:10] it is that it's almost like an affinity
[26:14] scam in my mind because if you think
[26:17] about like the thing and I talked about
[26:19] this on Stephan Labbera's podcast um is
[26:23] we kind of forget being deep in the
[26:24] Bitcoin space how hard it is for
[26:26] somebody to wrap their heads around
[26:27] buying you know a magic internet token
[26:30] right like again it's easy to buy in
[26:33] self-custody 12 words for $10 or $100
[26:36] but imagine telling somebody it's worth
[26:37] $100 million put $10 million, 10% of
[26:40] your net worth on 12 words in a plastic
[26:42] device. They'll just laugh at you. And
[26:45] so the the majority of the world, the
[26:49] understanding is a 60/40 portfolio. 60%
[26:51] stocks, 40% bonds. So it's not out of
[26:55] the question for somebody in their 6040
[26:56] to have some material exposure to an
[26:58] Amazon or some fang company, right? Like
[27:00] it's easy in their mental model. So you
[27:03] can see how it's easy for securities to
[27:06] be like naturally part of somebody's
[27:08] portfolio to Bitcoin proxy exposure. So
[27:10] are they going to buy some of these, you
[27:12] know, companies? Are they going to
[27:14] understand what they're buying? Are they
[27:15] going to be able to withstand the
[27:16] volatility? So they're going to buy like
[27:18] everyone buys even Bitcoin as a momentum
[27:20] trade, but then they end up as exit
[27:22] liquidity because they don't
[27:23] fundamentally understand what they're
[27:24] holding because we know Bitcoin has the
[27:26] cycles and even if we are not in a
[27:28] traditional four-year cycle anymore,
[27:30] it'll always have a volatility because
[27:32] you only have 21 million, you have all
[27:34] these units chasing it. So I probably
[27:36] didn't do the best way to explain it all
[27:38] together, but you can kind of see how
[27:39] these gaps leave a lot of people holding
[27:41] less Bitcoin than more if they would
[27:43] have just bought spot
[27:45] bitcoin. Yeah, that that's a fair like
[27:48] and it it's uh it's something that I've
[27:50] never did actually. I I always stayed
[27:52] away from not having uh the Bitcoin
[27:55] itself. I always wanted to have real
[27:57] Bitcoin and and and do and and not like
[28:01] Ius on Bitcoin or indirect bitcoin
[28:03] related products like strategy or like
[28:06] whatever you you can buy or block fights
[28:08] was the same same thing or holding it on
[28:10] on exchange. Um, but you are also
[28:13] against uh just companies buying Bitcoin
[28:17] with with the cash they have basically
[28:18] converting fiat to Bitcoin. No, not at
[28:22] all. So that's a what everyone's going
[28:24] to do and b that's the most exciting
[28:27] thing to me is companies that are
[28:29] actually producing value to the world
[28:31] and then sweeping that value into the
[28:33] hardest form of money because then
[28:35] that's a competitive moat in itself
[28:37] because now they are not going to suffer
[28:39] from the debasement of their corporate
[28:41] treasury. And if you're not suffering
[28:43] from debasement well then you're
[28:45] naturally going to be uh you are going
[28:48] to mitigate any um risk when it comes to
[28:51] inflation. So you don't actually have to
[28:52] raise your prices. So you don't have to
[28:54] lose mar you don't have that margin
[28:55] compression you don't have the
[28:56] degradation right something people don't
[28:58] talk about but in the traditional
[28:59] economy we all feel it when you go buy
[29:01] food or you get a product it's all like
[29:03] subpar because inflation creeps in in
[29:05] different ways. You've heard of shrink
[29:06] inflation. And so point being is when
[29:09] you hold a better form of money now you
[29:10] get to be aggressive and not only do you
[29:12] not have to raise your prices but you
[29:14] can go buy out competitors. But again,
[29:16] it ties into people like to conflate it.
[29:18] But just because you hold a big Bitcoin
[29:20] treasury strategy doesn't mean you're
[29:22] going to be a kingmaker in the future
[29:23] world because if you don't know what
[29:24] you're doing and you just know how to
[29:25] play the capital markets, it's just
[29:27] again like winning the lotto, you don't
[29:29] know how to make the money. You can go
[29:30] buy the ticket and you may get all the
[29:32] money, but you're going to give it back
[29:33] to the market whether it's 5 years, 10
[29:34] years, or 50 years, you're going to give
[29:36] it back because it's it's not really
[29:37] your money, basically. That's super
[29:39] interesting. I always had um a critical
[29:43] stand on on nations buying Bitcoin
[29:45] because I don't like the ideas that
[29:47] nations uh buy by buy Bitcoin when when
[29:50] there are so many individuals not even
[29:52] holding Bitcoin yet like like let's
[29:55] let's put the nations buying as as long
[29:58] uh off as possible uh with corporations
[30:01] I mean it's just like a smaller version
[30:04] of that uh but it's it's like natural
[30:08] occurring. How do you look at nations
[30:10] buying Bitcoin now and and having a
[30:11] strategic uh Bitcoin reserve? I mean
[30:13] there's not too much going on but like
[30:15] US is is kind of coming a little bit in
[30:17] that.
[30:19] Yeah, I would flip it. I would say I'm
[30:21] probably more at least personally and
[30:22] can walk through where makes more sense
[30:24] for nations to buy Bitcoin than the
[30:26] corporate because the corporate is
[30:28] ultimately
[30:30] leveraging again the fiat capital
[30:33] markets to buy this asset. And the like
[30:36] it mirror is very similar to like FTX
[30:38] and BlockFine Celsius. Nobody ever talks
[30:40] about where did all the Bitcoin go, but
[30:41] we know it ended up in a lot of people's
[30:42] pockets that it probably shouldn't have.
[30:44] And that's where I kind of see this
[30:45] ending up is like these corporates will
[30:47] end up not holding the Bitcoin or
[30:49] something will happen and we'll always
[30:50] just call it animal spirits, but we
[30:52] won't know where the Bitcoin goes versus
[30:55] the
[30:56] sovereign. It's more organic in my view
[30:58] in the sense of like one is we've seen
[31:00] hash rate hash rates kind of completely
[31:02] exploded. It's always up into the right,
[31:03] but the past 24 months has been
[31:05] increasingly kind of like parabolic. And
[31:08] the understanding is that there's a lot
[31:10] of nation states mining because that's
[31:11] like, you know, covert uh acquisition of
[31:13] ETC because you take your natural
[31:15] resources, right? And you're from a
[31:17] geopolitical perspective, you're playing
[31:19] the game theory out. You're using your
[31:21] resources to mine the asset. So that's
[31:24] one aspect. The other one is more from
[31:27] just a pure self-preservation. when you
[31:29] think about every region when you think
[31:31] about there's no such thing as what um
[31:33] what's the term like netneutral export
[31:35] you know every country has its own
[31:36] exports and import um you know balances
[31:39] because you know Russia you think about
[31:41] what they produce there and then what
[31:43] they need and as the price of goods and
[31:46] services goes up they need a better form
[31:48] of money to protect their citizens right
[31:50] their constituents so if they're holding
[31:52] Bitcoin from a game theory perspective
[31:55] they're going to be able to protect
[31:56] their citizens when they need to
[31:57] naturally buy let's say they need to
[31:59] import wheat. Uh just as an example, it
[32:01] could be any country and that's
[32:03] self-preservation because if you are
[32:04] holding treasuries and you can have them
[32:06] turned off or you're holding gold and US
[32:09] decides to you know get rid of gold or
[32:11] we start mining gold from space whatever
[32:12] the term is like well you're kind of so
[32:15] you're in a bad position if you have to
[32:16] feed your citizens now that you're old.
[32:19] So it kind of makes sense to me on the
[32:20] the nation state level more than the
[32:22] corporate level simply because it's a it
[32:24] goes back to the individual. the
[32:26] individual is producing their value to
[32:29] protect their own purchasing power. So
[32:31] like on the micro and macro example, but
[32:32] then there's this like intermediate play
[32:35] which is uh this like zombie version of
[32:37] set up a shell company, leverage a fiat
[32:39] system, dump on shareholders and call it
[32:41] innovation that I'm kind of averse to.
[32:44] Yeah.
[32:46] In general, I'm always like like the
[32:49] word innovation is for me so washed out
[32:52] already or like paradigm shift and all
[32:55] those words because so many people use
[32:58] it in so many different ways. I mean,
[33:00] it's a side tangent now, but it's like
[33:03] the uh people use the word innovation
[33:06] for things that clearly aren't
[33:07] innovations. And so, the word kind of
[33:10] lost its its meaning for for me if if
[33:14] that's what you you also meant with
[33:15] that. Yeah. And I think a lot of this
[33:17] just comes back to in the in the fiat
[33:19] system, it's very much heavily
[33:21] incentivized from rent extraction,
[33:23] right? You think about Wall Street and
[33:24] it goes back to products and fees. And
[33:26] that's basically what these products
[33:27] are. They're like individuals I think
[33:30] that forgot either how to deliver value
[33:32] to the world or ultimately are choosing
[33:34] to take the easier path. But in life
[33:37] it's really simple because if you've
[33:38] ever heard the term easy choices hard
[33:40] life, hard choices easy life. Like the
[33:42] fact is
[33:44] that you know whether it's an individual
[33:47] or corporate or institution, a lot of
[33:50] the the story or narrative you'll hear
[33:52] is that institutions can't buy Bitcoin
[33:53] so they buy these equities. And like I
[33:55] don't I don't believe that. um simply
[33:58] because those people don't understand
[33:59] Bitcoin. Because if they understood
[34:01] Bitcoin, you're telling me that the most
[34:02] sophisticated investors on the planet
[34:04] Earth can't figure out some way to get
[34:05] exposure to spot BTC. And so the angle
[34:08] is that even if that was true, it can
[34:12] partially be true, but I don't think it
[34:13] is. But let's say it was. And now you
[34:15] get exposure to Micro Strategy. Micro
[34:17] Strategy does its thing and somebody at
[34:20] the board level, you know, because
[34:21] there's all these large companies
[34:22] holding Micro Strategy starts to sit
[34:24] around and it's like, "Holy crap, this
[34:26] Bitcoin thing is actually going to $10
[34:27] million or whatever." Well, you think
[34:29] they're going to keep buying Micro
[34:30] Strategy that has, you know, execution
[34:31] risk, counterparty risk, all things.
[34:33] Then where does the coin the asset sit?
[34:35] or are they gonna go figure out how to
[34:36] buy the spot and hold it in some, you
[34:39] know, we could talk about what we do at
[34:40] multi institution if you want, but
[34:41] they're gonna they're gonna put it in a
[34:43] way that protects their purchasing power
[34:44] because any individ just like how an
[34:46] individual can't afford to get knocked
[34:48] out of the game because strategy or
[34:50] whoever the corporate gets rugged and
[34:52] now you lose your whole, you know, your
[34:54] whole net worth is the same way that
[34:55] these individuals will eventually think.
[34:57] So, this ties back to sure as the price
[34:59] goes up, but as fast as the price goes
[35:01] up is as quick as it can go down. And
[35:03] that's ultimately where this leads
[35:04] because it doesn't make any sense to
[35:06] have a security wrapper around an a
[35:09] digital bearer asset. Yeah. You want to
[35:11] have
[35:13] you want to have the real thing. You
[35:15] want to have spot bitcoin and and not
[35:16] like a security or IU or anything like
[35:18] that. Um I'm I'm and I want to get to
[35:21] what on is doing. Uh one more thing that
[35:24] I want to get before is uh what do you
[35:26] think long term when we think about a
[35:29] fiat world and a bitcoin world and how
[35:31] different those those two paradigms are
[35:33] and we already talked in the beginning
[35:34] how super early we are and how how hard
[35:37] it is to imagine what actually is coming
[35:39] in the future. How do you think Bitcoin
[35:41] will in general impact companies, the
[35:44] startup world, the venture capital world
[35:46] when the hurdle rate all of a sudden is
[35:48] is Bitcoin and uh not fear? So it's the
[35:51] hurdle rate is something appreciating
[35:53] and not depreciating what we with with
[35:55] fear. They're not going to be able to
[35:56] breathe. They're going to they're going
[35:58] to probably die. Um uh the the old
[36:01] companies, the incumbents and then there
[36:03] will be net new companies. Uh this ties
[36:05] into our venture capital firm is called
[36:08] early riders. And the name stems from
[36:10] having to not only pitch and talk to the
[36:13] largest institutions in the world about
[36:14] holding keys in our multi-institution
[36:16] forum and some getting it, others not.
[36:18] But even if they got it, there's so much
[36:20] bureaucracy that exists that they may
[36:22] not be able to move fast enough. and
[36:24] also going deep down the rabbit hole,
[36:26] you know, and looking at AI and
[36:28] realizing how disruptive it is that
[36:30] these technologies are so disruptive
[36:32] that the incumbents will not be able to
[36:34] fully adopt or embrace them because they
[36:36] disrupt their whole business model,
[36:38] right? So there's there's that angle of
[36:40] the traditional company like you think
[36:42] about a large firm like Charles Schwab
[36:44] and the amount of individuals like
[36:46] financial advisors are a great example
[36:47] because yes financial advisors provide
[36:49] value in the same way travel agents
[36:51] provide value but you don't need that
[36:52] many travel agents once the internet
[36:54] came about same way you're not going to
[36:55] need that many financial advisors so
[36:57] those models cannot they cannot like
[36:59] they won't fully embrace it and so
[37:01] they'll get left behind it's very
[37:02] similar to like Blockbuster Netflix but
[37:04] then to take it a step further is when
[37:07] you think about traditional companies
[37:10] Um, and we talked about this on our last
[37:12] trade podcast with Tad Smith where he
[37:13] was referencing at a certain point when
[37:16] a company is starting to adopt a Bitcoin
[37:17] treasury strategy, what they're
[37:19] effectively doing is incepting Bitcoin
[37:21] as the hurdle rate and almost like
[37:23] collapsing their business. Um, because
[37:26] either they are going to have to realize
[37:29] that every spend has to eventually net
[37:33] out more Bitcoin or not make the spend
[37:34] because you could just buy the Bitcoin
[37:35] with the cash flow. Um, and so that kind
[37:38] of changes their model. But again, these
[37:40] companies aren't siloed. Like there's so
[37:42] much fat and bureaucracy and different,
[37:44] you know, crossf functional groups. Like
[37:46] by the time that happens, what we're
[37:49] investing in and what we've done
[37:50] personally
[37:52] is it's I call it the character stick.
[37:54] So let's pretend you Robin are at a big
[37:56] tech company, right? And you have a
[37:58] professional experience uh and you're a
[38:01] good employee. you're trying to help
[38:02] your manager or your founder, whoever
[38:05] you're working with, like see Bitcoin,
[38:06] like get this because it's going to help
[38:08] the company. And then by that notion,
[38:10] everyone listening knows that once you
[38:11] see Bitcoin, you start to see the world
[38:12] in a more efficient, dynamic way. It's
[38:14] kind of like seeing truth, right? That's
[38:16] where the food and all this stuff starts
[38:17] to come in as part of what we're doing.
[38:19] And um you're like, "Look, we got to do
[38:21] this. We got to use AI. We got to like
[38:22] deal with this." And they're just like,
[38:23] "Nah, it's cool. Go back in your
[38:24] corner." And so that's your carrot. The
[38:27] carrot is you're trying to help them.
[38:28] And the stick is like, "All right, I'm
[38:30] out. I got enough Bitcoin on my own
[38:32] personal balance sheet. I know where all
[38:34] the bodies are buried and I'm going to
[38:36] go and I can see where other competitors
[38:38] bodies are buried. And now I can infuse
[38:39] two or three things together and I can
[38:41] rebuild what you guys built 10 to 100x
[38:44] faster at onetenth to 1/100th of the
[38:47] cost. And not only that, I'm going to
[38:50] use a base level money which is Bitcoin
[38:53] and not only appreciates but I'm going
[38:55] to sweep all my free cash flow. So while
[38:57] you are all suffering from margin
[38:58] compression and inflation, I'm going to
[39:00] be out competing you. And that's the
[39:02] definition of early riders. It's the
[39:04] early riders are going to rebuild this
[39:05] world in the way that you're describing.
[39:07] And that's who basically we're investing
[39:08] in and backing or companies or
[39:10] individuals that already gro this. Let's
[39:12] take a break for a moment and appreciate
[39:15] the beauty that Coin Vigilante has made
[39:18] with the Bitcoin watches. Those watches
[39:21] are the most amazing, the most eleigent
[39:23] way of showing that you are a true
[39:26] Bitcoiner. And Coin Vigilante just
[39:29] dropped a completely new and amazing
[39:32] Genesis edition of their watch
[39:34] collections. You have the date of the
[39:37] first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[39:40] there. And of course, also the block
[39:42] height and which epoch we are currently
[39:45] in. I love the level of detail they put
[39:48] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[39:50] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[39:53] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[39:56] love those watches so so much. And now,
[39:59] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[40:02] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[40:04] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[40:05] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[40:08] first way is you put it on a hardware
[40:10] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[40:13] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[40:16] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[40:19] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[40:22] if you check out the link in the
[40:23] description, you even get 5% off if you
[40:26] use the code Robin. And the second way
[40:29] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[40:32] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[40:35] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[40:38] They will personalize for you a
[40:41] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[40:43] your individual situation. They will
[40:46] show you how you can secure your own
[40:48] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[40:51] enough. You also have to keep all your
[40:53] devices secure. One topic that is
[40:55] overlooked often is the inheritance
[40:58] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[41:01] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[41:03] a plan for that in place already? And
[41:06] last but not least, if you're in a
[41:07] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[41:10] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[41:12] that, head over to the
[41:16] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[41:19] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[41:22] be for the first time ever speaking at
[41:24] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[41:27] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[41:30] really looking forward to seeing all of
[41:32] you there. You can get your ticket in
[41:34] the link down in the description of
[41:36] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[41:39] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[41:43] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[41:44] there. I also heard you talking about I
[41:47] don't remember which podcast, but uh on
[41:49] another podcast talking about the real
[41:50] productivity measured with Bitcoin per
[41:53] employee, if I got that right. uh how do
[41:55] you look at at that of like measuring
[41:59] everything in Bitcoin like Bitcoin per
[42:01] share, Bitcoin per employee, Bitcoin per
[42:04] whatever. Yeah. So I think directionally
[42:06] a lot of this stuff like right now in
[42:07] the corporate stuff they're throwing
[42:08] these crazy like acronyms and things out
[42:10] that they're not really Bitcoin per
[42:12] anything. It's just paper because you
[42:13] don't own any Bitcoin. So they can say
[42:15] per Bitcoin per what's owned. But the
[42:18] real way I think about it is um it just
[42:21] flips the models of the traditional
[42:22] world, right? So the traditional uh like
[42:25] technology or finance world is aum in an
[42:28] investment fund, right? Like how much
[42:30] capital can you raise in a fund? How
[42:32] large is your your fund? But when you
[42:34] think about that, it's actually going to
[42:35] be the opposite because the amount of
[42:36] capital you deployed or raised, people
[42:38] are going to back test and run into how
[42:40] much Bitcoin was that and they're never
[42:41] going to be able to make that Bitcoin
[42:43] back. So when they could have just
[42:44] bought the Bitcoin and been fine, right?
[42:45] So people that are raising hundreds of
[42:47] millions of dollars, billions of dollars
[42:48] will look that as negative in the future
[42:49] because like well did you return that
[42:51] amount of Bitcoin? And so it kind of
[42:52] flips that. And in the same way when you
[42:55] look at a company the usual heruristic
[42:56] previously was like oh success is how
[42:58] large is your company? Like if you ever
[43:00] worked at a large company they love
[43:01] being managers of 30 50. Your headcount
[43:03] is the thing. But in reality and there's
[43:06] two paths converging. There's
[43:07] deflationary tech like AI that's you
[43:09] know everyone talks about the the first
[43:11] person company that will build a billion
[43:12] dollar business. But you tie that um
[43:17] tailwind of AI and deflationary tech
[43:19] like software or SAS in general and then
[43:22] Bitcoin and now you're going to look at
[43:24] the amount of revenue u BTC netted out
[43:27] per employee like the amount that you
[43:29] can do and like Tether's I guess a kind
[43:30] of a good example of this. Um but so
[43:34] yeah, it just kind of flips what you're
[43:35] you're looking at because everyone's
[43:36] chasing the underlying BTC to make more
[43:39] of it. That'll be how people return. You
[43:41] know, they think about their capital
[43:42] investing into a VC fund or investing
[43:45] directly into a Bitcoin company is how
[43:47] much Bitcoin are you returning to me?
[43:49] Um, so yeah, I love that. Like how how
[43:53] much Bitcoin profits are you doing per
[43:55] employee? Some stuff like that. Really
[43:57] interesting. Um, uh, one one more thing
[43:59] is uh interesting. I with with AI
[44:03] because we talked about it a little bit
[44:04] now. Um, I heard I think it was Shopify
[44:08] the CEO uh who said if you want to
[44:11] increase headcount at Shopify, a manager
[44:13] at Shopify, you now have to explain why
[44:17] AI couldn't do that. So like like the
[44:20] the reverse of that like uh ex show me
[44:23] why we need an employee and not can just
[44:26] do it with AI. um which makes it super
[44:30] interesting with the what Jeff Bou is
[44:33] also talking about the deflationary
[44:35] aspect of of uh uh Bitcoin and then the
[44:38] efficiency is rising with with
[44:40] productivity and and technology. What do
[44:42] you think is the AI impact on on on
[44:45] Bitcoin? Yeah, AI and Bitcoin are are
[44:48] fascinating. Um there's a lot there to
[44:51] go back to what you were saying. you
[44:52] know, I I'll butcher this, but
[44:54] directionally it'll make sense, and I
[44:55] got to go figure out where, but
[44:57] basically like there's Metaf's law,
[45:00] which is um
[45:02] uh like squaring uh the connectivity.
[45:06] So, Metaf invented Ethernet, and it was
[45:08] this notion that as you create more
[45:09] connectivity with computers, you are
[45:11] going to um exponentially increase the
[45:13] amount of distribution. And I forget who
[45:16] did it but it was basically recognizing
[45:18] when you um infuse or like interject
[45:22] Metcaf's law with Moore's law right so
[45:25] Metaf's law is distribution increase
[45:27] Moore's law is decreasing of the capital
[45:30] cost for software right you're naturally
[45:33] going to open up uh the the internet
[45:36] you're going to open up the ability to
[45:38] think about SAS and software these large
[45:40] technology companies and what's exciting
[45:44] about AI Bitcoin is you're taking those
[45:46] two things and then you're just grafting
[45:47] on now a net new thing which is like AI
[45:51] that is able to like AI I think they're
[45:54] very similar in like AI is in this model
[45:58] is take those two and those were huge
[45:59] for mental models of the technology boom
[46:02] where Moors law is AI so Moors law is
[46:06] reducing the cost for individuals and
[46:08] and compute and the things that are
[46:09] needed to build and then metastas law is
[46:12] bitcoin because now you're connected
[46:13] everyone to a digital native money,
[46:16] right? And so like you're combining that
[46:17] and that's where like it's nobody's
[46:18] talking about this yet because it's
[46:19] still so early. But when you put all
[46:22] that together and it ties to what you
[46:23] talked about earlier about like well
[46:25] will companies look different or how
[46:26] many more companies will have Bitcoin.
[46:27] It's like everything because we haven't
[46:29] infused money into everything we do
[46:31] online and it'll naturally be part of it
[46:33] whether it's through commerce or
[46:34] interactions via like watching videos or
[46:37] streaming music. And so AI is
[46:42] interesting because
[46:45] um it's a deep rabbit hole whether it's
[46:47] the convergence of compute and power
[46:51] right when you think about like it's a
[46:52] hard one to talk about cuz I haven't
[46:53] fully wrapped my head around but there's
[46:55] a very deep synergy happening with
[46:58] Bitcoin and AI and energy that will
[47:02] change like if you go far enough down
[47:04] the rabbit hole we talk with like Matt
[47:06] Pines you can start to like make cases
[47:07] how Bitcoin was sent from the future to
[47:09] come back to self-regulate
[47:12] uh when it comes to energy and basically
[47:14] us ending ourselves because you have to
[47:16] pay AI you have to pay the energy source
[47:19] and if you have infinite money meaning
[47:21] like CBDC's or stable coins or dollars
[47:24] that ends up negative but when you have
[47:25] a decentralized money that's completely
[47:27] different that's self-regulating itself
[47:29] and so there's an interesting like
[47:30] convergence there but that's more of
[47:32] like a meta angle just in general like
[47:34] it makes complete sense if you have u AI
[47:36] that is natively on the internet you
[47:38] need in an internet form of money that's
[47:39] native um to you know whether it's
[47:42] payment or just to uh manage. Yeah, I
[47:46] cannot imagine an AI agent having a bank
[47:48] account, but I can imagine them dealing
[47:50] with with Bitcoin addresses and and
[47:52] sending bitcoins around AI agents to
[47:55] other AI agents. Yeah. and the
[47:57] topography around lightning and just in
[47:59] general routing like that's a lot uh of
[48:02] stuff that you'll see where once the
[48:04] models and the understanding again it's
[48:06] some of the best kind of like um
[48:08] researchers when it comes to traditional
[48:09] AI models start to deeply understand
[48:11] Bitcoin and aren't thinking about crypto
[48:13] and looking at lightning and topography
[48:15] there how it maps to the general
[48:17] topography of the internet and networks
[48:19] and then you infuse AI with lightning
[48:21] and payments and build those different
[48:23] nodes like all of that's coming but um
[48:25] it actually probably is a lot sooner
[48:27] than we recognize because of how fast
[48:28] things are compounding when it comes
[48:30] from a technology perspective.
[48:32] Absolutely. And and now the last topic
[48:35] I'm really interested in and what are
[48:36] you doing with with On-Ramp uh and and
[48:39] what are you kind of building uh there?
[48:41] Yeah, so on is a pretty simple premise.
[48:44] Um my background for now a little over 5
[48:47] years has been building Bitcoin
[48:48] infrastructure. Um I was you know the
[48:52] the journey was similar to a lot of
[48:54] individuals. you go down the rabbit
[48:55] hole, you start allocating small amounts
[48:57] and ends up being most of your wealth
[48:58] into Bitcoin and um had it on an
[49:01] exchange and realized I needed to get it
[49:03] off the exchanges back in like 2017 18
[49:06] and I was you know I as much as I got
[49:09] comfortable with hardware devices I
[49:10] couldn't like risk putting all my money
[49:12] and being alone on an island here. I
[49:13] just couldn't get there. I credit a lot
[49:14] of people for doing it because this is
[49:15] where the majority of money still sits
[49:17] in Bitcoin on this device because Ledger
[49:18] has a majority of uh market share and
[49:21] then the majority of Bitcoin sits with
[49:24] individuals and um so I ended up going
[49:26] down the collaborative custody rabbit
[49:28] hole. I was an early client uh of
[49:30] Unchained when they spun out from the
[49:31] loan product and then became very
[49:33] friendly with Parker Lewis there and and
[49:34] helped build that business. So I joined
[49:36] in u we were talking in 2019, I joined
[49:38] in 2020 because the market was volatile
[49:41] and so really built that business from
[49:42] the ground up. We onboarded, you know,
[49:44] thousands of people, billions of
[49:45] dollars. But while I was doing that, um,
[49:48] naturally spotted just this very large
[49:50] significant gap, whether it was with
[49:51] high net worth all the way to corporates
[49:53] and fiduciaries that at the end of the
[49:55] day, they just didn't want to hold these
[49:56] these keys. They didn't want to hold
[49:57] them for a number of reasons, some of
[49:59] the wrong reasons, right? Like just
[50:01] because they could lose their car keys
[50:02] when in reality, you can figure that
[50:05] out. But again, that ties back to do you
[50:07] want to make money or do you want to be
[50:08] right? because I could tell everyone
[50:10] should be holding their keys but the
[50:11] reality is not everybody wants to be
[50:12] their bank and that nor should they
[50:14] because if everyone was their bank that
[50:15] opens up a lot of risk from like
[50:17] physical attack that's why banks have
[50:19] existed and uh once you get to you know
[50:22] businesses fiduciaries people money
[50:24] managing money for others it's untenable
[50:27] to hold cryptographic material because
[50:30] you have seed phrases you have hardware
[50:31] devices not only can you mess them up
[50:33] but if somebody leaves the firm now you
[50:35] have to burn a lot of this information
[50:37] because if they believe they may have a
[50:39] piece of it and now you start to expose
[50:41] yourself. And so that's really where
[50:43] this notion of multi-institution custody
[50:45] came out and it's really simple. It
[50:47] leverages Bitcoin's native property
[50:49] multisig. It's open source and
[50:51] interoperable but with a slight caveat
[50:53] that we use institutional grade
[50:55] custodians. So it's a difference between
[50:57] how a hardware key is generally stood up
[50:59] when you think about a ledger coldard
[51:01] treasure where it's a direct onetoone
[51:03] relationship seed phrase and hardware
[51:04] device. This is institutional grade uh
[51:07] key generation where there shards of a
[51:09] single key held by different
[51:11] institutions. But where this gets really
[51:14] elegant is the client. All of this is
[51:17] obiscated and we got it down. Previously
[51:20] in my life at Unchained, it took two to
[51:21] eight weeks to onboard people. I think
[51:22] it's faster now, but you still have to
[51:24] ship the devices. You have to onboard.
[51:25] You have to put the seed phrases, the
[51:26] wallet config file. You have to back
[51:28] them up. If you do it correctly, you
[51:29] should have it in four different
[51:30] locations. Most people don't have four
[51:32] different places. And then now, and
[51:35] something we've been a little quieter
[51:36] about because it sounds like FUD, but it
[51:39] makes logical sense. It was coming is
[51:40] the amount of physical attacks um that
[51:42] are coming. And I don't know if you if
[51:44] you saw the Wall Street Journal had an
[51:46] article. I forgot what it was titled,
[51:48] but it was something to the tune of like
[51:50] crypto elite get their fingers chopped
[51:51] off because like people are now starting
[51:53] to get kidnapped because all the data is
[51:55] out there. This is also something that
[51:56] we didn't want to talk about, but the
[51:58] reality is every CRM has been hacked or
[52:00] will eventually be hacked because data
[52:02] is data. And in Coinbase instance, I
[52:04] think they were like selling the data,
[52:05] their employees uh to people. So all
[52:07] this data is out there. Now you have
[52:09] chain analysis and AI tools. You can
[52:11] pretty much discern almost any person's
[52:13] balance as great as their operational
[52:15] security was. Unless they were mining it
[52:16] or buying OTC in a back alley in 2010,
[52:20] you can pretty much figure out whose
[52:21] balance and what somebody holds. And so
[52:24] now everyone's exposed. And so this
[52:26] notion of multi-institution custody
[52:28] takes a lot of that out of the picture
[52:30] because you can onboard in minutes. You
[52:32] have three different independent
[52:33] institutions that are working on your
[52:34] behalf. So they're agents of the client
[52:37] and the client directs them via video
[52:39] verification and over time we'll do it
[52:41] in person and have other kind of 3FA
[52:43] mechanisms to like authenticate because
[52:45] I know the natural question is like what
[52:46] happens with AI? Um, but the point being
[52:49] is it's all onchain segregated. So, it
[52:52] looks like a traditional brokerage
[52:54] account. You can go in, buy Bitcoin, get
[52:56] direct spot exposure, get an IRA,
[52:58] lending, everything you would want. But
[53:00] you're not worried about if I travel, do
[53:02] I take my keys with me? Cuz if I bring
[53:05] them, I have a problem, right? But if I
[53:07] don't bring them, then I also have a
[53:08] problem because who's at my house? And
[53:10] so it just naturally allows for
[53:12] individuals not only to build more
[53:14] material positions, but just net new
[53:16] people, not have to go through, do I buy
[53:17] an ETF, do I buy a micro strategy, do I
[53:19] do all this? It's like, no, you can just
[53:20] click a button. And I liken it to like
[53:22] the browser. You know, in 1995, Mosaic
[53:25] came out and it was the access to the
[53:26] worldwide web. It opened up a
[53:28] democratized ability for everybody on
[53:30] the planet Earth to get access to the
[53:31] world's information. That's how I think
[53:33] about what we're building here is
[53:34] everyone can get access to spot bitcoin
[53:36] in a fault tolerant and redundant way.
[53:38] How how do you make a so like uh right
[53:41] now you have to do a video verification
[53:43] when you make an transaction then yeah
[53:45] there's multiple with multiple different
[53:47] entities so the way it's constructed is
[53:49] when you're onboard and it takes a few
[53:51] minutes you have a direct legal
[53:52] relationship with on-ramp direct legal
[53:54] relationship with bitco and then our
[53:55] recovery partner we have multiple
[53:57] institutions so you don't have to have
[53:58] on-ramp holding a key if you don't uh is
[54:00] coin cover your two parties or your um
[54:04] what we call active signers is when you
[54:06] go to do a withdrawal you're going to
[54:08] book time with an on-ramp operation
[54:10] specialist. They're going to go through
[54:11] and it's a dynamic conversation. It's
[54:13] quick, but it's dynamic. Meaning, you're
[54:14] going to ask, you know, the time, the
[54:15] date, address, a bunch of information
[54:17] that can't be actually deep baked. Then
[54:20] ultimately, once that's completed,
[54:22] you're going to go to a second
[54:23] independent institution. This is where
[54:25] the real magic happens is because you
[54:27] have a different entity in a different
[54:28] place and different location with
[54:30] different responsibilities. And Bitco is
[54:32] one of the best in the business. They
[54:33] hold over hundred billion dollars in
[54:35] assets. they mess something up, that's
[54:37] on them, right? That's their whole
[54:38] business model. And what's exciting
[54:40] about all this is we added actually
[54:41] Lloyds of London up to $100 million
[54:43] policy on incidents as well, which is
[54:45] really exciting because that really
[54:46] hadn't been done. Insurance hadn't
[54:48] really been done correctly in the
[54:49] Bitcoin space. I can talk to you about
[54:50] that if you want, but um it actually
[54:52] adds additional assurances from the
[54:55] common thing that come up came up was
[54:56] like collusion because most people's
[54:58] mental model when you think about
[54:59] multisig is like everyone's holding
[55:01] these devices. So me and Belshi have
[55:03] this device and we both click it if we
[55:05] want to collude and then we just take
[55:06] people's assets. It's like that's just
[55:08] not how it works. Institutional grade
[55:09] custody. You can't call Brian Armstrong
[55:11] and say like, "Hey, I want to move all
[55:13] of like Bitwise's ETF." Like it doesn't
[55:15] work like that. Even if you kidnapped
[55:16] him, he can't do it. There's controls in
[55:18] place. And so, um, that's how this all
[55:21] works is there's institutional grade
[55:22] controls at each independent institution
[55:25] and there's the video verification that
[55:27] just starts the process and then there's
[55:28] still all the controls in the background
[55:30] before a key ceremony takes place. Do
[55:32] you have something like um where you can
[55:36] see where where the Bitcoin is, like
[55:38] proof of reserve or something like that?
[55:41] So, I'm glad you brought that up because
[55:42] that is inherent to multi-institution
[55:45] custody. So proof of reserves in my mind
[55:47] is almost like a fallacy or window
[55:49] dressing because you can prove anybody's
[55:51] reserves. Let's forget about the
[55:52] liabilities aspect. If you have a
[55:54] central custodian that's doing proof of
[55:56] reserves and the next day they're hacked
[55:58] or their employees go rogue. Well, what
[56:00] matter what did it matter if the proof
[56:02] of reserves was there because it was
[56:03] there one day there not there the next?
[56:06] Inherent to multi-institution is every
[56:08] wallet is segregated. every independent
[56:11] we work with pensions, endowments,
[56:13] family offices, and the m majority of
[56:14] our client bases, people like me and
[56:16] you. Every wallet is verifiable. It's
[56:19] onchain and then at the end of the day,
[56:21] it's inherently proof reserves because
[56:23] you have the title of the Bitcoin and
[56:25] it's right there in your segregated
[56:27] wallet. Interesting. I love that. And in
[56:31] the the the one thing I always uh say pe
[56:34] people with self custody I love that
[56:36] there are already because we're so early
[56:39] already so many different options and
[56:42] I'm just looking forward to like how
[56:44] many different options will we have in
[56:46] like 10 15 years I'm because you you
[56:49] brought also the point up earlier like
[56:50] we we have no clue what what the the
[56:52] greatest entrepreneurs are still coming
[56:54] in there the the the greatest people
[56:56] will will still come in in in people in
[56:58] in Bitcoin We will build all those
[57:00] things. But I already feel like we have
[57:03] now so many different interesting and
[57:06] great solutions ranging from all sorts
[57:09] of angles when we have uh things like
[57:13] on-ramp. We have uh collaborative
[57:15] custochchain cars and all those things.
[57:18] Uh and then we have like of course the
[57:19] hardware wallets but also like things
[57:21] like bit uh how is it called the the the
[57:24] from those bit key or something like
[57:26] that. Um so there's already so many
[57:28] different solutions out there for so
[57:30] many different use cases. Um for for you
[57:33] is is like most of your customers you
[57:36] said is like individuals uh so not not
[57:38] corporations like most most of your
[57:40] customers are actually in individuals.
[57:43] Yeah. In May well there's two parts. One
[57:46] is we don't have to go deep in there,
[57:47] but I think that in 15 years we'll look
[57:50] back at the way we custody Bitcoin today
[57:52] and and be shocked because if you go 15
[57:55] years from now and Bitcoin is 1 to10
[57:57] million, we'll be shocked that we let
[57:59] Coinbase hold that amount of money and
[58:01] we'll also be shocked that we held that
[58:02] amount of money in a single hardware
[58:04] device or in a multisig because the
[58:07] reality is people break into people's
[58:09] homes all day long for Rolex watches and
[58:11] small, you know, things under $50,000.
[58:14] Once the bad actors realize that this
[58:16] stuff was in our house and we were
[58:17] self-custodying it, like the market's
[58:19] going to recognize, wait, that that's
[58:21] crazy. That's not how I want it done.
[58:23] And so in 15 years, we'll look back at
[58:25] the existing models. Um, and they won't
[58:28] make sense. Uh, now to your point about
[58:31] the client base, River has a really
[58:33] excellent chart. I could pull it up if
[58:35] you'd like, but ultimately it shows the
[58:37] um the ownership structure of Bitcoin.
[58:40] And it's something that most people
[58:42] don't really perceive because you hear
[58:43] about institutions coming in and then
[58:45] you also hear about you know Wall Street
[58:47] and and generally big fi uh stratified
[58:51] dictates you know products and services.
[58:54] 70% of all the bitcoin sits with
[58:56] individuals right so that's makes sense
[58:59] like that's our largest client base
[59:00] because that's who holds material wealth
[59:02] and needs better bitcoin custody. Um but
[59:04] then to your point we work with the
[59:06] first UK pensions that adopted Bitcoin.
[59:08] Uh we have endowments that we just
[59:10] onboarded, family offices and
[59:12] corporates, businesses. Um but then
[59:14] again that's like 30% of our business
[59:16] and then the other 70% is the individual
[59:19] because that's who holds the vast
[59:21] majority of the underlying asset.
[59:23] Absolutely interesting. Yeah. It's like
[59:25] mo most people don't especially outside
[59:28] of uh of of Bitcoin. I like oh like so
[59:31] many corporations own Bitcoin or like
[59:33] big players own Bitcoin. Then you look
[59:35] at the numbers like know individuals uh
[59:38] plebs uh on on the most bitcoin. Yeah.
[59:42] And this is this will be fun for you to
[59:44] think about with your guest and just
[59:46] opportunities is it's something that
[59:49] like I stumbled on about two months ago
[59:51] realizing because the individual holds
[59:54] the vast majority of Bitcoin. They've
[59:56] had the longest time in the market right
[59:58] to understand it. That's how they come
[59:59] to develop real material positions to
[60:01] being an all-in and by that nature alone
[60:04] that means they are the most
[60:06] sophisticated right and that's why they
[60:08] had to sever the internet connection and
[60:11] now it's changed because the price
[60:12] appreciated multi-institution comes in
[60:14] we work with the most sophisticated
[60:15] people whether it's on or early writers
[60:16] whoever's listening to this that wants
[60:18] to reach out I would encourage you to
[60:19] because it's a natural heristic or
[60:21] mechanism because it's just people that
[60:23] had to go through all this journey and
[60:24] they hear this and like oh my god this
[60:25] makes complete sense but why I'm
[60:28] bringing it up is
[60:29] because those
[60:31] individuals would never buy an ETF and
[60:35] they definitely would not go and buy a
[60:36] corporate whatever we talked about in
[60:38] the beginning that's being built because
[60:39] they understand the risk implied in
[60:42] that. And so why I'm sharing this is
[60:45] because those
[60:47] individuals are going to be the people
[60:48] that are building the net new products
[60:50] that deliver the most value to the world
[60:51] that will win long term. I look at it as
[60:54] a positive sum game versus zero sum
[60:56] because they're going to use the
[60:57] products and services that are credo to
[60:59] them deliver value and by nature if they
[61:01] build other things like that they're for
[61:03] everyone and so what you see in the
[61:06] traditional markets today it's basically
[61:08] taking advantage of the naive of people
[61:10] that haven't got there yet and so
[61:11] they're just looking for exposure into
[61:14] this ecosystem but then everyone knows
[61:15] once you buy it on the cash app or Robin
[61:17] Hood you realize you can't take delivery
[61:18] you eventually smarten up and you're
[61:20] like why was I in this and you're hoping
[61:22] to god had before that first exposure
[61:24] and you wondering you didn't get
[61:26] rugged, right? Because like a lot of
[61:28] people learned on BlockFi and FTX and so
[61:31] that kind of rounds out coming back full
[61:33] circle of like no sophisticated
[61:35] individual is going into an ETF because
[61:37] of the counterparty risk and the
[61:38] multiple layers of it in the same way
[61:40] nobody's going into a micro strategy if
[61:41] they really understand it because you
[61:42] have all this risk but we just assume oh
[61:45] it's okay for the net new incomers
[61:47] versus saying no we should just build
[61:48] better products and services from the
[61:50] start for everyone. Uh, and I think
[61:52] maybe that's at the essence of where I
[61:54] have the aversion to a lot of the
[61:56] security rappers around. It's a it's a
[61:58] great point. Yeah. It's like when I look
[62:00] at the mistakes I've done in the past,
[62:04] it's almost like how did I not lose all
[62:07] my Bitcoin till now? Yeah. I made so
[62:09] many mistakes that I've now known. Um,
[62:12] they were like, okay, I was really lucky
[62:15] to uh I've lost Bitcoin along the way
[62:18] even though I'm I'm not that long into
[62:20] Bitcoin. Uh, but I've still lost some,
[62:22] but I've never lost a material amount of
[62:24] it. So, it it's almost like I I was
[62:27] lucky honestly.
[62:29] And that and that's like if you I'm glad
[62:32] you brought that up because that is
[62:33] embedded why Bitcoin is only 100K and
[62:36] not a million dollars a coin because
[62:39] it's easy to buy Bitcoin. It's hard to
[62:41] hold it long term. And that's embedded
[62:43] in everybody's decision when they when
[62:45] you go and pitch. This is something that
[62:47] never gets talked about, but when we
[62:48] talk to our friends and family and we
[62:50] say Bitcoin, they think crypto Ponzi and
[62:54] it ends up in a North uh Korean's
[62:56] hacker's wallet or it ends up in a UK
[62:58] landfill in a zip drive. And because
[63:01] it's always seems like it's fleeting and
[63:03] it's evaporating. And so that's where we
[63:05] reference like um that the browser
[63:09] moment in 95 democratize access
[63:11] multi-institution democratizes access
[63:13] for everyone to get material exposure
[63:14] because we work with OGs all the way to
[63:16] net new people coming into the space.
[63:18] They don't have to go through all the
[63:21] losses, all the risk, all the
[63:22] counterparty risk and be lucky. They
[63:25] just find the signal. And this is a good
[63:27] example where I talked to a client that
[63:29] went fast down the rabbit hole. Um,
[63:31] we'll probably have him on the pod, but
[63:32] I won't share his name just in case he
[63:34] doesn't want it to be known. Um, but
[63:36] point being is he when he first got in,
[63:38] he was like at Robin Hood at a tenth of
[63:41] a Bitcoin and then uh eventually uh, you
[63:45] know, went over to River because he
[63:46] heard River was great. River is great.
[63:47] Love River, but then realized but he
[63:50] still was at under a tenth of Bitcoin.
[63:51] Found us because he got introduced via
[63:53] mutual friend and we talked about
[63:54] custody and then he started building
[63:56] more of material exposure. now he's
[63:58] running like funds in the uh oil and gas
[64:01] energy related to Bitcoin. But where
[64:03] this ties into all this four or five
[64:04] months later he's all in Bitcoin and we
[64:07] talked yesterday and he's like man this
[64:08] Coinbase stuff happened and all these
[64:10] things are coming out. is like I was
[64:12] just so grateful I was a client of yours
[64:13] and I didn't have to worry I like I had
[64:15] to focus on my business and not worry
[64:18] about all the data and if my wife's you
[64:20] know uh at risk and all these things
[64:22] associated and that's like how it should
[64:24] be but we're still so early that the
[64:27] first risk of anybody getting exposure
[64:29] is is it going to evaporate tomorrow is
[64:31] it going to be completely gone and so it
[64:32] makes complete sense that most people
[64:34] don't allocate because I like to joke
[64:35] and say people would rather take you
[64:38] know negative yielding bonds or equities
[64:41] from a real rate of return over the 10
[64:44] years or the rest of their life versus
[64:46] having all their money evaporate the
[64:48] next day. It's just a logical pragmatic
[64:49] thing, right? Like I'd rather just lose
[64:51] all my money, get to base over 40 years
[64:52] versus buy Bitcoin and tomorrow because
[64:54] my collaborative custody, you know, I
[64:56] couldn't reconstitute it, they went away
[64:58] or the exchange blew up or it was
[65:00] rehypothecated or micro strategy. So
[65:02] like this is foundational to why the
[65:04] price is what it is and why people think
[65:06] this is all a Ponzi. Um and so it'll
[65:08] just take time and education. Very very
[65:11] true there. It's really interesting also
[65:13] to think about that. Um we have one
[65:14] question that I ask each and every one
[65:16] of my guests and the question is what
[65:18] can we learn from you besides Bitcoin?
[65:20] Man that's a good question.
[65:23] Uh I think I think the value um I think
[65:27] there's like the entrepreneurial aspect
[65:29] but really just delivering value
[65:32] like I think following I think what what
[65:35] happened with the traditional world
[65:36] because it's a little inorganic in who
[65:38] delivers value and who the king makers
[65:40] or rain makers historically have been
[65:43] that a lot of people have the right
[65:45] instincts and ideas but they're a little
[65:48] afraid to bring them up or or do them
[65:50] because everyone that's kind of in power
[65:52] has the ability to shoot them down
[65:54] shouldn't be in that position and so you
[65:56] ultimately end up with a lot of people
[65:58] believing that they can't do more than
[65:59] they can and once you wake up that it's
[66:03] like the old Steve Jobs quote was like
[66:04] you can just like you know poke the
[66:05] world and push through it or whatever
[66:07] it's like you can just change things and
[66:09] this was big for me in 22 because again
[66:11] this is outside of Bitcoin but after
[66:13] everyone blew up the FTXs the BlockFi
[66:16] the Celsius they realized oh my god the
[66:17] Genesis like even Gemini right cuz
[66:19] Gemini didn't blow up but they put their
[66:21] clients in bad assets even though they
[66:22] were the trusted party of of choice is
[66:26] that these people have no idea what
[66:27] they're doing, right? Like they just
[66:29] fundamentally don't. And so I think
[66:31] that's a big takeaway is that the world
[66:33] really doesn't have that creative an
[66:35] idea of what they're doing in the
[66:36] traditional sense. Now once you come
[66:38] into Bitcoin, everything you look at
[66:39] look at it from first principles and you
[66:41] can start to see where there's gaps, but
[66:42] there's not a big incentive to either
[66:44] talk about it or to feel like you can
[66:46] change it. And a theme I've I've shared
[66:48] a lot is like in the real world, if you
[66:50] have a good idea, it's probably not like
[66:51] the best idea because somebody's already
[66:53] tried it. But in Bitcoin, if anybody has
[66:55] a great or good idea or great idea, it's
[66:57] probably an amazing idea. It just hasn't
[66:59] been done yet because we're still so
[67:01] early. So that would be the
[67:02] encouragement that if you have any kind
[67:03] of idea or feeling where things aren't
[67:05] right to really either speak up or act
[67:07] on them because the second thing you do,
[67:09] the world has a really fun way of if
[67:11] you're providing value to the world, it
[67:13] just delivers 10 to 100x more. But
[67:15] nobody's I think we all forgot about
[67:17] that because we've been living in kind
[67:18] of the in a again just a world with
[67:21] inorganic uh cost of capital and who
[67:23] gets to move it around and so you don't
[67:24] get to hear that. That's a that's a
[67:26] great point. I like that. It's really
[67:29] exciting to when I talk with you to
[67:31] think about what what uh Bitcoiners will
[67:34] build in Bitcoin and outside of Bitcoin
[67:36] with with so much uh capital at hand.
[67:38] Um, really cool. We have an endine in in
[67:40] the podcast where the previous guest is
[67:42] asking a question for the next guest
[67:43] without knowing who the next guest
[67:44] actually is and the previous guest asks
[67:46] you the question. When are you doing
[67:48] when you are doing your best? What do
[67:50] you notice that is one habit that you
[67:52] are doing to get to that best version of
[67:55] yourself? Generally doing the thing
[67:56] that's like uh the hardest or uh that
[67:59] you don't want to
[68:00] do, you know. So like it goes back
[68:03] to hard choices, easy life, easy
[68:06] choices, hard life, right? Um, a good
[68:09] example of this was, you know, when we
[68:11] stumbled, we talk about a lot of these
[68:13] concepts. These concepts may sound
[68:14] theoretical, um, but they're all built
[68:16] in in deep practice and blood, sweat,
[68:18] and tears. You had to do things the
[68:20] wrong way. You know, a lot of things
[68:21] went wrong. And, um, the example is uh,
[68:24] building on-ramp. you just seen the
[68:26] amount of liquidity into companies
[68:28] whether it's in the Bitcoin company
[68:29] space or the wei work example is all
[68:32] this liquidity drowns out all soundness
[68:34] all sound unit economics all business
[68:36] decision ideas because once you bring in
[68:39] that amount of money like just imagine
[68:40] me and you if we raise $10 million or
[68:43] like we can just say a million if we
[68:44] start a business in one universe with a
[68:46] million in fiat and a million in BTC we
[68:48] are going to run laps around the individ
[68:51] our version of the dollars and so I made
[68:54] this hard choice when we started on ramp
[68:55] is like I think this was a very big
[68:57] idea. Didn't want to see it get ruined.
[68:59] So didn't go and take external capital.
[69:01] Spent my own money. But that like sounds
[69:02] crazy, right? Because you know your
[69:04] Bitcoin's price appreciation. This is in
[69:06] a bare market. But it turned out to be
[69:07] the best decision I could have ever
[69:09] made. Not only for on-ramp and how we
[69:10] built the business, but also where early
[69:12] riders stem from. And then you get to
[69:14] like, you know, you get to get the reap
[69:16] those rewards. But it's not easy because
[69:18] the easy thing to do is to take the
[69:20] money. It's the same angle of like if
[69:22] you want to get in shape, you don't go
[69:23] to the buffet. But it's hard to not go
[69:24] to the buffet because it's like it's
[69:26] free food and there's a lot of it. Um
[69:30] hopefully that kind of
[69:33] you have to like it it's so many people
[69:37] want to have like an or just like be in
[69:39] shape but the easy but the hard choice
[69:42] is yeah you have to work out and you
[69:44] have to eat nice and then you do all
[69:46] those hard things and this is what what
[69:48] what brings then uh the best version out
[69:51] of yourself. Thank you so much uh
