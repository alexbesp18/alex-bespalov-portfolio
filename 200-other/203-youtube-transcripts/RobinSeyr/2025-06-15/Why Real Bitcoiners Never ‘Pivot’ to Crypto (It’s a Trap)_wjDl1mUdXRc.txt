[00:00] It's easier than you'd think when you're
[00:02] a Bitcoiner. If I weren't doing Bitcoin,
[00:04] I wouldn't, you know, the next thing on
[00:05] the list isn't crypto. That would be,
[00:08] you know, number 78 on the list. And so
[00:10] many OGs, I think, have already dumped
[00:13] the portions of their stacks that they
[00:14] wanted to, having negotiated with their
[00:17] wives, you know, 4 years ago or 8 years
[00:19] ago that they promised to peel some off
[00:21] and buy a house finally or it's sad how
[00:23] many people who love Bitcoin end up
[00:26] working in crypto cuz it feels close and
[00:28] similar when they really could be doing
[00:30] something much better for the world,
[00:31] make a lot more money than they spend
[00:33] and stack Bitcoin, which obviously helps
[00:35] everybody. And then obviously on the
[00:37] number go up side of things. I mean this
[00:38] is the cycle of the corporates. I think
[00:40] that's where all the noise is. I started
[00:42] a company called Swan. We're really
[00:44] focused on providing financial services
[00:47] for Bitcoin investors and just helping
[00:49] people get into Bitcoin. We pay a bunch
[00:51] of contractors and vendors in Bitcoin
[00:52] because they're orange pill and they
[00:54] want Bitcoin and we can send it to them
[00:55] because we have Bitcoin. That's a great
[00:57] use for it. You know, trying to pay in
[00:59] Bitcoin for some fiat receivable from
[01:01] some company that's not orange peel.
[01:02] It's like why? What's the point?
[01:07] Hi Corey, how are you doing? Everything
[01:09] fine on your end? Good, Robin. Thank you
[01:11] so much for having me on and uh great to
[01:13] finally meet you. Absolutely. Um maybe
[01:16] for the I mean you're well known in the
[01:18] Bitcoin community, but maybe for the few
[01:20] people that might not know you or might
[01:22] have not seen you. Um who are you and
[01:24] and why you're excited about uh Bitcoin?
[01:27] Yeah. Well, hello everyone. Nice to meet
[01:29] you. My name is Corey Clipston and I am
[01:31] a Bitcoiner and uh I started a company
[01:34] called Swan uh 6 years ago in 2019 and
[01:38] uh we're really focused on providing
[01:40] financial services for Bitcoin investors
[01:43] and just helping people get into
[01:44] Bitcoin, helping them manage their
[01:46] stack, helping them uh not get wrecked,
[01:49] etc. So, a lot of custody options, uh,
[01:52] asset management options, obviously,
[01:55] like savings
[01:56] plans, retirement accounts in the United
[01:59] States. Uh, and excitingly, and one of
[02:01] the reasons that I wanted to to do this
[02:03] show with you is uh we'll be back in uh
[02:06] about 40 countries outside the USA for
[02:08] the first time in four years uh later
[02:10] this month of May. So, that's really
[02:12] exciting. So you'll be able to check out
[02:15] uh Swan and see uh which countries we
[02:17] serve and hopefully yours will be on it.
[02:20] You you're you're expanding to like also
[02:22] you all the European countries now. Not
[02:24] all but a lot of them. Yeah. With the
[02:27] Michael license probably like then all
[02:29] if you get it right. Yeah. It's
[02:31] basically you Yeah. If we do if we do
[02:34] Mika at some point then we would have
[02:36] all of them substantially. But uh this
[02:38] is under the reverse solicitation rules
[02:40] that pretty much all these countries
[02:42] have where if the customers come to us
[02:45] then we can serve them but we can't
[02:46] advertise in the local market and can't
[02:48] advertise in the local language. Really
[02:51] really cool. First of all, I I really
[02:53] want to start with uh saying thank you
[02:55] because you and and some other voices
[02:57] when I first came into Bitcoin in 2020,
[03:00] 2021, 2022, like my orange building
[03:03] years um kind of really made clear it's
[03:06] Bitcoin only. And I really also um like
[03:10] that you stayed with the business model
[03:13] with with Bitcoin only because I know
[03:15] it's really tempting to to get in this
[03:17] shitcoin casino, make uh maybe more
[03:19] money or like raise more money. Um, so I
[03:22] think it's it's it's really cool that
[03:24] you have stayed true to to Bitcoin only
[03:26] and and just like stick with that and I
[03:29] think it's a hard stand to take. I I
[03:30] cannot imagine but like investors are
[03:33] like, "Hey, why are you not doing the
[03:34] other things and getting pressure from
[03:36] that?" It's it's easier than you'd think
[03:39] when you're a Bitcoiner. Uh because if I
[03:42] weren't doing Bitcoin, I wouldn't, you
[03:44] know, the next thing on the list isn't
[03:45] crypto. That would be, you know, number
[03:47] 78 on the list. I would I would go back
[03:49] into startups and build a SAS company or
[03:52] I'd do a media company or I'd go back
[03:54] into consulting or work for Google again
[03:56] or something like that, you know, or
[03:58] just start another company. Uh I have
[04:00] tons of startup ideas outside of Bitcoin
[04:02] if I completely failed and couldn't do
[04:05] Bitcoin. I would I would do something
[04:07] else. I would never get into crypto. So,
[04:10] I like that. It's really good. I I think
[04:12] that's it's sad how many people who love
[04:15] Bitcoin uh end up working in crypto
[04:18] because it feels close and similar um
[04:21] when they really could be doing
[04:22] something much better for the world and
[04:25] uh and could still make a lot more money
[04:27] than they spend and stack Bitcoin which
[04:30] obviously helps everybody. Yeah, it's
[04:32] the it's the it's a good thing to do.
[04:34] Yeah, it's not it's not Bitcoin or
[04:36] crypto. It's Bitcoin not crypto.
[04:40] I love that. Um, what makes you excited
[04:44] about Bitcoin in this cycle? What have
[04:45] you seen in in in the in the in the bull
[04:48] market this this this cycle? Look, I I
[04:51] look at it as kind of two prompts. You
[04:52] know, there's kind of the the
[04:54] engineering and protocol development and
[04:56] things going on with with layers. So,
[04:59] you know, there's there's exciting
[05:01] explosion of advancements on Lightning
[05:02] and then, you know, I'm pretty close to
[05:04] the the ARC project and helping out
[05:06] Tiier and and Arc Labs a little bit and
[05:09] uh really bullish on what that does both
[05:12] uh on its own, but then also enhancing
[05:14] Lightning. So, that's pretty cool. And
[05:16] then obviously on the number go up side
[05:18] of things, I mean, this is the cycle of
[05:20] the corporates. I think that's where all
[05:21] the noise is. And you know, I'm we're
[05:24] we're shooting now on pizza day, isn't
[05:25] it? Pizza day, May 22nd. Yeah. Yeah.
[05:28] Yeah, it's a pizza day today. Um, and
[05:30] yesterday, uh, you know, yesterday,
[05:33] yesterday over in Japan, there was a
[05:35] short squeeze on Met Planet that just
[05:37] looked
[05:38] insane. It was like GameStop level
[05:41] hilarity over there um, with them
[05:44] gapping up yesterday. And then, you
[05:46] know, there's the the Tether Spa with
[05:48] uh, with Jack Mer's, you know, that's
[05:49] going to plow a bunch of money in
[05:51] through Caner and Soft Bank uh, and do
[05:53] kind of a Micro Strategy clone. And then
[05:55] there's the the David Bailey Bitcoin
[05:57] Magazine one uh Nakamoto with uh with
[06:00] Jihon and uh and Bology and all those
[06:03] guys uh trying to buy a bunch of
[06:04] Bitcoin. So, you know, it'll be uh it'll
[06:08] be interesting to see these plays out
[06:09] play out. And there's probably another
[06:10] 10 in the works right now of just, you
[06:12] know, hedge funds pulling together a
[06:15] couple billion dollars and looking for
[06:17] somebody to be the operator and the
[06:18] promoter. And so, I I don't think this
[06:20] theme has played out at all. Um I think
[06:23] it will
[06:24] be the the primary factor leading to a a
[06:30] larger rise in price in the near term
[06:33] and also uh that eventual cycle high
[06:36] being sooner. So that's my kind of
[06:38] calculus since you know the last couple
[06:41] of weeks of a lot more announcements and
[06:43] a lot more of these Bitcoin accumulation
[06:45] public
[06:46] vehicles starting is that we'll be going
[06:50] higher and it will be sooner which also
[06:52] means that a crash will come sooner and
[06:54] it will be worse.
[06:57] Interesting. It's also interesting uh
[06:59] it's like if you look at Google trends
[07:01] and all all those things it seems like
[07:03] institutional adoption is is the one
[07:05] that that drives everything right now
[07:07] and and retail is is kind of sleeping on
[07:10] it. I was always I was also really
[07:12] disappointed by how many like how nobody
[07:16] cares outside of Bitcoin about the 100k
[07:18] and and what's going on in Bitcoin. I
[07:20] thought number technology is is
[07:22] something that retail excites about but
[07:24] not even this is really exciting for
[07:25] them. Yeah. checking my I I have a block
[07:28] rocket, not a block clock, uh behind me.
[07:31] Uh it's really cool, but uh it's not in
[07:33] the camera right now, but um yeah, we're
[07:36] at 111. And uh yeah, it does it does
[07:39] feel a lot different. This rise from 74,
[07:43] 73 or whatever we got down to and then
[07:45] back through 100K finally and up to 110,
[07:48] 111. This definitely feels a lot
[07:50] different and a lot more real than all
[07:52] the attempts to take 100k before. Uh and
[07:55] so yeah, I think the bull market uh has
[07:59] begun as of
[08:02] yesterday. May 21st was the the day the
[08:05] bull market began. Um and yeah, we'll
[08:07] see what happens. There's nothing but
[08:09] air above and there's no price memory
[08:11] and there's no natural kind of sell
[08:13] walls other than round numbers. You
[08:14] know, you'll have a little bounce back
[08:16] at 120, 130, 140, 150, whatever. But I
[08:19] think uh you know there there aren't
[08:21] natural sellers when we get into these
[08:23] areas.
[08:25] And so many OGs, I think, have already
[08:28] dumped the portions of their stacks that
[08:30] they wanted to around kind of the
[08:32] psychological, you know, six figures,
[08:35] you know, having negotiated with their
[08:37] wives, you know, four years ago or eight
[08:39] years ago that they promised to peel
[08:41] some off and buy a house finally or, you
[08:43] know, upgrade the 1986 Datson to
[08:46] something like a 2015 Camry or something
[08:49] like that. they peel off some coins
[08:52] around 100k and I think that's what
[08:54] happened for six months and and now that
[08:56] selling seems to be mostly gone. It's
[08:59] interesting. as like the the the the
[09:02] milestones of 100k is also like you if
[09:05] you are in Bitcoin since like I don't
[09:07] know like 2,000 3,000 5,000 at some
[09:10] point you're like okay maybe you you
[09:12] only earn a little bit but you saved a
[09:14] lot and then it's like hey I I want to
[09:16] peel off a little bit to maybe up my
[09:19] standard or something like it's
[09:20] understandable and understandable I
[09:22] think it's human um even though it it it
[09:25] probably will be a bad financial
[09:27] decision long term but maybe it's a good
[09:28] emotional decision
[09:30] you know, yeah,
[09:32] that's you. We have lives and we have
[09:35] families and you only live once. And you
[09:38] know, if you if you haven't visited Rome
[09:40] and Istanbul and Barcelona and London
[09:42] and Vienna in your life, like take the
[09:45] trip at some point. You got to
[09:47] otherwise, you know, what is this all
[09:48] for? Um, and I think that's where a lot
[09:50] of people kind of get to once they've
[09:53] held for a long, long time, you know.
[09:56] So, I'm never going to lambast anybody
[09:58] that holds for 10 years and, you know,
[10:01] appreciates through two cycles and, you
[10:03] know, goes up two orders of magnitude in
[10:05] their stack value or something like that
[10:07] from peeling off some coins and living
[10:08] life a little bit. How do you actually
[10:10] look at um uh selling Bitcoin versus
[10:14] let's say you have to like buy a new car
[10:15] because you old broke down and and you
[10:17] you you you either have to sell Bitcoin
[10:19] because you're already all in or you can
[10:21] borrow against it. How do you look at
[10:23] that topic?
[10:24] Uh, I mean, if you have if you have cash
[10:27] flow coming in because you have a job
[10:29] and you know you can cover interest
[10:31] payments and that you can pay back the
[10:32] fiat loan, you know, without having to
[10:34] peel off Bitcoin later, or you just um,
[10:38] you know,
[10:39] you don't have to put up much of your
[10:41] stack for the asset back loan. And so
[10:44] then you can afford to wait it out and
[10:46] roll the loan, you know, two, three,
[10:48] four years or however long it takes for
[10:50] Bitcoin's keer and price appreciation to
[10:53] make it cheaper. Um, then it makes
[10:55] sense. But, you know, there's a reason
[10:57] that we don't make assetbacked loans
[10:59] available in the Swan interface. It's
[11:01] because we want to be able to talk to
[11:03] people. That's kind of the the point of
[11:05] Swan is that you actually get a private
[11:08] client adviser that you can actually
[11:10] speak to about these things. We also
[11:12] don't do small loans. Like somebody
[11:13] that's, you know, only looking to borrow
[11:16] 5K or 10K or something like that, you
[11:18] know, probably shouldn't be doing that.
[11:21] Um, in my view, like that's, you know,
[11:23] probably going to get you wrecked. Uh,
[11:25] most of these asset back loan products,
[11:27] it's the it's the lower end of the scale
[11:30] that's getting margin called cuz they
[11:32] wouldn't be borrowing the money unless
[11:34] they really really needed it. Um, so
[11:37] it's it's probably better to focus on
[11:38] topline and earnings rather than risking
[11:42] your stack if you don't actually have
[11:43] much of a stack. Um, I'm back on cells.
[11:47] Interestingly, we just added a sell
[11:49] button in the Swan app and website for
[11:53] the first time since inception. So, the
[11:55] first 5 years of Swan was no sell
[11:57] button. Uh, I think we've made our
[11:59] point. Uh, also we've had so many people
[12:02] that bought, you know, in the single
[12:03] digits, you know, single digit thousands
[12:05] and bought at 17, 18, 30, whatever it
[12:08] is. You know, they're just, you know,
[12:10] there's they've written it up and I
[12:12] don't think that we need to force them
[12:14] to get in touch with client service so
[12:16] we can convince them not to sell
[12:17] anymore. Uh, which is what we've done
[12:19] historically. You had to you had to call
[12:22] us and answer some questions before we
[12:24] allowed you to sell.
[12:26] It's almost like the reverse where uh
[12:28] when you try to transfer from the bank
[12:31] to to a Bitcoin exchange, the bank is
[12:34] asking like, "Do you really want to do
[12:35] that?" And now it's like the reverse of
[12:37] like, "Do you really want to go back the
[12:39] field?" Yeah. No, it's true. I we have
[12:41] this discussion with uh Yarn, our uh
[12:44] German UIUX guy, and uh we were always
[12:47] laughing about how many boxes do you
[12:49] have to close to be able to sell? Like,
[12:51] are you sure? Close. Are you really
[12:53] sure? Yes. You know, like maybe you move
[12:57] it around and it's really hard to click
[12:59] on an impossible capture. You know, like
[13:02] you have to click on the bridges or the
[13:03] traffic lights, but you know, you're
[13:05] always wrong. And then finally, you
[13:06] could sell. But no, we have a sell
[13:08] button now. I gave up without a a think
[13:13] time. So like you sell button, but you
[13:15] have to think about your decision 10
[13:17] days. Yes, that that's what we should
[13:19] do. Yeah, we should have like a slight
[13:21] delay or something. But I it's really
[13:24] interesting. I actually did not know
[13:25] that because uh in Austria I couldn't
[13:27] even um I think I couldn't even use uh
[13:29] Swan for for the longest time and and
[13:31] since the last six months I just earn in
[13:33] Bitcoin and and don't really have to buy
[13:35] it. But it's interesting to not have a
[13:38] sell button. I I wasn't aware that Swan
[13:40] does not have a sell button. I I always
[13:43] knew about Bitcoin only.
[13:44] How like was it because it's so if you
[13:48] if you build a Bitcoin exchange you're
[13:49] like okay like buy and sell like those
[13:51] are the the two options. So it was from
[13:52] the inception of like hey we don't want
[13:55] people exch we were never an exchange we
[13:57] don't have an order book. So we've
[14:00] always just been an accumulation
[14:01] platform and a financial services firm.
[14:03] So it's you know yes you buy Bitcoin and
[14:05] then you have uh retirement accounts you
[14:07] have custody. You have inheritance
[14:09] advice. We have things that are coming
[14:11] later this year like a Bitcoin rewards
[14:13] credit card and Bitcoin interest on
[14:14] dollar deposits. Uh we have Swan Vault,
[14:17] the two of three multi-IG product. Um
[14:20] you know, just kind of on and on. Entity
[14:22] accounts, business stacking, corporate
[14:24] treasury services. So it's it's really
[14:26] about being a broad-based, you know,
[14:28] Bitcoin based wealth platform or
[14:30] financial services firm, not an
[14:32] exchange. So, the type of client that we
[14:35] attract, obviously, with our Bitcoin
[14:37] only message and hold for the long term,
[14:39] not having a sell button was only ever
[14:43] uh weird or an issue for like less than
[14:46] 1% of our clients because none of them
[14:47] historically ever wanted to sell. So,
[14:50] it's really about our client base
[14:52] getting a little bit longer in the tooth
[14:53] and having gone through a couple of bull
[14:55] markets now or one and a half uh where
[14:58] you start to hear more requests for a
[15:00] sell button.
[15:03] Yeah, it's like then then you don't want
[15:04] to take advantage of that. But you had
[15:06] also not an exchange, right? Just like
[15:08] you know these these kind of you know
[15:11] Swan Unchained River Strike Fold like
[15:13] those are not exchanges. They're
[15:15] basically brokers.
[15:17] It's like an on and off off ramp uh like
[15:20] on ramp basically. It's really
[15:23] interesting. Um I'm I'm wondering
[15:25] because you're so long in in in the
[15:27] Bitcoin, you've learned a lot on
[15:29] Bitcoin. what is the kind of the biggest
[15:31] lessons you learned from Bitcoin outside
[15:32] of of Bitcoin really outside of of money
[15:35] and Namog knowledge and and about the
[15:37] the cycles?
[15:39] Uh so completely outside of Bitcoin I
[15:42] think because Bitcoin is so uh linked
[15:44] with energy and energy markets and
[15:47] energy production I think that's
[15:48] probably the the one area that I learned
[15:52] the most about probably that I that I
[15:55] wasn't into before. Uh I I was already
[15:59] very into economics, finance, investing,
[16:03] macro, economic history, monetary
[16:06] history, like all those kinds of things.
[16:07] You I went to University of Chicago,
[16:10] started there 23 years ago. So I kind of
[16:13] been around the montorists and the
[16:14] Austrians for a long time. Um but uh
[16:18] yeah, I think getting energy pill is uh
[16:22] something that happens to most
[16:24] Bitcoiners that that start to pay
[16:26] attention and see uh what's true and
[16:29] what's not true about what we've been
[16:30] told about energy markets and energy
[16:32] production. Yeah. The biggest thing is
[16:35] always like when when you listen to to
[16:37] them, you're like when you spend less
[16:39] energy, it's better than you when you
[16:41] spend more energy. And they're like, no,
[16:42] actually, is that really true? I don't
[16:44] think so. It's definitely not true.
[16:46] Yeah. It basically comes from, you know,
[16:48] false narratives around population bombs
[16:50] from the
[16:51] 70s, you know, and and thinking that we
[16:54] needed like a smaller energy footprint
[16:56] and people freaking about freaking out
[16:57] about peak oil. Uh but meanwhile, we've
[17:01] used more oil every year for the last 50
[17:03] years. And also every year for the last
[17:05] 50 years, we've had more proven
[17:07] reserves. So, as we use more oil, we're
[17:10] finding out that we have more oil
[17:12] because that's
[17:14] That's just the nature of the planet
[17:16] that we live on that as technology gets
[17:18] better and as technology gets cheaper
[17:20] over time because of going down the cost
[17:23] curve of production and and exploration
[17:25] we end up with more proven reserves as
[17:27] we go. That's why it was also
[17:30] frustrating. I mean now the the the
[17:32] environment FUD is almost gone like I I
[17:35] I don't hear it a lot but it it it took
[17:39] some time and it was like really
[17:40] annoying for like one two years. There
[17:42] it is. Yeah, it's it's we I I'm assuming
[17:46] you're kind of an upper millennial and
[17:48] I'm kind of like a young Gen X and uh
[17:50] you know, our entire lives have only
[17:52] been with the backdrop of climate
[17:55] freakout. But if you're a little bit
[17:56] older than us and you were born in the
[17:58] 60s or before, then you know, you saw 10
[18:02] years of global freezing
[18:05] FUD before the global warming FUD. So we
[18:09] were we were all going to freeze and the
[18:10] ice caps were going to come and cover
[18:12] everything in the 60s and 70s and that
[18:15] didn't happen, you know. So, you know,
[18:18] so I think some of those folks have a
[18:20] little bit more perspective because
[18:22] they've seen this go both ways and it's
[18:24] kind of a way to start lots of
[18:26] nonprofits where the people running the
[18:28] nonprofits profit plenty because their
[18:29] salaries are like a million dollars and
[18:31] you know they spend all of the donations
[18:33] on private jets and parties.
[18:36] I I'm I'm I'm actually Gen C still. Most
[18:40] most people are I'm I'm still
[18:42] Okay. Well, it's it's the it's like just
[18:44] a year. Healthy central European facial
[18:47] hair always confuses me.
[18:51] Um yeah, really cool. I I really want to
[18:53] uh get get your your take on on the
[18:55] things that kind of happened uh this
[18:57] cycle and and there's so much happening
[18:59] from like last year. I mean in in
[19:02] America I'm kind of envy honestly
[19:04] because in in America at least there's
[19:07] like Bitcoin talk on politics sides on
[19:09] on regulator side in European Union you
[19:13] if you hear something it's very negative
[19:14] and and you're lucky to hear
[19:16] anything about Bitcoin at all how has
[19:20] the political landscape for you uh
[19:22] changed in the the last coming years and
[19:24] how is how also Trump maybe impacted
[19:27] things on on your side?
[19:29] Yeah, I mean it's uh it's obviously been
[19:32] fascinating and it's uh it's a story of
[19:37] leaning into a demographic of of
[19:41] Bitcoiners, but also obviously all the
[19:43] money coming from the crypto folk trying
[19:45] to perform regulatory capture and and
[19:48] you know get a get out of jail free card
[19:50] uh by backing uh politicians. So, you
[19:53] know, it's it's it's reopened that
[19:56] battlefield that kind of ended to some
[19:59] degree with the launch of the ETFs and
[20:01] kind of the separation of Bitcoin from
[20:02] crypto after the crypto collapses in 22
[20:04] 23. uh you know that battlefield has
[20:07] kind of been reopened because uh you
[20:10] know crypto did not get regulated out of
[20:13] existence in the United States and it's
[20:15] very very strong and they own a bunch of
[20:17] representatives and a bunch of senators
[20:19] and the crypto folk basically own the
[20:21] White House and uh you know and Bitcoin
[20:24] is kind of along for the ride and it's
[20:25] the only thing that all these different
[20:26] crypto companies can agree on. Um and of
[20:30] course Bitcoin doesn't care because it
[20:32] doesn't have a management team and it
[20:33] doesn't have lobbyists. So it's kind of
[20:35] at the whim of very idiosyncratic
[20:38] relationships where we benefit from, you
[20:40] know, a few senators that actually
[20:42] understand Bitcoin deeply. They still
[20:44] sometimes have to make compromises with
[20:46] blockchain, crypto, DeFi people. Uh so
[20:49] that would be like a Cynthia Lumis or
[20:51] something like that where she's involved
[20:52] in crypto things, but is really like
[20:53] Bitcoin only and at least doesn't take
[20:56] money or do favors for the worst of the
[20:59] crypto actors. Uh, and then you also
[21:01] have, you know, Senator Cruz, for
[21:04] instance, who understands Bitcoin deeply
[21:07] and in a very principled way doesn't
[21:09] touch crypto at all. Um, and then you
[21:12] have a bunch of politicians that are
[21:14] just completely for sale and they will
[21:15] say whatever they need to to get the
[21:17] money to get a bunch of, you know,
[21:19] donations and then, uh, get reelected.
[21:22] And that's pretty much the rest of them.
[21:24] Um, and then you've got the Trumps, you
[21:26] know, just lining their pockets every
[21:28] which way that they can by taking promo
[21:31] money and $350 million of trading fees
[21:35] on Trumpcoin and, you know, a big mining
[21:37] company just giving them 20% of the
[21:39] company to be associated, things like
[21:41] that. So, it's just uh it's the most
[21:44] commercially-minded
[21:46] uh administration ever as far as the the
[21:49] administration itself and and the
[21:51] candidate and his family being uh in
[21:54] business and more than doubling their
[21:56] net worth since January, mostly through
[21:58] crypto is pretty unprecedented in in
[22:02] really all of world politics outside of
[22:04] tyrannies.
[22:06] Interesting. I have one observation. And
[22:09] I'm curious what what's your take on
[22:11] this till the ETF and especially now
[22:14] with with uh an more friendly
[22:17] administration against uh Bitcoin. um
[22:20] till this happened I was always
[22:23] concerned will we come peacefully or
[22:25] like a little bit more violent to to the
[22:27] Bitcoin um world or Bitcoin hyper
[22:30] bitcoinized world and since USA is now
[22:34] so uh friendly to bitcoin I those
[22:38] concerns are kind of washed away and I'm
[22:40] really thinking it it will be a peaceful
[22:43] revolution uh how did did this impact
[22:46] your feeling about peaceful non-
[22:47] peaceful yeah absolutely
[22:50] uh you know I think uh the original
[22:52] mission of Swan which I published in
[22:54] early 2020 was 10 million Bitcoiners and
[22:57] it was about having an intrigent
[22:59] minority of 3 or 4% of the population
[23:02] being ready to fight for Bitcoin in some
[23:04] way you know show up at a town hall or
[23:07] uh activate fundraising to go attack uh
[23:10] an anti- Bitcoin candidate things like
[23:12] that and you know we saw that right and
[23:14] that was kind of the the battle for a
[23:16] while there was you know Brad Sherman
[23:18] talking a lot of smack about Bitcoin and
[23:19] so, you know, I interviewed the
[23:22] candidates that were going to run
[23:23] against him and found one that would be
[23:24] pro Bitcoin and then she became a star
[23:27] and got got Dorsy behind her and all
[23:29] that kind of stuff and, you know,
[23:31] Sherman hasn't said anything contra
[23:32] Bitcoin ever since because it became
[23:34] obvious that that was not a good issue
[23:37] to run on. Uh, and then in 2022 kind of
[23:41] advanced my thinking and made it more
[23:43] overarching, which was when I published
[23:45] uh the race to avoid the war. And that's
[23:48] specifically what you're talking about,
[23:49] which is, you know, basically we're in a
[23:52] race to orange pill as much as society
[23:54] as possible
[23:56] before any kind of coordinated
[23:59] opposition that really could only the
[24:01] only entity on the planet that could
[24:03] actually make life difficult for Bitcoin
[24:05] and Bitcoiners is the US State
[24:06] Department. That's it. So, it's
[24:08] literally just that. And so if
[24:10] everything from legislative to judiciary
[24:13] to uh Wall Street and culture and
[24:17] investment firms all through the US and
[24:20] tons and tons of hodlers and
[24:23] 950,000 humans having a little bit of
[24:26] micro strategy at this point uh directly
[24:29] in their accounts plus another 55
[24:31] million I've heard that have exposure
[24:33] through funds and retirement pensions
[24:35] etc that they own a piece of that own
[24:37] Micro Strategy. you know, that kind of
[24:39] distribution and that that that gets
[24:42] enough people uh over the line to caring
[24:45] about Bitcoin and being aligned with
[24:47] number go up, frankly. Um but also as
[24:49] they go down the rabbit hole
[24:50] philosophically aligned and kind of
[24:52] understanding where this is going and
[24:53] how it's actually good for America, you
[24:58] know, we're in a really good spot here
[25:01] for the near term. So, the first order
[25:03] effect of the red wave and having a a a
[25:07] president that talks positively about
[25:09] Bitcoin um and does positive Bitcoin
[25:12] things through the family and friends or
[25:14] whatever uh is highly positive for
[25:16] Bitcoin. Uh so, it reduced the chance
[25:20] dramatically of something bad happening
[25:22] to Bitcoin and Bitcoiners in the near
[25:24] term. What we don't know is what happens
[25:27] later with a pendulum swing back and it
[25:31] basically the the concerns of lots of
[25:33] people who don't understand Bitcoin are
[25:35] not being listened to and just like this
[25:38] kind of Trump backlash against the Obama
[25:41] Biden years is has pushed the
[25:44] conversation and the Overton window and
[25:46] all kinds of things on social media and
[25:48] and and media at large to the right. We
[25:52] don't know what the backlash is going to
[25:53] be. So, you know, we're enjoying the
[25:55] salad days right now, but it's very
[25:57] unlikely that the Republicans win the
[25:59] House and the Senate next year in the
[26:01] midterms. Uh, it looks like the
[26:02] Democrats will probably pick up both.
[26:05] Um, and we don't know what's going to
[26:09] happen after that. And Bitcoin being so
[26:11] closely tied to crypto is probably going
[26:13] to end up being a massive mistake
[26:16] because nothing has changed from a
[26:18] legislative perspective. All that's
[26:20] changed is whether it's being enforced
[26:22] or not. So there is no clarity on crypto
[26:25] in the US and there's no further
[26:26] understanding of like the differences
[26:28] between Bitcoin and crypto and there
[26:30] could be a massive backlash specifically
[26:32] against all of the grift that we've seen
[26:35] in the crypto space you know really
[26:38] since November uh that could really drag
[26:41] things down and make it really really
[26:42] difficult. So I wouldn't celebrate yet.
[26:46] Um, I think the race that we're hoping
[26:49] we win, and I I talk to people about
[26:52] this a lot, is like, can we make enough
[26:54] progress, and I I hope that we do, that
[26:58] uh even when that backlash comes, which
[27:00] I think is inevitable, and we'll target
[27:02] Bitcoin and Bitcoiners a lot, uh, we
[27:04] will be so entrenched in number will be
[27:06] kind of so high and so many people will
[27:08] have an economic incentive to defend it
[27:11] that it won't matter. They'll they'll
[27:12] come too late. So that's that's my view
[27:15] on how things play out over the next few
[27:17] years. I think there'll be a huge
[27:18] backlash, but I'm really hopeful that we
[27:20] will have made enough progress to make
[27:22] that attack uh unsuccessful. Let's take
[27:24] a break for a moment and appreciate the
[27:27] beauty that Coin Vigilante has made with
[27:30] the Bitcoin watches. Those watches are
[27:33] the most amazing, the most elegant way
[27:36] of showing that you are a true
[27:38] Bitcoiner. and Coin Vigilante just
[27:41] dropped a completely new and amazing
[27:44] Genesis edition of their watch
[27:46] collections. You have the date of the
[27:49] first ever minded Bitcoin block in there
[27:52] and of course also the block height and
[27:54] which epoch we are currently in. I love
[27:58] the level of detail they put in in this
[28:01] masterpiece. Make sure to check out
[28:03] those amazing coin vigilante time pieces
[28:06] down in the descriptions. I love those
[28:08] watches so so much. And now if you have
[28:12] Bitcoin, I really do hope that you don't
[28:14] have it on exchange. But if you do have
[28:16] it on exchange, I have two ways for you
[28:18] to deal with that. The first way is you
[28:21] put it on a hardware wallet. That's the
[28:23] entry for you to get into the
[28:25] self-custody game. I recommend BitBox
[28:29] Bitcoin only edition for that. It's a
[28:31] super simple and secure way. And if you
[28:34] check out the link in the description,
[28:36] you even get 5% off if you use the code
[28:39] Robin. And the second way is the Bitcoin
[28:42] way. The Bitcoin way is your all-in
[28:45] partner in terms of how to get the most
[28:48] out of your sovereignty. They will
[28:51] personalize for you a self-custody setup
[28:54] that is perfect for your individual
[28:57] situation. They will show you how you
[28:59] can secure your own devices. Securing
[29:02] your Bitcoin is not enough. You also
[29:04] have to keep all your devices secure.
[29:06] One topic that is overlooked often is
[29:08] the inheritance plan. What happens with
[29:11] your Bitcoin once you are no longer
[29:14] here? Do you have a plan for that in
[29:17] place already? And last but not least,
[29:19] if you're in a jurisdictions where you
[29:21] don't feel safe, it's better to get a
[29:23] plan B for all that. Head over to the
[29:28] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[29:31] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[29:34] be for the first time ever speaking at
[29:36] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[29:39] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[29:42] really looking forward to seeing all of
[29:44] you there. You can get your ticket in
[29:46] the link down in the description of
[29:48] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[29:51] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[29:54] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[29:56] there. It's it's interesting. Yeah, this
[29:58] this connection to crypto is
[30:01] so like on a personal side annoying on
[30:06] an objective side just not true and and
[30:09] really something where I'm like how how
[30:12] can we get that and and I think it's
[30:14] it's getting better and better because
[30:16] even Trump said like either Bitcoin and
[30:19] crypto
[30:21] but so he always uses Bitcoin and
[30:23] crypto. like those two words. This is
[30:25] kind of like for me the first step
[30:27] towards the like having two different
[30:29] things there. Uh but it's still annoying
[30:32] that he talks about crypto land and
[30:35] crypto things and a lot of people do
[30:37] that and uh for me it's always a red
[30:39] flag if someone comes uh comes to me and
[30:41] like oh like I work in crypto I'm like
[30:43] oh
[30:44] uh that's that's that's immediately like
[30:46] a red flag or blockchain or web three or
[30:49] anything of those those keywords. So I
[30:52] think we have to still make a better job
[30:55] in explaining people why Bitcoin is
[30:57] absolutely not crypto. Yeah. Yeah. I
[31:00] mean it it continues. The work
[31:02] continues. Uh we we had about a year
[31:05] there where you know we were even
[31:06] considering uh turning off the daily
[31:09] tweet from the swan handle that just
[31:10] says Bitcoin not
[31:12] crypto. It's been running for a few
[31:14] years. Uh and uh yeah, it became very
[31:18] obvious uh earlier this year that we
[31:20] have to keep it running for probably
[31:22] another decade at least.
[31:25] Absolutely. Um what do you think? Um and
[31:28] Swan is doing um a great job in
[31:30] educating people and you're doing a
[31:32] great job in educating people. Is it
[31:33] like a um almost like an education first
[31:37] business for for what from what I see?
[31:40] Um what do you think will it will it
[31:42] take to orange build the next like
[31:44] billion people or two billion people
[31:46] whatever the number is um to really get
[31:48] the the masses in because we still I
[31:51] think extremely early extremely a small
[31:52] group of people that really actually
[31:54] understand Bitcoin.
[31:57] Look, I think it's just expanding
[31:59] concentric circles of more and more
[32:02] people, attaining a certain level of
[32:04] ability to explain and connect and kind
[32:07] of attach ideas that then start more and
[32:10] more people down the rabbit hole. Uh, no
[32:13] one voice is going to completely orange
[32:17] pill another person at some point. It
[32:19] always deep understanding always has to
[32:23] flip for the subject over to
[32:26] uh doing it yourself. You have to go
[32:29] down the rabbit hole yourself. You have
[32:30] to go through that, you know, 30 browser
[32:32] tabs
[32:34] open, six podcasts that you're
[32:36] following, you know, that that's that
[32:38] always has to happen at some point. Um
[32:41] you know, read three or four books,
[32:42] whatever it is before you fully kind of
[32:44] gro it. And you know, at some point you
[32:47] believe, but you don't yet understand.
[32:49] And so then you're looking to kind of
[32:51] confirm and buttress your belief and
[32:54] turn that into a rational understanding.
[32:56] And that's when you know that you are
[32:58] fully orange pill is when you are aware
[33:00] that other people think you're a
[33:02] believer but you know you're not. You
[33:04] know that you actually
[33:05] know like I know Bitcoin is rising in
[33:08] price over time. It's not a belief.
[33:12] It's a Yeah. Do you think AI has
[33:15] actually a positive impact on that
[33:17] because it it gets easy to get
[33:18] information or is it uh Yeah, it's it's
[33:21] definitely one of the tools for sure. uh
[33:23] it it varies in quality, but uh yeah, it
[33:26] does seem like Bitcoiners have done a
[33:28] nice job of uh providing enough on the
[33:30] internet to seed the LLMs to understand
[33:34] the difference between Bitcoin and
[33:35] crypto and understand Bitcoin's the
[33:37] fastest horse in the race and you know
[33:39] pretty pretty good descriptors
[33:41] uh in Grock and chat GBT and Gemini of
[33:45] uh what Bitcoin is and how it works and
[33:47] all those kinds of things. It's pretty
[33:48] effective. It's well done. Um yeah and I
[33:52] think you know if you go back
[33:54] to you know when we started out the the
[33:58] last cycle like there was it was very
[34:01] difficult to find information about just
[34:03] Bitcoin in
[34:05] 2017 there was you know almost nothing
[34:07] very few podcasts I think uh Laa and
[34:10] Marty started in 2018 Safe's book came
[34:13] out in 2018 Jan's book came out in 2019
[34:16] Linen Sailor didn't hit the scene until
[34:19] 2020 Um, you know, so it was just really
[34:22] different and you know, as you note like
[34:26] it was a mission uh to start an
[34:29] education focused Bitcoin financial
[34:31] services company. That was the plan from
[34:33] the beginning and it was education first
[34:35] and it was information and research
[34:37] first and that has a profit motive and
[34:40] rationale as well which is very well
[34:42] known in in startup land and tech land.
[34:44] It's just called, you know, contentled
[34:46] acquisition or content driven
[34:48] acquisition. And it just means, you
[34:50] know, reaching people through media and
[34:52] having them get in touch with you. It's
[34:53] like uh demand generation as opposed to
[34:56] running a bunch of ads on Facebook or
[34:58] Google. And I think it works in
[35:01] particular when your uh target audience
[35:04] is kind of niche and small and buried.
[35:06] Like you can't send direct mail to the
[35:08] rich people in a zip code asking them to
[35:10] buy Bitcoin. it won't be profitable
[35:13] because you'll get, you know, one or
[35:15] zero clients out of the 10,000 people
[35:16] that you mail to and that won't make up
[35:19] for the cost of the mailer. But if you
[35:21] run scaled media, then you can hit every
[35:25] neighborhood of 10,000 rich people on
[35:28] YouTube and Twitter and LinkedIn and
[35:30] newsletters and whatever or just, you
[35:32] know, having a lot of appearances on TV
[35:34] and then people get in touch with you.
[35:38] Yeah. Do do you think that Swan's role
[35:42] in in the Bitcoin ecosystem will will
[35:44] shift somehow in the next like five to
[35:46] to 10 years as as Bitcoin also involves?
[35:48] Well, it already has because the 27 to
[35:52] 2023
[35:54] era, the top of funnel for Bitcoin was
[35:57] shitcoins because it was hundred billion
[35:59] dollars of malinvestment from shitcoin
[36:03] VCs trying to promote a better
[36:05] Bitcoin and slagging Bitcoin, lying
[36:07] about Bitcoin, trying to wrap Bitcoin in
[36:10] the in the crypto flag or trying to wrap
[36:12] crypto in the Bitcoin flag. You know,
[36:14] these these were the the tools of the
[36:17] trade for Andreas and Horowits and
[36:19] Sequoia and of course all of the
[36:20] cryptonative VCs as well was to try to
[36:23] fool people. And the launch of the ETFs
[36:26] in January of 2024 completely changed
[36:28] the game because now the top of funnel
[36:31] for Bitcoin with the rise of Micro
[36:32] Strategy and these Treasury stocks as
[36:34] well, plus the ETFs, it's in people's
[36:36] brokerage account. And so they're
[36:39] getting Bitcoin education and you know
[36:41] what Black Rockck puts puts out is damn
[36:44] accurate. You know that team is run by a
[36:46] couple of Bitcoiners that started a
[36:48] blockchain group years ago even though
[36:50] they were Bitcoiners and they tried to
[36:51] steer the ship slowly and they
[36:53] succeeded. So and Abby the CEO of
[36:56] Fidelity has understood Bitcoin for more
[36:58] than a decade. So, you know, they uh
[37:01] they do a nice job and obviously Sailor
[37:03] is an incredible spokesperson for
[37:05] Bitcoin and understands he actually
[37:07] understands both S so ande
[37:10] uh very clearly. Uh he just stopped
[37:13] talking about for uh political
[37:16] and other reasons a couple years ago,
[37:18] but uh yeah, he he knows it's more than
[37:21] just a store of value as well.
[37:23] Um but
[37:25] uh so now the top of funnel for Bitcoin
[37:28] is Bitcoin, but it's it's something
[37:30] that's just uh price exposure in uh in a
[37:33] ticker in your brokerage account. And
[37:34] then once you get over half a percent or
[37:37] 1% of your net worth into Bitcoin, then
[37:39] that's when people want the real thing
[37:41] and they want to talk to Bitcoin experts
[37:43] and they want all these other products
[37:44] like, you know, inheritance and custody
[37:46] and, you know, more or less risk,
[37:49] reward, tradeoff, and then some asset
[37:51] management, asset back loans, etc., etc.
[37:54] And that's where a company like Swan
[37:55] steps in. So, I'd say instead of kind of
[37:58] like battling it out versus Coinbase for
[38:00] that first touch and that first $100
[38:03] buy, uh, we
[38:06] now pushed down in funnel a little bit
[38:09] and got pushed up market. So, we focus a
[38:12] lot more on I wouldn't say whales, it's
[38:15] probably more like uh deer. I think
[38:17] we're a deer hunting platform where we
[38:19] kind of serve like the upper end of mass
[38:21] affluent and and then high net worth and
[38:24] ultra high net worth. but where we are
[38:25] their investment team, not where they
[38:28] have a team. So, I think if you go all
[38:30] the way up to, you know, corporates uh
[38:33] that have big committees and you're not
[38:35] talking to a Bitcoiner on the other
[38:36] side, they're just kind of making like a
[38:38] rational economic case for allocating 1%
[38:40] of some insurance portfolio. Like that's
[38:42] what Ross Stevens and the Naidig team is
[38:44] for. They come from Wall Street. They
[38:46] have credibility on Wall Street. They
[38:48] know the ratings agencies. They can get,
[38:50] you know, loan pools rated by Moody's.
[38:52] you know, it's a whole different game
[38:54] and you have to be in New York for 30
[38:55] years to play it. Um, but I think just
[38:58] below that for the people that are
[38:59] buying, you know, maybe up to 100
[39:01] million, um, and you're kind of dealing
[39:03] with like maybe a family office or
[39:05] something like that, but there's a
[39:06] principle making the decision. Uh, I
[39:09] think that's squarely where Swan fits.
[39:12] The hunter, I love it. Never heard that
[39:14] one. The hunter, not hunter. Yeah, we we
[39:17] have lots of nerdy analogies and
[39:19] frameworks in the US. And you can do it
[39:20] either with land animals or water
[39:23] animals. So the land animal one is uh
[39:25] rabbits, deer, and
[39:26] elephants. So rabbits would be like cash
[39:29] app, elephants would be like Naidig, and
[39:31] deer is swan. Um, and then there's the
[39:34] land version. I'm sorry, the the water
[39:36] version is uh I think minnows, dolphins,
[39:39] and
[39:40] whales. But I don't like hunting
[39:42] dolphins. It sounds mean. So anyway,
[39:45] maybe we catch and release the dolphins,
[39:47] get them into self- custody.
[39:50] Yeah, it's like hunting dolphins could
[39:52] be bad for marketing if you push that.
[39:55] Somehow the poor deer, little Bambi just
[39:57] gets screwed in this one.
[39:59] Deer is it's it's it's also an animal,
[40:02] but it's it seems like more normal to to
[40:05] hunt those than than dolphins. Yeah. Any
[40:08] Well, how about this? How about we help
[40:09] the deer and we help the dolphins? I
[40:12] think that's Yeah, we're hunt hunting
[40:15] the the deers that they don't get uh
[40:18] shot. There you go. Yeah. Yeah, exactly.
[40:21] The store of value on and mirror of
[40:23] exchange uh the sov andov discussion is
[40:27] really interesting. Um I've had Jeff
[40:30] poof on for the second time I think like
[40:32] a month or two months ago and and and he
[40:34] said the sentence that still doesn't
[40:36] really make sense for me but I try to
[40:38] crock it ever since. uh he said when
[40:41] when Bitcoin fails as a medium of
[40:43] exchange, it would also fail as a as a
[40:45] store of value. Um whereas there's a lot
[40:48] of examples of like yeah, real estate is
[40:50] a is a is has has seen to be a good
[40:54] store of value over the past years um
[40:56] but hasn't been any media exchange. How
[40:59] do you how do you look at um the those
[41:02] both requiring each other?
[41:05] Well, I don't know about fail, but it
[41:07] would be uh its upside would be
[41:10] dramatically chopped if it's not useful
[41:14] uh if it can't be used as a medium of
[41:16] exchange. I don't think we run any risk
[41:18] of that whatsoever. It's just a matter
[41:20] of the quality and sovereignty of the
[41:21] medium of exchange. It's whether it will
[41:23] actually scale in a self-custody way for
[41:25] those people that want to use it that
[41:27] way. Um but you know already it works as
[41:30] a medium of exchange in the traditional
[41:31] financial system just by literally
[41:33] replacing a dollar sign with a B sign.
[41:35] It can use as Sailor often says the last
[41:38] mile can just be trady and banks and
[41:40] payment apps and things like that. And
[41:42] that's what you see a lot. It's it's
[41:44] just not it's not hard to transact from
[41:47] store value being Bitcoin. Here really
[41:50] the the medium of exchange doesn't
[41:52] matter. But what matters is what did the
[41:54] payer store their value in and what does
[41:56] the receiver store their value in. You
[41:58] know I I pay for things throughout
[42:00] Europe and Turkey and you know the
[42:02] merchant is accepting euros or accepting
[42:04] pounds or accepting lera and I'm
[42:06] spending dollars and nobody gives a
[42:08]  They don't even need to know that.
[42:10] That just happens in the background. So,
[42:12] you know, this
[42:14] uh you know, I
[42:16] think
[42:21] getting I just think it will inevitably
[42:24] be used as a medium of exchange because
[42:27] it's when you do have people on both
[42:29] sides of the transaction that prefer
[42:31] Bitcoin, then you will just use Bitcoin
[42:33] to
[42:34] transact. That's just how it's going to
[42:36] be. So, if I prefer to receive Bitcoin
[42:38] and you have Bitcoin already, we're not
[42:41] going to send it through dollars first.
[42:44] You're just going to send me Bitcoin.
[42:46] That makes a lot of sense. transaction.
[42:48] Yeah. So, but but rushing it and
[42:51] freaking out about it when we're so
[42:53] early in Bitcoin as a store of value. I
[42:55] mean, I I'll tell you right now, I don't
[42:57] expect Bitcoin to be a widely used meme
[42:59] exchange until it's probably $2 million
[43:00] a coin. So, like $40 trillion market
[43:04] cap, another 20x from here. Uh so if
[43:07] anyone is kind of freaking out that we
[43:09] don't have Bitcoin widely used as a
[43:10] medium of exchange and they want to
[43:12] change the protocol and they're like oh
[43:14] my god the failure of a circular economy
[43:16] in some third world country it's like
[43:18] dude it wasn't going to work no matter
[43:19] what there's no point. Um you know so
[43:23] keep building the tech look for cases
[43:25] where uh it is the best tool for the job
[43:28] which is again where both the the sender
[43:31] and the receiver prefer Bitcoin. That's
[43:33] the best. That's when Bitcoin is the
[43:35] best for sending the value. Um,
[43:38] remittances are very good for that. We
[43:39] pay a bunch of contractors and vendors
[43:41] in Bitcoin because they're orange pill
[43:43] and they want Bitcoin and we can send it
[43:45] to them because we have Bitcoin. That's
[43:47] a great use for it. Uh, you know, trying
[43:50] to pay in Bitcoin for some fiat
[43:52] receivable from some company that's not
[43:54] orange pill, it's like why? What's the
[43:56] point?
[43:58] It makes a lot of sense. I also pay one
[44:00] one freelancer, one contractor in in
[44:02] Bitcoin. And I looked at my bank how
[44:05] much it would have how how how expensive
[44:08] this would be because she's in a a
[44:11] different country. How expensive this
[44:12] would be to send it. And it's about like
[44:15] 5 to 10 that I have to spend more. And
[44:18] the Bitcoin transaction usually cost me
[44:20] around 50 to 70 cents currently because
[44:23] we have low transaction fees. It's it's
[44:25] it's amazing how how how cheap and how
[44:27] great this actually works. and you don't
[44:29] have to fill out like the address or and
[44:31] all those KYC things that you need.
[44:34] Yeah. No, it it is absolutely amazing to
[44:37] send money on a blockchain. It's
[44:39] awesome.
[44:41] Really cool. Um, one thing that you also
[44:43] mentioned is is the ETF. I just want to
[44:45] quickly touch on that because um I think
[44:48] the second year of the ETF is probably
[44:51] the the maybe the more important year
[44:53] even for an ETF than the first one
[44:55] because those products need a little bit
[44:57] of of time to really uh get get it full
[45:00] speed. How what do you what do you
[45:03] expect from from the the second year or
[45:05] like now we are already in the second
[45:06] year of the the ETF?
[45:09] Um, I mean the numbers have been great
[45:11] and it looks like it's been uh enough to
[45:14] sustain. Maybe one of the most
[45:16] interesting things is how good a product
[45:18] it's been for the the three through 10
[45:20] players. So outside of Black Rockck and
[45:23] Fidelity, it has been an amazing win for
[45:26] Bitwise, for Arc, and for some of the
[45:27] other smaller ones. Like it's really
[45:29] meaningful to their businesses. Um, and
[45:32] they're having success marketing it,
[45:34] just competing on promo periods and fees
[45:36] and things like that. and and still able
[45:38] to grow a vertical around this. Um and
[45:42] then the explosion of uh derivative
[45:44] products off the ETFs is a big deal. So
[45:47] having options on ETFs, having you know
[45:49] 2x long ETFs and short ETFs and things
[45:52] like that. So it's just kind of the
[45:54] continued financialization. Uh it's also
[45:56] a big deal for a lot of investors to be
[45:58] able to include the balance of their
[46:00] Bitcoin price exposure because they own
[46:02] own the ticker uh in portfolio loans,
[46:05] you know, so being able to buy a house
[46:07] just with a you know, pretty cheap
[46:09] portfolio loan that's going to be uh
[46:12] priced better by a long shot for most
[46:15] wealthy people than a Bitcoin backed
[46:17] loan, like NASA backed loan from one of
[46:19] the lenders. Um so that's been a big a
[46:22] big use case as well. I think the next
[46:25] step is probably uh you know figuring
[46:28] out how to uh move people faster and
[46:31] faster uh out of ETFs into real Bitcoin.
[46:35] And I think that will be the next step
[46:37] is educating the ETF holders about why
[46:40] real Bitcoin is better and what you can
[46:42] do with it and kind of moving moving
[46:44] that. That's a big thing that we do. You
[46:47] know, I cheerlead the ETFs, but I also
[46:49] just consider them as like a starting
[46:50] point. It's not the end state for most
[46:52] people.
[46:54] I hope they in in Europe they already
[46:56] have the the one that is already there
[46:58] since 2015 the inind withdrawal would be
[47:02] really cool to have just like in kind
[47:03] withdrawal for all the uh the ETF so
[47:06] it's easy to switch to actual self
[47:09] custody. It's certainly not in their
[47:11] interest and they're not going to do it
[47:12] willingly.
[47:15] Hopefully the market forces them to do
[47:16] it.
[47:18] Yep. Hopefully. Um I have one question
[47:21] to ask each and every one of my guests
[47:23] and the question is what can we learn
[47:24] from you besides Bitcoin?
[47:27] Uh I can teach people uh a step back
[47:31] jumper in
[47:35] basketball. I got I got a lot of moves
[47:37] when it comes to getting a jump shot
[47:40] off. Um I don't know. Let me think.
[47:44] Uh uh I have a really good list of uh
[47:48] places to visit and things to do in
[47:50] Turkey because I've been going every
[47:51] summer for 15 years. So that's something
[47:53] that Bitcoiners hit me up for a lot. I
[47:56] have kind of the compendium of
[47:58] restaurants and tourist sites and
[47:59] neighborhoods and things like that cuz
[48:01] uh wife is from Turkey and I go every
[48:03] summer. Oh, okay. Your wife is from from
[48:06] Turkey. Okay, that's why I was like it's
[48:09] interesting an interesting place to to
[48:11] select. So I like I know a lot about bis
[48:13] Bitcoin, Turkey and basketball.
[48:18] I loved I love the combination. We have
[48:20] an interview in the podcast where the
[48:21] previous guest is asking a question for
[48:23] the next guest without knowing who the
[48:24] next guest h actually is and the
[48:27] previous guest asked you the question.
[48:29] How many people in the world do you
[48:31] think really truly understand Bitcoin?
[48:35] Uh it's up quite a lot in the last few
[48:39] years. Um, I would have said something
[48:41] like probably
[48:43] 200,000 in 2021. Um, I honestly probably
[48:49] like 2 million that really understand
[48:50] Bitcoin like pretty deeply like you and
[48:53] I. And I don't even So, so low bar, as
[48:56] much as I understand Bitcoin, I think
[48:57] there's probably two million people here
[48:59] or deeper. True. Yeah. It's it's super
[49:02] hard for for me to because it's like uh
[49:05] if you imagine eight billion people and
[49:07] there's like two million that really
[49:08] truly understand it. It's like oh gosh
[49:11] we we're super early. But yeah, thank
[49:14] you so much um Cory for for being on. Uh
[49:16] before I let you go, where can people
[49:17] find you, ask your questions, and reach
[49:19] out to you? Yeah, sure. Uh well, first
[49:21] off, I think people assume that uh I get
[49:24] tons of emails, but since we don't use
[49:26] email at swan, I'll see it. So, you can
[49:28] actually just email me coryswan.com if
[49:31] you have questions about, you know, the
[49:33] company or Bitcoin or whatever. Um,
[49:34] we'll get it answered and and help you
[49:36] out. Um, otherwise on Twitter, uh, Swan
[49:39] Sin is the company handle. Put out a lot
[49:42] of cool media and things like that. Uh,
[49:44] and I'm Cory Clipton, full name on
[49:46] Twitter, so that's probably a good place
[49:47] to start. Thank you so much for taking
[49:49] the time. And also, thank you so much
[49:50] for everyone that is watching and
[49:52] listening for joining us today. As
[49:53] always, I'll be back tomorrow with
[49:54] another episode. Bye-bye.
