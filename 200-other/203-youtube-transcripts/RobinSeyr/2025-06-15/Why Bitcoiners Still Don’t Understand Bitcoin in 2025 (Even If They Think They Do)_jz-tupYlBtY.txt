[00:00] If you ask the question, how many people
[00:02] really understand this? It's probably
[00:04] just a few thousand. I would say you can
[00:07] understand it, but you don't really
[00:09] understand it. It's only when you write
[00:11] about it that you go to another level of
[00:13] understanding it. I mean, the truth is
[00:14] there is no mental model because there
[00:16] has never been anything like Bitcoin in
[00:19] history. So there's it's very difficult
[00:21] to find an analogy or something to
[00:23] relate it to. If you look at something
[00:24] in in a silo, you look at it just from
[00:26] its technology or just from its
[00:28] political aspect or just from its
[00:30] investment, you miss the big picture and
[00:32] then you might just reject it. In many
[00:34] ways, Bitcoin makes the original
[00:38] rationale for fiat redundant because the
[00:40] only reason you moved away from gold was
[00:42] because of these shortcomings, all of
[00:44] which have been solved. All of that is
[00:46] fundamentally different from the
[00:47] foundational invention that is digital
[00:50] scarcity and that is Bitcoin.
[00:53] [Music]
[00:56] Hi, Rich. How are you doing? Everything
[00:58] fine on your end? Uh, yeah. Yeah, great
[01:00] to be here. Thank you for having me,
[01:02] Robin. Um, yeah, I've watched a few of
[01:04] your episodes. Uh, really enjoy them.
[01:06] So, so very happy to be on and speaking
[01:08] to you. Awesome. Um, maybe before we get
[01:11] into the topics, um, give the people a
[01:14] little bit of an overview of who you are
[01:15] and why you're excited about Bitcoin.
[01:19] Yeah, so I'm a lawyer. I'm a attorney in
[01:22] the US um and also a solicitor in the
[01:25] UK. Um I spend most of my career at
[01:28] Goldman Sachs um in New York and then
[01:31] Hong Kong and Singapore. So so I'm sort
[01:33] of very much from the traditional
[01:35] finance sort of world um practiced as a
[01:38] lawyer in New York and and and London as
[01:40] well. Um and then I I suppose um so and
[01:44] and currently I'm I'm international
[01:47] general counsel at Gemini um based in in
[01:50] in London and I cover sort of you know
[01:52] globally regulatory um sort of matters
[01:55] licensing all that kind of thing.
[01:57] Um yeah so why Bitcoin? I think I would
[02:00] say um I mean I started going down this
[02:04] rabbit hole a long long time ago. I'd
[02:07] say maybe 2013 is when I first came
[02:09] across Bitcoin. It's been a long journey
[02:11] in in rejecting it first and then um you
[02:15] know somewhat reluctantly starting to
[02:18] learn about it and then finally really
[02:19] going down that rabbit hole. So um so I
[02:23] think it was probably around 2021 that I
[02:26] decided okay I'd like to be in the space
[02:27] kind of more full-time. So I left
[02:29] Goldman and I moved into into the into
[02:32] the space sort of thing. And it was
[02:34] around then that I started writing as
[02:35] well in this space. And the culmination
[02:37] of all of that is this book that uh
[02:39] Columbia University Press uh is actually
[02:42] officially publishing only next month
[02:44] although it's already out on Amazon. Um
[02:46] but yeah, it's this book principles of
[02:48] Bitcoin that I that I wrote. Yeah, super
[02:51] interesting. Um, and I'm like I think
[02:54] all those pe people that that write
[02:56] books uh have gone because I under I I'm
[03:01] trying those myself to to write a book
[03:03] currently and I completely
[03:05] underestimated how how hard this is
[03:08] actually to write the things down that
[03:10] you already know and you kind of want to
[03:12] have it in a condensed form uh on on
[03:15] some pages that that's really really
[03:17] really hard. Um why did you decide to to
[03:20] write a book? because it's your first
[03:21] one. Or is it just the first one in
[03:22] Bitcoin? Yeah. So, I mean, I I never
[03:25] actually intended to write a book.
[03:26] That's the funny thing. It's never it's
[03:28] it wasn't that okay, I want to write a
[03:29] book. What do I write about? Let me
[03:31] write about Bitcoin. You know, that
[03:33] that's not how it happened. Um I I I
[03:36] wrote a paper about Bitcoin in 2020. Um
[03:39] and then on the back of that, I thought,
[03:41] okay, I want to build on this a little
[03:42] bit more. And then so I sent it I sent
[03:45] what I wrote to some publishers and they
[03:47] really liked They asked me to develop on
[03:48] some aspects of it and so it was
[03:51] initially a 10-page uh you know paper.
[03:53] It was not even 10 pages and then I
[03:55] wrote a bit more and a bit more and a
[03:56] bit more and before I knew it I had a
[03:59] sort of 320 page book. So that's how
[04:02] that's how it kind of it just happened.
[04:03] It it it wasn't something that I planned
[04:06] or you know sort of wanted to do uh
[04:08] since I was a child or something like
[04:10] that. It's just kind of just happened.
[04:12] Um but in terms of the process, it's a
[04:15] it's a very rewarding process. So, if
[04:16] you're looking at writing a book, I
[04:17] would yeah, you should you should
[04:19] definitely do it. Um, I think you never
[04:23] I don't know if someone I've heard
[04:25] someone saying this. It might have been
[04:26] Safe Dean or someone else. You don't you
[04:28] never really understand
[04:31] something until you write about it or
[04:34] teach it because it's only that process
[04:38] of essentially uh
[04:40] synthesizing the material when you when
[04:43] you actually learn it. just listening to
[04:45] something on a podcast or reading about
[04:47] it, you can understand it, but you don't
[04:50] really understand it. It's only when you
[04:51] write about it that you go to another
[04:53] level of understanding it. Um, so it's
[04:57] it's a extremely rewarding experience.
[04:59] What have you learned about Bitcoin in
[05:01] the in the process of of writing about
[05:03] Bitcoin?
[05:05] Sure. So, I mean, my my focus has been
[05:09] um because I come from this traditional
[05:12] finance world, right? I spent my entire
[05:14] career in the space, you know, sort of
[05:16] lawyer, banker sort of thing.
[05:19] Um, I I kind of understand how people
[05:22] think about this coming from the
[05:24] outside, coming from the traditional
[05:26] world. So, what really interested me
[05:29] when I when I finally got it and I, you
[05:32] know, sort of really understood what
[05:33] Bitcoin was, what really interested me
[05:35] was why is it so hard to understand? Why
[05:38] do people particularly from the
[05:40] traditional world why do they find it so
[05:42] difficult to understand what this is?
[05:44] And I mean there's plenty of reasons for
[05:46] that. I mean it's you know kind of some
[05:48] people are just you're just lazy you
[05:49] know sort of you're you can't be
[05:51] bothered to to spend the time reading
[05:53] about something and trying to understand
[05:54] it. Um it's also a lot of people are
[05:58] just very arrogant you know sort of
[06:00] intellectually arrogant about legacy
[06:02] finance. You go to someone, you know,
[06:03] sort of a very successful private equity
[06:06] guy or, you know, hedge fund manager
[06:07] who's made tens of millions or hundreds
[06:09] of millions, maybe billions, you know,
[06:12] on his, you know, through his
[06:13] investments in the traditional world,
[06:15] traditional financial world and tell
[06:17] him, you know what, you've missed
[06:19] this. You know, you're not going to get
[06:20] a very, you know, sort of you take Jamie
[06:23] Diamond or, you know, someone who's the
[06:25] king of Wall Street, you know, you tell
[06:26] him, you've completely missed this, he's
[06:29] not going to react very well to it, you
[06:31] know. So there's also that kind of ego
[06:33] sort of aspect to it. But what I think
[06:35] is but you know all sort of saying
[06:37] someone is lazy or arrogant doesn't
[06:39] really help. So but but if you if you if
[06:42] you look at it from the perspective of
[06:44] okay what is the what is the right
[06:45] mental model to use to think about
[06:49] Bitcoin and that is something that I
[06:51] really struggle with and I mean the
[06:53] truth is there is no mental model
[06:55] because there has never been anything
[06:57] like Bitcoin in history. So there's it's
[07:00] very difficult to find an analogy or
[07:02] something to relate it to. And so so my
[07:05] goal in writing this book was was to was
[07:08] to try to come up with that kind of a
[07:10] mental model. And and I and I looked at
[07:14] it from two perspectives. One was I
[07:15] wanted to really take it in a from a
[07:17] from a first principles perspective. So
[07:20] really asking the question just hang on
[07:22] a minute. Let's not talk about
[07:24] blockchain and crypto and you know uh
[07:27] metaverse and web 3 and all of that.
[07:30] What was the core innovation of Satoshi?
[07:33] What is this all about? Right? So you
[07:35] answer that question. And then the
[07:37] second aspect of it was you've got to
[07:39] look at it
[07:40] holistically. You can't I mean human
[07:43] human beings are programmed to look at
[07:45] things holistically the big picture. If
[07:48] you look at something in in a silo, you
[07:50] look at it just from its technology or
[07:51] just from its political aspect or just
[07:54] from its investment, you know, thesis,
[07:57] you miss the big picture and then you
[07:58] might just reject it. So looking at it
[08:01] holistically was was the other thing. So
[08:02] that's why so my book is principles of
[08:04] Bitcoin, technology, economics,
[08:07] politics, and philosophy. So so I argue
[08:10] that you've got to look at it from all
[08:12] these four angles. There are many more
[08:14] angles, but I've just made a start with
[08:15] these four. you've got to look at it
[08:17] from these four aspects and and that's
[08:22] you know a path to to understanding it
[08:25] better. So so that was kind of what I I
[08:28] tried that was the the lens through
[08:30] which I tried to to approach um approach
[08:34] the the um you know the explanation
[08:38] interesting there are really a lot of
[08:40] interesting things in there. I also uh I
[08:42] said that I think uh like last week or
[08:44] something like that where I was guest on
[08:46] a podcast. Um like what what's basically
[08:48] holding Bitcoin back? Uh and I I was
[08:51] like people are people that don't
[08:54] understand Bitcoin are either arrogant
[08:56] or lazy or just ignorant. They they they
[09:00] hear about it. Uh they but they just
[09:03] like push it aside for a moment. They're
[09:06] like I don't want to deal with that now.
[09:07] I don't want to. and then they maybe
[09:09] build an opinion just because they read
[09:11] something in a headline and then they
[09:13] adopt that opinion even though they
[09:15] never really looked deeper and u I think
[09:18] we as as Bitcoin educators really have
[09:20] to fight against those um
[09:23] misinformations out there or this
[09:25] different opinions and we have to fight
[09:26] in this uh digital information warfare
[09:29] that's that's currently so I'm I'm I'm
[09:32] so grateful for every educator content
[09:34] creator uh author blog article writer
[09:38] what whatever you are doing like every
[09:40] single piece of content helps in in in
[09:43] this this educational war. Yeah, there's
[09:46] there's a you know um there's this
[09:48] Twitter meme uh Bitcoin is an IQ test,
[09:52] right? You might have seen that. Um I I
[09:54] I don't think that's true because I mean
[09:56] there are plenty of people in
[09:58] traditional finance who are
[10:00] exceptionally smart. I mean their their
[10:02] IQs would be significantly higher than
[10:04] some of the smartest Bitcoiners, but
[10:06] they don't get it. And the reason for
[10:08] that is not it's not intelligence or IQ
[10:10] or anything. It's just that they're not
[10:12] open-minded. So I so I like to say it's
[10:14] not Bitcoin is not an IQ test. It's an
[10:16] open-mindedness test. It's a test of how
[10:19] intellectually honest you are, how um
[10:23] intellectually humble you are as well
[10:25] and open-minded uh to new ideas and and
[10:29] to to accept
[10:30] that maybe you got it wrong. Maybe you
[10:33] missed something here. you know, just
[10:35] having the the ability to to come to
[10:37] terms with that. I think it's a test of
[10:39] that. It's not it's not an IQ test.
[10:42] Yeah. This this ego death because like
[10:45] almost every Bitcoiner heard about
[10:47] Bitcoin a few years before they first
[10:49] bought Bitcoin and then you have to say,
[10:52] "Oh, yeah. I missed it. I missed it
[10:54] three years ago and now I have to buy a
[10:56] higher price." That that's kind of the
[10:57] thing that that most people have to go
[11:00] through. Yeah. There's there's another
[11:01] meme which is uh everybody buys Bitcoin
[11:04] at the price they deserve, right? It
[11:06] sounds a bit biblical and kind of old
[11:08] testamenty, but but it's there's there's
[11:10] some truth there, right? You sort of uh
[11:13] it's it's only when you you accept
[11:17] um that yeah, you might have missed it,
[11:18] you might have got it wrong, that's when
[11:20] the the actual learning and the kind of
[11:22] you know journey begins. So yeah. Is is
[11:25] there something else that you think uh
[11:27] Bitcoin is holding back currently? I
[11:29] mean, today maybe is a bad day to ask
[11:31] that because we at a new alltime high at
[11:34] at the time of the the recording, but is
[11:36] there something that you feel like
[11:38] Bitcoin should be higher, but it's not
[11:40] higher because like we haven't uh done
[11:43] this or like there's this thing that uh
[11:45] that we that needs to happen before we
[11:48] enter um a new adoption rate or new a
[11:51] new price level.
[11:53] I think I think it's just um you know
[11:56] people coming like understanding it,
[11:58] right? Yes. So, as you pointed out, I
[11:59] think education
[12:01] um you know, I I think I mean the truth
[12:03] is
[12:04] that you I mean there's all these
[12:06] statistics that there's 150 million
[12:08] people who own Bitcoin and you know and
[12:11] all of that that that means nothing,
[12:12] right? Like a lot of them are just
[12:14] someone who just opened a Coinbase
[12:16] account and got a $10 reward in in
[12:19] Bitcoin and and so they're they're one
[12:21] of the 150 million, right? They might
[12:23] not know anything about Bitcoin other
[12:24] than how to spell it or something,
[12:26] right? So, so those those statistics
[12:27] mean nothing. If you if you ask the
[12:29] question, how many people really
[12:31] understand this, right? It's probably
[12:35] just a few thousand I would say. I I I
[12:38] cannot imagine that more than 50,000
[12:41] people actually truly understand Bitcoin
[12:46] um currently in the world, which is just
[12:48] minuscule, right? Um so and I and I
[12:53] there's you know several reasons for
[12:54] that some of which we just talked about
[12:56] but I think that is going to be that's
[12:58] what's holding it back and that is going
[13:00] to be the journey but it's it's just how
[13:03] it is right um that's just the natural
[13:07] path of adoption
[13:09] um and and you just have to have to go
[13:13] with it. It's you know it's sort of it's
[13:14] the law laws of the jungle. It's the
[13:16] laws of nature. It's people who are you
[13:19] know who have that curiosity who want to
[13:22] go out there and explore they will be
[13:23] the earlier adopters and the lagards
[13:25] will come in at a much later date right
[13:28] um that's just the natural progression
[13:32] um but in terms of yeah it's what's
[13:34] holding it back I think yeah we need
[13:35] more education resources we need um and
[13:39] I and I also believe that crypto has
[13:42] confused it a lot when people conflate
[13:46] Bitcoin coin with
[13:49] Trumpcoin or Doge and Pepe and you know
[13:52] all these other or you know monkey JPEGs
[13:55] you know board apes and NFTs and all of
[13:57] that fine I mean I don't no judgment if
[13:59] you want to do that that's that's great
[14:02] but it's not Bitcoin none of those are
[14:04] disrupting monetary policy none of those
[14:06] are uh you know making any claim to
[14:09] being money but when the general public
[14:13] look at these things they look at
[14:15] everything under the umbrella of crypto
[14:16] and And for them it's all the same
[14:18] thing, right? So I think that is also a
[14:20] huge uh reason why I think it still
[14:23] remains so misunderstood.
[14:26] Interesting. And I I really want to uh
[14:28] get your take on altcoins also a little
[14:30] bit later. Uh but it's super interesting
[14:33] uh to also see the the natural selection
[14:36] of of of people and how they get it and
[14:38] how they don't don't get it. And I'm
[14:41] always really um impressed with people
[14:44] that worked in the traditional financial
[14:46] space and get Bitcoin because the
[14:49] incumbent system that works in that very
[14:51] system that gets revolutionized or gets
[14:54] a paradigm shift, this is usually the
[14:57] people that get it the least because
[14:59] they're inside a system and they cannot
[15:01] see outside of the system. They're too
[15:02] too deep inside. But there are instances
[15:06] of bankers of people that work in
[15:08] banking in different sections um like
[15:10] you as a lawyer also like but marketing
[15:12] but in banking in general that or
[15:15] investment bank they they actually get
[15:16] it. They're like oh wait there's this
[15:18] Bitcoin thing and this explains so many
[15:21] things that wasn't making sense in in
[15:23] the thing that I actually worked in. How
[15:25] did you like what was the moment for you
[15:27] where you realized oh like Bitcoin
[15:30] makes sense for me? So, so I was a a a
[15:34] gold investor. So, so, so I'm, you know,
[15:37] I I was a lawyer during the 2008
[15:41] financial crisis. I pre208 I worked on
[15:45] CDOS's, CDS's, all the things that
[15:47] caused the crisis. I was very much I
[15:49] worked on the Leman um I worked on
[15:52] bailout uh you know, packages for Morgan
[15:54] Stanley and and and so on. I was very
[15:56] much involved in that uh u not bailout
[15:59] but the the tarp. it was troubled asset
[16:01] repurchase program in 2008. You know, I
[16:04] was very much um part of that whole um
[16:07] crisis. Uh so in the aftermath of that,
[16:10] I I really got into gold and I could see
[16:12] the flaws in the monetary system, the
[16:13] central banking uh system. It was very
[16:16] evident to me and so I I um and and the
[16:19] death of the free market, right? It was
[16:21] it was very apparent when when um all
[16:23] the things that were happening in 2008.
[16:25] I didn't hear about Bitcoin in 2008 or
[16:27] 2009. Um I don't think many people did.
[16:31] It was just happening somewhere in the
[16:32] corner in a corner of the internet. Um
[16:35] but but I went down the gold path and so
[16:38] I I I invested in gold back then and I
[16:42] don't know if you follow gold prices. It
[16:44] was just a decade of it was a painful
[16:48] decade for gold investors. It just went
[16:50] nowhere and you had the stock market
[16:52] going up to the moon and and gold just
[16:54] went nowhere. But but but to answer your
[16:56] question, I was I mean that's the
[16:58] mindset. I I was always I kind of could
[17:00] see the flaws in the system in the
[17:02] monetary system, but I I I didn't know
[17:04] where to go and so gold seemed the most
[17:06] obvious one. So for me it was an easy
[17:09] jump. All I needed to do I understood
[17:12] the the economics of it. I understood
[17:14] the monetary policy aspects of the
[17:16] Bitcoin story. What I needed was that
[17:19] the technology piece just to understand
[17:22] digital gold just to understand that you
[17:25] know the 21 million absolute scarcity
[17:27] how that's achieved in the digital realm
[17:30] those are big leaps right and and you
[17:32] don't get it from just a few hours of
[17:34] study it takes a thousand hours to truly
[17:36] understand digital scarcity I believe
[17:38] that it's take you know kind of um it's
[17:40] it's been the case with
[17:42] me
[17:43] so that's kind of uh that leap I think
[17:48] occurred over several years and and it
[17:50] was just a question of, you know,
[17:53] reading about it, questioning it,
[17:56] rejecting it, coming back to it, you
[18:00] know. Yeah. And and and I'm I'm grateful
[18:02] to many of those educators that, you
[18:05] know, I I had the the good fortune to be
[18:08] exposed to back then. Um Yeah. Yeah.
[18:12] It's it's it's now one one thing is for
[18:15] sure like there's now so many great
[18:17] educators already in the space when you
[18:19] look back let's say I don't know to 2017
[18:24] which were also a really big spike the
[18:26] Bitcoin standard of cyodine was not even
[18:28] out
[18:30] the the Bitcoin only content creator
[18:33] space there was like rarely podcasts
[18:35] rarely uh daily YouTube shows or
[18:37] anything like that um uh I think um Ben
[18:41] from PDC sessions already made videos
[18:43] but it was not that uh that much also.
[18:46] So the the if you come in 2025 into the
[18:50] Bitcoin econo uh ecosystem you can get
[18:53] orange build within weeks because you
[18:57] have so much content out there and it's
[18:58] so good that justable. If you get in
[19:00] like 2017 you need a long time to to
[19:03] sift through all the
[19:04] noise%. Yeah. I mean, I think people
[19:07] like Trace Meyer, I don't know if you if
[19:09] you came across, he he like some of his
[19:12] podcasts were very helpful. Um, and then
[19:16] later on, I I you know, I think GG um
[19:19] was a big um one of those moments for me
[19:23] when I when I really got it,
[19:24] particularly his explanation of map is
[19:28] the territory. I don't know if you've
[19:29] read that. There's a he wrote a paper
[19:31] called Bitcoin is time. Um if you
[19:33] haven't read it, it's it's on it's you
[19:35] know available on his website and and
[19:37] various others. Um but he talks about
[19:41] this idea that you know it's it's
[19:43] essentially peer-to-peer transactions is
[19:46] the laws of physics applying in the
[19:48] digital realm and and he talks about map
[19:51] is the map is the territory. When you
[19:53] when you when you have say gold back
[19:56] certificates the gold is the territory
[19:58] and the certificates are the map, right?
[20:01] And so they're separate and the reason
[20:03] you have the the separation is is to
[20:06] solve problems of portability uh you
[20:08] know transferability transactability and
[20:10] and divisibility and you know all of
[20:13] verifiability and such things but with
[20:16] Bitcoin it's the the record itself is
[20:20] the asset. So the map is the territory,
[20:23] you know, it is those types of things,
[20:25] you know, sort of that were for me they
[20:28] were very very um critical moments in
[20:31] the sort of light bulb going off. Yeah.
[20:35] Do you also think because um you
[20:36] mentioned gold that you got bit that you
[20:38] got gold and then it was an easier jump
[20:40] to Bitcoin. Do you think because of that
[20:42] reason because gold is so close to the
[20:45] value proposition of Bitcoin that gold
[20:47] might be the first asset that gets
[20:50] demonetized in a big way against Bitcoin
[20:53] and kind of gets uh gets more and more
[20:56] to the utility value of of what gold is
[20:58] and and less and less about the monetary
[21:00] premium that it holds. Yeah, I think so.
[21:02] It's possible but but you know the thing
[21:04] is that you look very I mean you know
[21:06] Indian families and Chinese families own
[21:10] you know I think most of the gold in the
[21:12] world you know sort of a very large
[21:13] share of it you're not going to be able
[21:16] to educate you go to a random Indian
[21:19] family in a in a in a you know middle
[21:21] class uh Indian community and and say
[21:24] you know give me your gold jewels and
[21:26] I'll give you this magic internet money.
[21:28] It's a much much harder journey. So, so
[21:32] I think it it'll it'll take it'll take a
[21:35] while for for gold to get demonetized. I
[21:37] don't I yeah I I don't see that as being
[21:40] the the progression. I think um US I I
[21:45] think treasuries, government bonds, the
[21:48] bond market will be the first one to
[21:50] fall victim and then perhaps other class
[21:53] asset classes. Yeah. Yeah. I I have an
[21:56] Indian girlfriend so I and I understand
[21:59] how manifested gold is in their culture
[22:02] and how important it is also with
[22:04] marriages and and gifting gold and
[22:06] giving it from generation to generation.
[22:09] It's fascinating how anchored it is. But
[22:14] it was because of that reason that it
[22:16] was really easy actually for my
[22:17] girlfriend over time to understand
[22:19] Bitcoin and she's now all in Bitcoin. So
[22:21] um may maybe that's a maybe it's a good
[22:24] thing if they understand uh uh gold. Uh
[22:27] it it will take time of course to to get
[22:29] away from gold but the yeah the network
[22:32] effects are are really strong of gold
[22:35] but it it will happen over time and and
[22:37] long enough exposure to Bitcoin content.
[22:40] Yeah. Yeah. Exactly.
[22:42] Um I mean it's it's
[22:44] um it's interesting
[22:46] that you know gold only has a market cap
[22:51] of $20 billion right you you think about
[22:54] if if the and this is where there is a
[22:58] little bit of a cognitive issue if you
[22:59] think about you say that you know
[23:01] bitcoin's biggest selling point is its
[23:03] scarcity
[23:05] um then on the basis of
[23:08] scarcity gold should have a much much
[23:11] bigger market cap, but it doesn't,
[23:14] right? Like why hasn't gold disrupted
[23:17] more of the monetary premium that fiat
[23:20] has, right? And and the reason for that
[23:23] is
[23:24] obviously lack of portability,
[23:27] divisibility, verifiability, all those
[23:29] other constraints that gold has suffered
[23:31] which was the basis for fiat money's you
[23:35] know introduction and evolution. Um and
[23:38] and Bitcoin makes all those reasons
[23:41] redundant because it you know kind of
[23:43] it's it's more portable than fiat. It's
[23:46] more um divisible. It's divisible. It's
[23:49] more verifiable. It's you know it is
[23:51] superior. So it kind of in many ways
[23:56] Bitcoin makes the original rationale for
[24:00] fiat redundant. there's no rationale for
[24:04] its existence any longer because the
[24:06] only reason you moved away from gold was
[24:08] because of these shortcomings all of
[24:10] which have been solved. So that's an
[24:13] interesting kind of that's that's one
[24:16] kind uh you know explanation that I
[24:18] found quite helpful to explain to people
[24:20] uh when they say no it's okay so you
[24:22] know gold is 8,000 years it's it's been
[24:24] around for 8,000 years and and you know
[24:26] why hasn't it why isn't it more than you
[24:29] know 20 billion market cap why is it why
[24:31] did people abandon it the fact that
[24:33] people abandon it demonstrates that it
[24:35] can never be money so Bitcoin can never
[24:37] be money but this is the reason it's
[24:40] because of these shortcomings the abs
[24:42] sense of um spatial salailability which
[24:45] is what you know KL Mega in you know
[24:48] father of Austrian economics uh talked
[24:51] about so yeah Bitcoin solves those
[24:54] problems I love that yeah I 100% agree
[24:57] with that it's the best of both worlds
[24:59] it's it's combining fear and gold kind
[25:02] of together and also have some even some
[25:06] values from from real estate and other
[25:07] store values if you look closer but um
[25:10] coming back to coming to the question
[25:12] that I had about uh you being a lawyer.
[25:15] How do you actually look at all those
[25:18] tokens and securities and altcoins um
[25:21] that are kind of generated with with
[25:24] pumped on fund and and all those meme
[25:26] coins? Um from from a law perspective um
[25:30] we as as like a Bitcoin maxi like like
[25:33] myself um we are sometimes very quick in
[25:36] calling them a scam and calling them oh
[25:38] like like why do you give your money to
[25:40] them? I mean there like levels to that.
[25:42] There's like Ethereum, Kadano, but then
[25:44] there's like real like complete meme
[25:46] coins that that don't even have they
[25:48] don't even try to to give give any any
[25:51] utility. Not questioning like I also
[25:53] don't see the utility of other alcoins,
[25:56] but at least Ethereum and Kadana,
[25:58] they're kind of trying to give some
[25:59] utility. Um how do you look at some of
[26:02] the meme coins and and project that are
[26:05] just starting out? the the kind of um
[26:09] getting money from from the open market
[26:11] without registrating for with the
[26:13] security exchange commission. I mean uh
[26:16] I think Gary Gensler was his name who
[26:19] kind of tried that but now with Trump
[26:21] coming in his own token this kind of
[26:24] vanished now. How do you look at that?
[26:27] Yeah, I can't say too much about that.
[26:29] But I mean, I'll just say that I think
[26:30] there's
[26:32] um the the the distinction that most
[26:35] people don't get, which is what I
[26:38] earlier explained, is money versus
[26:41] everything else. And I don't think
[26:43] there's been any, you know, if anyone
[26:46] tells you that Cardano is the next uh
[26:48] you know, uh we're going to move on to
[26:50] the Cardano standard or the Ethereum
[26:53] stand, you know, that's just that's
[26:54] nonsensical. But sure, they they you
[26:57] know, I I I don't I'm not going to
[26:59] comment on on the utility of of those uh
[27:02] of those tokens. In terms of regulation,
[27:04] I mean, I'm a big believer in the free
[27:05] market. If someone wants to trade
[27:07] something, go ahead and trade it. You
[27:10] know, if you lose money, then you learn
[27:11] the hard way. And um you know, that's
[27:15] just how that's just how kind of the law
[27:18] of the jungle works, right? Um I have
[27:21] nothing against people going to the
[27:23] casino and spinning spinning the
[27:24] roulette wheel. So if you want to trade
[27:26] some
[27:27] memecoin, go ahead and do it. I, you
[27:30] know, that's not for me to decide. I
[27:33] don't think it's for the state even,
[27:34] frankly, to decide what you can and
[27:37] can't be doing. I mean, that's that's
[27:38] for people to exercise their own
[27:40] independent judgment and um, you know,
[27:43] make make an investment decision. Um,
[27:47] so, so I'm I'm all for the free market,
[27:50] um, sifting out these bad actors and,
[27:54] and sure, some people get burned along
[27:55] the way, but that's just how how life
[27:57] is, you know.
[27:59] I like that answer because it's it's
[28:02] actually a journey that I've went
[28:04] through uh where before I started the
[28:07] podcast I was only on Twitter and I was
[28:11] really I don't want to say toxic but I
[28:13] was really aggressive against all the
[28:15] altcoins and now I'm just saying h like
[28:19] I don't care about them they they can do
[28:21] whatever they want and I I just focus on
[28:23] Bitcoin only. Um and I went through that
[28:26] uh journey because of free market
[28:30] uh of the free market um learnings and
[28:33] lessons that I had with awesome
[28:35] economics and everything because I was
[28:36] like Bitcoin is the ultimate winner in a
[28:39] free market. So if we make sure we have
[28:42] the freest market possible, Bitcoin will
[28:45] win out against everything else. So, I
[28:48] should never argue for a regulatory uh
[28:53] body to crack down on uh crypto or
[28:56] altcoins or shitcoins, whatever you want
[28:58] to call them, because
[29:00] that makes the market less free. And I
[29:04] think Bitcoin will be the the winner in
[29:06] a free market. So, I should always argue
[29:09] for a more free market. And it's sad
[29:12] that people lose money in in crypto
[29:14] schemes, but it's also their fault. It's
[29:16] their money. like if they are over 18
[29:18] years old and and they make with their
[29:21] own money their own decisions like
[29:24] like it's life. Let's take a break for a
[29:28] moment and appreciate the beauty that
[29:30] coin vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[29:33] watches. Those watches are the most
[29:36] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[29:39] that you are a true Bitcoiner. and Coin
[29:42] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[29:45] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[29:48] watch collections. You have the date of
[29:51] the first ever minded Bitcoin block in
[29:54] there and of course also the block
[29:56] height and which epoch we are currently
[29:59] in. I love the level of detail they put
[30:02] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[30:05] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[30:07] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[30:10] love those watches. so so much. And now
[30:13] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[30:16] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[30:18] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[30:20] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[30:22] first way is you put it on a hardware
[30:24] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[30:27] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[30:30] BitBox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[30:33] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[30:36] if you check out the link in the
[30:38] description, you even get 5% off if you
[30:40] use the code Robin. And the second way
[30:43] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[30:46] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[30:50] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[30:52] They will personalize for you a
[30:55] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[30:57] your individual situation. They will
[31:00] show you how you can secure your own
[31:03] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[31:05] enough. You also have to keep all your
[31:07] devices secure. One topic that is
[31:09] overlooked often is the inheritance
[31:12] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[31:15] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[31:17] a plan for that in place already? And
[31:20] last but not least, if you're in a
[31:21] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[31:24] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[31:27] that, head over to the
[31:30] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[31:33] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[31:36] be for the first time ever speaking at
[31:39] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[31:41] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[31:44] really looking forward to seeing all of
[31:46] you there. You can get your ticket in
[31:48] the link down in the description of
[31:51] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[31:53] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[31:57] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[31:58] there. Yeah. And and and the issue is
[32:01] when when the state intervenes and and
[32:04] you have this nanny state of trying to
[32:06] curate everything and all that, people
[32:08] stop thinking for themselves and then
[32:10] they look for somebody else to blame
[32:12] when in fact you're the one to blame. If
[32:16] you if you if you didn't uh you know
[32:19] exercise the you know the you know the
[32:22] necessary judgment and and do the
[32:24] necessary work before you invested your
[32:26] money, you're the one to blame. you have
[32:28] to take responsibility for your actions
[32:30] rather than try to blame somebody else.
[32:32] So yeah, that's just how I look at it.
[32:36] posed a really interesting question when
[32:37] you explained how you how you went ahead
[32:40] and uh wrote the book with the holistic
[32:43] view and the different angles and uh I I
[32:45] heard in actually in in a German
[32:47] speaking area really interesting um
[32:50] presentation on Bitcoin from Florian and
[32:52] he went ahead and I think he took like
[32:54] 30 minutes and went through different
[32:56] professions and different people and how
[32:59] they look at Bitcoin and he came up with
[33:01] a different explanation for them for
[33:03] each different perspective. So it's
[33:05] super interesting uh how many different
[33:09] angles and perspectives and ways to
[33:12] explain Bitcoin is but then the question
[33:15] is like uh what is the holistic view of
[33:17] Bitcoin? Like what is the bigger picture
[33:19] of all of that combined? That that
[33:22] that's super interesting. So I I like
[33:23] that you posed that question. How did
[33:25] you go ahead and and um kind of answered
[33:28] that in in the book and how did you kind
[33:30] of what is kind of your your conclusion
[33:32] to that? Yeah. So, so um the first thing
[33:36] is I think in terms of mental models um
[33:39] I argue that the easiest mental model if
[33:43] you were to do an elevator pitch right
[33:45] the 30 secondond how do you like what is
[33:47] Bitcoin you know sort of just 30 seconds
[33:49] how do you explain it and it's a
[33:51] difficult thing to do because as as you
[33:54] know there's never existed anything like
[33:55] it there's nothing automatically to
[33:57] relate it to and and so the problem is
[33:59] because there's nothing to relate it to
[34:00] people try to fit a square peg in a
[34:03] round hole
[34:04] and and then it just doesn't work. But
[34:06] but I think one model that kind of works
[34:08] is is the is the most famous well-known
[34:11] model which is digital gold.
[34:14] And you know it's funny. I mean there's
[34:16] as you said there's there's so much
[34:17] that's been written about Bitcoin now.
[34:19] There's volumes and volumes libraries of
[34:21] explanations on what it is and like
[34:24] thousands of hours of podcasts and and
[34:26] and uh you know recordings. Um, but it's
[34:30] quite interesting that almost all the
[34:33] questions about
[34:35] Bitcoin are answered in some way by
[34:38] Satoshi's original emails or you know
[34:42] sort of his messages and and my all-time
[34:45] favorite quote of Satoshi is is is is
[34:48] that particular uh email where he talks
[34:51] where he says as a thought experiment um
[34:54] imagine uh uh you you have a dull gray
[34:58] do you know that on a dull gray metal.
[35:01] Um, it's not malleable. It's not uh, you
[35:05] know, you you it's not uh, you know,
[35:09] shiny or beautiful like gold or anything
[35:12] like that. But it has one special
[35:14] property which is that it can be trans
[35:17] transported across a communication
[35:20] channel. Right?
[35:23] So that is Bitcoin and I think that is
[35:26] the perfect explanation of Bitcoin. So
[35:29] if you think about Bitcoin as literally
[35:32] a
[35:33] rock and and I and I and I have this
[35:35] thought experiment in the book where I
[35:38] talk about oh just imagine a a meteorite
[35:41] like this rock lands on Earth um from
[35:44] another galaxy another constellation in
[35:47] outer space that entire galaxy has now
[35:50] been devoured by a black hole. Right? So
[35:53] this last remaining rock is the only
[35:56] fragment that exists in the universe.
[35:58] you'll never have more of this
[36:00] particular rock. And you have it here
[36:02] now on Earth. And and the rock has all
[36:05] these magical properties. Um for one, it
[36:09] can be divided into a quadrillion
[36:13] equallysized, you know, particles. Um
[36:16] you can take the particles and if you
[36:18] like whisper a magic word to it, it
[36:21] becomes invisible. You can hand the
[36:24] particle to somebody else. You can throw
[36:26] the particle to someone on the other
[36:28] side of the planet and they just reach
[36:30] out and they catch it, right? Um, and
[36:33] it's invisible. Nobody can see it. It
[36:35] just kind of you can transport it
[36:37] without anybody confiscating it. Do you
[36:40] think that that rock would have any
[36:42] value? And if you ask some sort of, you
[36:45] know, person who doesn't know anything
[36:46] about Bitcoin, they probably say, "Yeah,
[36:48] that seems like a pretty amazing uh, you
[36:50] know, kind of uh, magical rock from
[36:54] outer space." and and and it's uh and
[36:56] it's scarce. It's absolutely scarce as
[36:58] well. Would that be of any value? It
[37:00] would absolutely be of
[37:02] value. That is literally what Bitcoin
[37:05] is, right? Um it is completely
[37:09] peer-to-peer. It is, you know,
[37:12] dematerialized. You can transfer, you
[37:14] know, transport it in a if you're being
[37:16] persecuted by a authoritarian state, you
[37:19] can move across borders without anybody
[37:21] knowing that you're
[37:23] carrying potentially millions of dollars
[37:25] or more, you know, in your in your mind.
[37:29] So, so I sort of argue that that that is
[37:31] actually a really helpful mental model,
[37:34] like kind of almost like a very first
[37:36] principles-based explanation for what
[37:38] Bitcoin is. It's a physical. It's kind
[37:41] of like the the invention. What was the
[37:43] invention? The invention
[37:45] was the creation of a
[37:49] material
[37:50] that you know is is is a a physical
[37:54] material that lives on the internet. Um
[37:59] yeah. So so that that I think is is is
[38:01] is the best explanation that I could
[38:03] come up with for for what Bitcoin is.
[38:07] And um and and so I I in addition to
[38:10] that I sort of I say that but but you I
[38:13] mean you have to understand it from
[38:15] different realms. You have to if if you
[38:17] just focus on the price alone and the
[38:20] economics of it you miss the political
[38:22] implications. You you miss what a
[38:24] censorship resistant permissionless
[38:27] asset does in an authoritarian state you
[38:30] know sort of in in Iran or North Korea
[38:33] Venezuela. what how you know what a
[38:35] lifeline it gives um populations in in
[38:39] in those parts of the world. If you
[38:42] focus only on its political aspects
[38:45] without understanding the technology
[38:47] that gives it censorship resistance and
[38:50] permissionlessness and unf
[38:52] unconfiscability, then you'll think, oh,
[38:54] some government is going to shut it
[38:55] down. It's pointless. It's a, you know,
[38:57] fool's error, right? And equally, if you
[38:59] focus just on the technology without
[39:02] understanding the philosophy and the
[39:03] politics and the economics of it, then
[39:06] you're going to think, oh, this is
[39:07] outdated technology. I'm going to move
[39:09] on to the next, you know, faster
[39:11] blockchain or whatever, right? If you
[39:13] don't understand all these other aspects
[39:15] of it. So, that's why you need to look
[39:17] at it holistically to really get it. Um,
[39:21] yeah, it it makes total sense and it's
[39:24] it's a it's a great comparison to make
[39:27] people understand that Bitcoin is the
[39:30] best way to communicate communicate
[39:32] value across space and time. And that's
[39:35] basically what what money should be. You
[39:38] want to communicate value across space
[39:41] and across time and that like those two
[39:43] things have to be perfect or close to
[39:47] perfect or the best thing that we
[39:49] currently have and at that time Bitcoin
[39:52] is that and the great thing is that 99%
[39:56] of the people haven't figured it out. So
[39:58] you can capitalize on 99% of the people
[40:01] figuring it out in the next uh 10 20 100
[40:04] years. Yeah. Yeah. I mean it's it's one
[40:07] of the greatest in someone wrote I don't
[40:09] if it's Alex Gladstein or maybe someone
[40:12] else um it's one of the
[40:13] greatestformational
[40:15] asymmetries you know the if you look
[40:20] at the the knowledge that Bitcoiners
[40:23] have people who understand Bitcoin and
[40:25] and are proponents of Bitcoin have about
[40:27] it compared to the knowledge that
[40:31] Bitcoin skeptics have it's a vast
[40:35] asymmetry. you know, I' I've never met a
[40:38] person who can truly explain to me, you
[40:42] know, the difficulty adjustment or or or
[40:45] you know, like even the difference
[40:46] between a minor and a and a node runner.
[40:50] Um, who is also like a a really really
[40:55] uh like a like a like a real skeptic of
[40:57] Bitcoin. It's um it's very very rare to
[41:01] see that. And so that's like a that's a
[41:03] major asymmetry.
[41:05] I've actually never like I've never met
[41:07] the person that actually understands
[41:09] Bitcoin and has no agenda against
[41:11] Bitcoin and still is critical against
[41:13] Bitcoin. Like if you have no agenda and
[41:16] you have um uh and you're informed about
[41:19] Bitcoin, you almost have to be be at
[41:22] least positive uh towards it a little
[41:25] bit. Yeah. Yeah, I mean some people who
[41:28] who've just kind of u sold the bottoms
[41:31] of
[41:32] cycles, they they tend to also be so
[41:35] even if they truly understand it, they
[41:38] uh they can't accept that they lost so
[41:41] much money on it. I mean, it's painful
[41:42] if you if you bought Bitcoin at 30,000,
[41:45] sold it at
[41:46] 16,000, sold it all at 16,000, and then
[41:50] you watch it go back up to 100,000, it's
[41:52] a painful experience.
[41:55] But I would say if you truly understand
[41:58] Bitcoin, you wouldn't sell.
[42:00] [Music]
[42:01] Yeah, that's I think I think that's
[42:03] that's that's a fair point. But but you
[42:05] can understand it enough to know what a
[42:07] node is and a minor is and what is the
[42:09] difficulty adjustment and all of that
[42:11] but not really really get it and again I
[42:13] think it comes down to the holistic
[42:15] perspective right you can understand
[42:16] these little things the technology of it
[42:19] you know over a weekend but to
[42:22] understand the the full picture takes
[42:24] takes a lot more time. Absolutely. And
[42:27] it and it's also painful if you bought
[42:30] the top and sold the bottom and then you
[42:34] still watch the asset. You still maybe
[42:36] consume one or two podcasts and books
[42:38] and then you're like the the the price
[42:41] keeps rising and it's like not 60k
[42:43] anymore. It's like 50k or like 60 or 70k
[42:46] and and and you're like more and more
[42:48] like oh like I I shouldn't have
[42:51] sold. Like I now more and more
[42:53] understand the the thing and then it's
[42:54] like at 110k and you're like oh
[42:56] Yeah. Yeah. Again, yeah, it comes back
[42:58] to are you do you have the humility to
[43:02] accept that? Yeah, you got it wrong.
[43:05] Absolutely. Yeah. Really interesting.
[43:08] How do you look actually at uh this this
[43:10] bull market? It's it's fascinating for
[43:12] me that we have so much great news, but
[43:15] the the price is kind of disappointing.
[43:17] Again, we are recording that on like
[43:19] 22nd of May. um uh when this comes out
[43:22] it's probably like middle of June so
[43:24] that the price might be not as
[43:26] disappointing anymore or more
[43:27] disappointing. Let's see.
[43:30] Um yeah, look I I think it it uh you
[43:34] know all these charts and I think you
[43:36] know technical analysis TA is just
[43:39] astrology. Um I I don't attribute any
[43:43] value to to technical analysis but I do
[43:46] think that M2 supply M2 money is
[43:49] probably
[43:51] out of all the indicators, I think that
[43:52] is the most reliable indicator. Um, and
[43:55] and the lagging M2 supply, I think, is a
[43:58] pretty pretty reliable indicator. It's
[44:00] not just Bitcoin, it's all asset prices,
[44:01] right? It's a stock market. I I don't
[44:04] see a scenario, at least for the time
[44:06] being, where
[44:08] um there's a complete decoupling of of
[44:11] Bitcoin from other risk assets simply
[44:13] because, like we discussed, 99% of the
[44:16] world doesn't understand it. So, you
[44:18] know, for a while to come, people will a
[44:20] lot of people, a lot of money will
[44:22] continue to trade it as if it's a risk
[44:24] asset. There's no there's no getting
[44:26] around that. It just I mean, learning
[44:28] takes time, adoption takes time. So, uh
[44:32] so I I think it'll continue to trade in
[44:33] that way. So, so if you follow M2
[44:35] supply, I think it's broadly following
[44:37] it's it's on track. I mean, it's uh
[44:39] there's been a spike in M2. Bitcoin is
[44:42] now starting to catch up um to that. So,
[44:45] so, so yeah, I I think it's all as per
[44:48] schedule. Um, I I don't think it's uh
[44:51] really that much out of whack. Um, it's
[44:54] just it's just about patience. I think
[44:56] you just have to um, you know, kind of
[44:57] wait for the process to unfold.
[45:00] We before talked about how much we can
[45:02] learn from the early Satoshi emails and
[45:06] I know we we we don't know who Satoshi
[45:08] is and and it's it's kind of hard to
[45:10] think of like what he would have think
[45:12] about Bitcoin right now but what do you
[45:14] think is your best guess like what what
[45:16] Satoshi would say how satisfied or
[45:19] dissatisfied he would be with the
[45:20] current developments of Bitcoin? I I say
[45:22] he's you'd be extremely satisfied,
[45:24] right?
[45:25] Um there's uh there's you know Alan
[45:30] Farington. Have you read Bitcoin is
[45:33] Venice?
[45:34] I did not read that. Um it's it's a good
[45:38] book, but there's there's this I'm I'm
[45:40] probably going to butcher it, but
[45:41] there's this uh I think he ends the like
[45:43] one of the chapters with with this. He
[45:46] says um like what I think there's two
[45:50] people talking about um the sun you know
[45:53] the earth going around the sun and
[45:55] someone says you know are you sure the
[45:57] earth goes around the sun revolves
[45:59] around the sun it doesn't seem like the
[46:01] earth is revolving around the sun and
[46:04] the other guy asks him what do you think
[46:07] it would seem like if it seemed like the
[46:10] earth was going around the sun and you
[46:12] know that's like it would it would seem
[46:14] exactly like this right? This is how it
[46:16] would seem. So if you ask yourself what
[46:18] would it seem like if an asset a brand
[46:24] new technological innovation was
[46:27] monetizing from absolute zero to become
[46:31] you know the global reserve asset. What
[46:34] would it look
[46:35] like? It might look a lot like this.
[46:38] It's going to be volatile. The process
[46:40] is going to be slow. It's going to be
[46:41] misunderstood, misconstrued.
[46:45] But the march of adoption will continue.
[46:50] Um so so yeah I think I think uh Satoshi
[46:54] would be quite pleased with the way
[46:57] things have panned out. I do think so uh
[47:01] too. And it's interesting because we
[47:04] when we think about the the earth is
[47:06] around the sun or the sun is around the
[47:08] earth. It's like when you stand on Earth
[47:11] because it's going up and down, you
[47:13] think it's like, oh yeah, like it's
[47:14] obvious. It's the sun is around the
[47:16] earth. Um, but then you look deeper. And
[47:19] the same thing with with Bitcoin. The
[47:21] first thing is like, oh, like it it uses
[47:22] so much energy. It goes up and down so
[47:24] much. It's volatile. Like why would you
[47:26] like it's only for gamblers if if if you
[47:28] look out from the outside and you don't
[47:30] look deeper. But then you look deeper
[47:32] and you're like, "Oh, there's there's
[47:34] more. Oh, it's actually perfect money."
[47:36] So you have to look deeper at things and
[47:38] longer at things before you really get
[47:40] it. Especially if something is new
[47:42] coming. So I think I I love the the the
[47:44] sun analogy also a lot.
[47:49] Yeah. Um and it's also the like another
[47:53] thing that I talk about in the book is
[47:55] this um is is foundational inventions.
[47:58] And I think this comes back to your the
[48:00] point about Bitcoin versus altcoins.
[48:03] um the if you take you know what is a
[48:06] found a foundational invention is an
[48:09] invention that's complete from inception
[48:13] so the wheel for example is a
[48:15] foundational
[48:16] invention right there was no I mean you
[48:19] can have different materials or you know
[48:21] you can have it in wood or steel or
[48:25] rubber or or something else but the
[48:28] wheel is you know the of you know an
[48:30] axle and and wheels is is the same
[48:32] principle that you see every single
[48:34] vehicle, you know, running on the road.
[48:36] It's it's a foundational invention. The
[48:38] the magnetic compass is also a
[48:40] foundational invention. But you compare
[48:42] that to, for example, the automobile,
[48:45] right? You had the first um automobile.
[48:49] I think Carl Benz in Germany created a
[48:52] prototype and then and then Ford created
[48:55] the assembly line and then you know
[48:57] you've had all sort of iterations over u
[49:00] decades culminating in electric cars and
[49:04] self-driving cars and and and so on.
[49:07] Um or and similar to that you take like
[49:10] you know the light bulb or or um or
[49:14] um uh the the you know smartphones or
[49:18] computers and so on like they just
[49:19] they're constantly evolving right they
[49:22] were never complete at the time of
[49:24] invention. So which category does does
[49:27] Bitcoin fall into? Is it a foundational
[49:29] invention like the wheel or is it like
[49:33] the automobile? And many people think
[49:35] and this has been a big problem since
[49:38] 2009. They thought that this was just
[49:40] the initial starting point blockchain
[49:42] technology and then all these things
[49:44] it's going to evolve and you know get
[49:45] built on and and and so on like the
[49:48] automobile or like
[49:50] computers. They don't realize that the
[49:53] underlying concept which is digital
[49:55] scarcity is a one-time invention. It is
[49:59] the wheel not the automobile.
[50:02] Um, and I think that is something that
[50:06] again goes to differentiate Bitcoin from
[50:08] all the other things in crypto, right?
[50:11] Um, sure, maybe they they're going to
[50:13] serve purposes and I'm sure like I mean
[50:15] stable coins I think is the most um, you
[50:18] know, valuable innovation to come out of
[50:20] the crypto ecosystem. Um, and there may
[50:24] be others. I'm not dismissing any of
[50:26] that. Um
[50:29] but that that all of that is
[50:31] fundamentally different from the
[50:34] foundational invention that is digital
[50:36] scarcity and that is Bitcoin. And I
[50:38] think that is a that that's a
[50:40] distinction that is is lost on most
[50:43] people and and so I've tried to explain
[50:45] that um in my writing. I love that. I
[50:48] never heard the term
[50:51] foundational innovation in that context.
[50:54] I I really like that from inception it's
[50:56] complete and therefore it's it's
[50:59] fundamentally different to the
[51:01] smartphone or social media or all those
[51:03] things. It's it's more like the TCPIP
[51:05] protocol or like the wheel. I love the
[51:07] wheel comparison because it's like the
[51:09] wheel uh never really changed. It just
[51:13] got uh different things on top of it.
[51:15] And maybe this is comparable with the
[51:17] layer tool uh where where it it says
[51:20] different versions of it. Yeah. I mean
[51:22] sure like there's this is not to say
[51:24] that you know you should not be I mean
[51:27] there will be changes I mean um all this
[51:30] uh you know sort of OP return and all
[51:32] these conversations that are ongoing of
[51:35] course we'll most likely need a soft
[51:36] fork to address quantum computing at
[51:38] some point in the over the next few
[51:40] years. Um, but the core innovation is
[51:45] digital
[51:46] scarcity and and that goes so much
[51:48] beyond. It's nothing. It's not just some
[51:51] lines of C++ code, right? It's
[51:54] everything else. It's the it's the um,
[51:58] you know, 100,000 plus nodes around the
[52:00] world, the billions of dollars of mining
[52:03] equipment distributed around the world,
[52:05] the decentralization at multiple levels.
[52:07] It's the adoption that's taken place.
[52:10] It's the network effects. It's the Lindy
[52:12] effect. All of that coming together is
[52:14] what makes it digitally scarce is that's
[52:17] what contributes to the 21 million
[52:19] digital scarcity. The incentive
[52:22] structure around um and and that's what
[52:24] makes it that's what sets it apart from
[52:25] everything else. I love that. Um I also
[52:29] saw that I think Alex Gladstein wrote
[52:31] the the the forward for for for your
[52:34] book if I remember correctly. Um and he
[52:38] does tremendous work of the impact of
[52:42] Bitcoin from outside the financial
[52:45] aspect of outside of the the number go
[52:48] value side and more of the social impact
[52:50] of that Bitcoin has how do you look at
[52:52] the the impact that that Bitcoin will
[52:55] have outside of yeah you probably get
[52:57] wealthy from it. Yeah know so that's
[53:00] kind of like like I said that's the the
[53:02] political side of of my explanation. You
[53:05] have to understand that to understand it
[53:07] holistically. Um, and you're right. I
[53:09] mean, I if you go to most people and
[53:12] tell them if you if you use human rights
[53:15] and Bitcoin in the same sentence, they
[53:18] look at you like you're from outer
[53:19] space. It's just it would make no sense
[53:21] to them,
[53:22] right? So, so that that was the reason
[53:25] why I I I asked Alex Gladstein to to
[53:28] write the forward because he's, you
[53:29] know, chief strategy officer at the um
[53:32] Human Rights Foundation and this is what
[53:33] he does. So, I wanted I like I'm I'm
[53:35] sure it shocks a lot of people to see
[53:37] someone from the human rights world
[53:39] write a forward about uh Bitcoin, right?
[53:43] But I wanted people to I wanted that uh
[53:45] you know um but yeah, I I think
[53:48] personally I think that is its biggest
[53:52] um its most impactful aspect will be the
[53:54] human rights cycle. In fact, I and I
[53:56] think the the relationship between
[53:59] violence, war, and Bitcoin is one of the
[54:02] most underappreciated aspects of
[54:04] Bitcoin. Right? If you look at the
[54:07] history of conflict, all wars have been
[54:10] for fought over either, you know,
[54:13] defense or trying to acquire physical
[54:16] property, physical resources. you know
[54:19] the the the resource curse is a term you
[54:22] might have heard like you know parts of
[54:23] the world that were had abundant
[54:26] resources have been the the greatest
[54:28] victims of conquests right you take um
[54:32] Africa India and so on European
[54:33] conquests and you know South America and
[54:35] so on it's always been humans in you
[54:39] know seeking physical wealth physical
[54:42] resources that have has resulted in
[54:44] violence perpetration of of of terrible
[54:47] acts of violence throughout history for
[54:49] tens of thousands of years now. What
[54:52] happens if you dematerialize property,
[54:55] right? And you you you make it this is
[54:58] something that Trace Meer actually the
[55:00] first time I heard this was from Trace
[55:01] Meer where he says that you know you
[55:04] make it uneconomic. It's just it's just
[55:07] there's no there's no return on
[55:08] investment if you uh you know you invest
[55:12] in trying to take away or sort of you
[55:14] know conquer somebody else and take
[55:16] their property because it's impossible
[55:18] now. Um what does that do to society
[55:22] civilizations?
[55:24] Um, I think it remains to be seen and I
[55:26] think it's going to
[55:27] be tremendously impactful. Just the the
[55:31] the simple
[55:32] dematerialization of of physical
[55:35] property I think is is profound.
[55:39] Yeah, I think
[55:41] we I think it's really hard to see the
[55:44] full impact of Bitcoin in that regard
[55:47] because it
[55:49] is we we are so early in the first 15
[55:53] years of this revolution. And if you
[55:55] just think back of the first 15 years of
[55:57] of anything, you have no clue what the
[56:01] next 15 20 years will bring. When we
[56:04] look uh at when the kind of the first
[56:06] internet protocols and the first
[56:08] connected networks came across let's say
[56:11] 1990 or or that that era you had no clue
[56:16] that 20 years later there's like a
[56:19] YouTube there is uh zooming around
[56:22] around the world there's Google that
[56:24] makes it easy and then zoom another 15
[56:28] years later we have now AI that where
[56:32] you can speak towards And it it it is
[56:36] like an a personal assistant that knows
[56:38] everything about the world and is
[56:40] actually really good in digesting
[56:42] information and helping you with with
[56:44] tasks. And uh then
[56:47] then take this and take another 15 years
[56:50] out. Uh I it's scary how how fast those
[56:54] those things really develop. And because
[56:56] we are in the moment, it's really hard
[56:58] for us to understand how quick this
[57:00] actually is happening because it seems
[57:02] slow. But look, look at the AI videos of
[57:05] Will Smith two years ago eating
[57:08] spaghettes. And look at the AI videos
[57:10] that Google just released this VU model
[57:13] and it's freakingly good. Like it is
[57:16] that is movie material that that you can
[57:19] do now with AI. Just look in five years.
[57:24] You have no clue if that's AI Robin or
[57:26] real Rob in that sense. Yeah, like you
[57:28] have just no way of knowing because AI
[57:29] is so good. I can guarantee you that
[57:31] already. It will be a really fun time
[57:33] for content creators. Yeah, I know. It's
[57:35] Yeah, 100% 100%. Yeah. And and and it's
[57:39] uh that's why I think um Bitcoin is a
[57:42] very interesting counterpoint to AI in a
[57:44] in a world where you're not going to
[57:46] know what is real in the digital realm
[57:49] of ones and zeros. Here you have
[57:52] something that you can hold on to which
[57:55] you can actually trade as if it were
[57:57] physical
[57:58] property yet in the digital realm. Um is
[58:03] is that very interesting
[58:06] um counterpoint to to u to AI. I also
[58:11] it's really interesting when you think
[58:12] about an AI a post AI world or like an
[58:16] an an actual AI world where you can copy
[58:21] anything and it looks super real. We
[58:25] will have to make somehow sure how to
[58:29] verify that this is from a real person.
[58:31] And I think real person things will be a
[58:34] lot more valuable than than anything
[58:36] else because people really probably uh
[58:40] they probably will get so sick from all
[58:42] the AI content that the human content
[58:45] and the human touch of things will be so
[58:48] freaking valuable because it's like such
[58:50] a small portion of the overall internet.
[58:53] So it I'm I'm just so I'm just so
[58:56] grateful though to be alive at that very
[58:58] time. Honestly, it's like AI, Bitcoin,
[59:02] and there's like a thousand other things
[59:03] that I'm excited about. Yeah. Yeah. No,
[59:06] 100%. I know. I think I think AI is is
[59:08] going to Yeah. You know, sort of you're
[59:11] not going to be able to trust anything
[59:12] that you see online. And and that's such
[59:14] a big shift from you know you know this
[59:18] old sort of thing like you know post a f
[59:21] post a photo or it didn't happen you
[59:23] know that used to be a a thing right um
[59:26] but now it's yeah posting a photo
[59:28] doesn't mean it happened no value
[59:31] whatsoever so we've moved into that you
[59:34] know it's it's I was thinking about this
[59:36] the other day you go back before the
[59:39] internet and and you know the digital
[59:41] era of sharing photos and so And we
[59:44] lived in darkness. You know, the world
[59:46] was kind of in a because you couldn't
[59:47] see. You had to get physical analog
[59:50] photos, mail sent to you in the mail and
[59:52] you don't know what your, you know, your
[59:54] your family members or your friends are
[59:56] doing in another part of the world or
[59:58] whatever, you know, sort of it was kind
[59:59] of a dark place to be, right? Um because
[60:03] you couldn't see uh things through to
[60:07] digital photography. And now we went
[60:10] through this, you know, 20 plus years of
[60:13] Instagram and seeing all these amazing
[60:15] things, amazing photos and and seeing
[60:17] what was happening around the world. And
[60:19] now we've in a weird way come back to
[60:21] darkness again because you cannot trust.
[60:24] You see all these things, but you don't
[60:26] know what is real. So it's a weird kind
[60:28] of paradoxical uh thing. It's like we're
[60:31] going to be cast once again into
[60:32] darkness in in not being able to trust
[60:35] anything that uh that is online.
[60:39] Yeah. And in a weird way, it it might
[60:43] really value up the physical experiences
[60:46] like going we I think we talked about
[60:48] before we we're going to the to the
[60:51] Vegas conference and and it's like you
[60:54] you really value those because this is
[60:57] like a true way of knowing, hey, this
[60:59] person is real. Maybe at some point the
[61:01] robots can be so freaking good that you
[61:03] don't even know in in in real life.
[61:05] Wait, are you are you even real? like
[61:08] like how how do you prove that? I don't
[61:11] think hardware so they you know they say
[61:13] that uh people always um overestimate
[61:17] the speed at which hardware gets adopted
[61:20] and underestimate the speed at which
[61:22] software gets adopted. So so hardware I
[61:25] I don't think robots are just suddenly
[61:27] going to take over everything because
[61:28] it's hardware. It's physical. You need
[61:30] to roll out. You can't just produce like
[61:32] a million robots and roll them out,
[61:34] right? Whereas software you just create
[61:37] something you know copilot and every
[61:41] single uh you know
[61:43] Microsoft uh PC on the planet has
[61:47] copilot installed right that that is the
[61:50] speed at which software can be adopted.
[61:52] So we always underestimate that and
[61:53] overestimate hardware. So I I don't
[61:55] really see robots taking over the world
[61:58] but certainly uh you know everything
[62:00] online is going to be changed very very
[62:03] radically. Yeah, that's that's very
[62:06] true. I have one question to ask each
[62:08] and every one of my guests and the
[62:09] question is what can we learn from you
[62:11] besides Bitcoin? Well, I'm I'm a lawyer
[62:14] uh and I'm um I'm a structured finance
[62:18] derivatives uh person. That's what I've
[62:20] done for the last 20 years. So if you
[62:22] want to learn about what happened in the
[62:26] 2008 financial crisis, you know, the big
[62:28] shot, if you want to understand, you
[62:30] know, the movie pick the big shot and
[62:32] and you know, sort of the book as well
[62:33] about that by Aaron Sen. Um, yeah, I can
[62:37] talk about that because I was there and
[62:38] I did that stuff myself. So, so that's
[62:41] um yeah, pretty cool. Um, we have
[62:43] entertain I mean this is this the the
[62:46] big short is always super interesting
[62:48] because there's so many um I think the
[62:51] the movie for example the the big short
[62:53] is is kind of a Bitcoiner movie for me.
[62:56] It's always like when you're a Bitcoiner
[62:58] you're like oh it's relatable. Yeah. I
[63:01] think the
[63:02] Matrix and and the Big Shot are you know
[63:05] maybe the top two Bitcoin Bitcoin movies
[63:08] maybe V for Vendetta as well maybe.
[63:11] Oh man, I haven't seen that. I have to I
[63:13] have to look at that. I think some
[63:15] people already mentioned that V for more
[63:17] of a cipher punk kind of world thing.
[63:20] It's not necessarily uh you know it's
[63:23] um yeah you know V for vendetta is the
[63:26] uh guy uh you know sort of the you know
[63:30] the mask the yeah that it's it's it's
[63:34] Natalie Portman. It's a good movie.
[63:36] Yeah, if you watch it. Awesome. Perfect.
[63:38] Then we have an entertaining the podcast
[63:40] as you probably know where the previous
[63:42] guest is asking a question for the next
[63:43] guest without knowing who the next guest
[63:44] actually is and the previous guest asked
[63:46] you the question what's one way that
[63:48] Bitcoin can change the world that most
[63:51] people don't talk about. You know it's I
[63:54] think it's the one I just talked about.
[63:55] I think the the impact on war and
[64:01] violence that arises from the
[64:04] dematerialization of property I think is
[64:07] the most underestimated aspect of
[64:10] Bitcoin. Nobody talks about it. People
[64:12] talk about inflation, sure, store of
[64:15] value, sure.
[64:18] Um but
[64:20] um you know whatever peer-to-peer
[64:22] transfers, privacy and all those things
[64:25] sure but I think far more important far
[64:29] more impactful I think will be its
[64:32] impact on literally on wars and and on
[64:35] violence. I think that is that yeah
[64:38] that's kind of how power I would see.
[64:39] Yeah, it's it's something that it's not
[64:42] on top of the minds that get into
[64:44] interested in Bitcoin because they see
[64:46] this the number go up technology. They
[64:48] see like, oh, I get wealthy or I've I've
[64:50] saved uh €4,000 now. I have like 6,000
[64:52] and and those smaller things. Um but
[64:57] this ending or limiting physical wars
[65:00] and having something immaterial and also
[65:04] the thing that you can have it yourself
[65:08] and people can show up to your house and
[65:11] you can still not give it to them. So
[65:14] you you can set it you can set Bitcoin
[65:17] up in a way no matter with like maybe
[65:20] time locks or multi signature or however
[65:21] you do it that people can break in your
[65:24] house and can can torture you and can
[65:28] and you can say to them you can kill me,
[65:30] you can torture me, but one thing I
[65:32] cannot do is give you my Bitcoin because
[65:34] I've set it up in a way that I just
[65:36] can't. So, so super sorry to say and
[65:39] this is completely changing the way of
[65:41] like hey you can hold a lot of wealth
[65:45] and secure it in your own way and be
[65:48] safe with that and that that's that's
[65:51] like it's freaking awesome. Yeah. And
[65:53] it's it's just good privacy practices.
[65:55] You don't be going around telling people
[65:56] and and you can actually legitimately
[65:58] lose your Bitcoin, right? I mean, if you
[66:00] actually even if you're not doing the
[66:02] boarding accident like pretending to
[66:04] have lost it, it is so easy to lose your
[66:07] like a piece of paper or your private
[66:08] keys and you've lost your Bitcoin. And
[66:10] so, nobody can really kind of you're the
[66:13] only one who actually knows whether or
[66:15] not you have your Bitcoin. you know,
[66:17] it's and and that's a very very uh you
[66:20] know, paradigm shifting
[66:23] um you know, concept um from okay, you
[66:26] know, here's my suitcase filled with
[66:28] gold that I have buried in my backyard,
[66:31] you know, and and if uh you know, you're
[66:33] you're under some kind of attack or you
[66:35] need to flee, um you can't you can't
[66:38] take it with you most of the time,
[66:40] right? So, in in my book, I have this uh
[66:42] this thought experiment. It's a whatif
[66:45] scenario. So what if you know you you
[66:48] run through different wars through
[66:51] history let's say the second world war
[66:52] what if the Jews had you know uh you
[66:56] know this kind of you know an invisible
[66:59] asset that they could just take with
[67:00] them across borders you know what what
[67:02] if people under Soviet uh communism had
[67:07] you know this kind of in unconfiscable
[67:09] censorship resistant way of transacting
[67:11] so yeah I
[67:14] Um, I
[67:16] think yeah, I'll leave it at that. Yeah,
[67:20] it's it's it's a really good one. I like
[67:23] that. Um, perfect. Then, thank you so
[67:26] much. Before I let you go, before um uh
[67:29] I can let you go uh where can people
[67:31] reach out to you and and and DM you and
[67:33] and and ask you questions? Um, I have a
[67:36] a Twitter account, so maybe that's
[67:38] that's the best. So, it's uh VJ
[67:41] Selmomx. That's the handle. Yeah.
[67:44] Perfect. Then thank you so much, VJ, for
[67:46] for taking your time. And also, thank
[67:47] you so much for everyone that is
[67:48] watching and listening for joining us
[67:50] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
[67:52] with another episode. Bye-bye.
