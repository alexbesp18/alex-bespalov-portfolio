[00:00] Bitcoin is the base layer of the economy
[00:02] and AI is basically the base layer of
[00:05] all economic activity and our engagement
[00:08] with each other and with commerce. What
[00:10] is Bitcoin? Singularity is the point at
[00:12] which Bitcoin exceeds all other
[00:14] economies, all other fiat, all other
[00:16] things we know and becomes, you know,
[00:18] the most powerful base layer of our
[00:20] economy, but also converges with AI and
[00:23] the singularity of AI. And what does
[00:25] that look like? And it won't take long
[00:27] for AI to say, no, I only accept payment
[00:29] in Bitcoin. Fiat was the problem, not
[00:31] capitalism. So, I could stay with my
[00:34] mindset of capitalism and not move
[00:36] beyond it. My colleagues don't know
[00:37] anything about Bitcoin, like nothing.
[00:39] And they're professors in a business
[00:41] school. I start with something around,
[00:43] you know, well, here's why Bitcoin is
[00:44] better than fiat. And his very first
[00:47] question, what is fiat? And in the end,
[00:49] fiat is going to see its demise, and I
[00:52] think sooner rather than a lot of people
[00:54] [Music]
[00:58] expect. Before we get started with the
[01:00] with the topics, maybe give the viewers
[01:03] some background who you are and and why
[01:05] you're excited about Bitcoin.
[01:07] So, I'm from the US. I haven't lived in
[01:09] the US since 2001. I've lived in I think
[01:13] nine countries now, either in Western
[01:16] Europe or in the Americas, sort of North
[01:18] and South America. Currently living in
[01:20] Mexico. Uh had like every one of us in
[01:23] the Bitcoin space had my own journey. uh
[01:26] you know one of the first things that
[01:28] happened to me that's memorable is I
[01:30] lived in Argentina and part of this life
[01:32] journey moved there in 2012 right when
[01:34] they implemented currency controls it
[01:37] was a disaster obviously Argentina has
[01:39] experienced hyperinflation you also see
[01:41] a high adoption of crypto and bitcoin in
[01:43] Argentina and stable coins because of it
[01:46] but that was sort of predated all that
[01:48] but uh I had my first experience living
[01:51] in a developing country that experiences
[01:53] hyperinflation and currency controls and
[01:56] how it affects your life in dramatic
[01:58] ways. And in fact, we we lived there in
[02:00] 2012 and by 2013 we moved cuz we
[02:03] couldn't deal with it. It was, you know,
[02:05] I for for your listeners who aren't
[02:06] familiar with it, give you some examples
[02:08] of some of the things that happened to
[02:09] us. We couldn't send money. I couldn't
[02:11] send money to family in other parts of
[02:12] the world because the government had to
[02:14] approve if you send any money anywhere.
[02:17] Um, I couldn't take money out of an ATM
[02:20] outside of the country without previous
[02:23] uh government permission. So when I
[02:25] traveled, I couldn't get access to my
[02:27] money. The currency controls made it so
[02:31] that you know they started to experience
[02:33] hyperinflation
[02:34] uh for multiple times by the time we
[02:37] were living there. And
[02:39] the businesses tried to charge people in
[02:42] dollars because of it. But dollars were
[02:45] hard to come by. And they had this
[02:46] market they called the blue market or
[02:48] dollar blue. And you had to go to these
[02:51] like sketchy little stores in the middle
[02:55] of nondescript areas and go and bring
[02:59] Argentine pesos and get dollars to go
[03:01] pay your rent and everything. And you
[03:03] know, as an American who believes in
[03:05] freedom and liberty, that was extremely
[03:08] shocking to my core that I don't
[03:10] actually this money isn't really mine
[03:12] and I can't do what I want with it when
[03:14] I want it. You fast forward, I got into
[03:17] crypto in
[03:18] 201617. Um, but more not not for
[03:22] gambling or betting or anything. In
[03:24] fact, I didn't even buy crypto when I
[03:26] got into crypto. I got into it for the
[03:29] decentralization narrative and believing
[03:32] that we could build a, you know, the
[03:34] Ethereum view of the world, sort of a
[03:36] decentralized world computer. And I I
[03:40] mistakenly thought that the problem with
[03:43] the loss of the middle class and you
[03:45] know the occupy movement that emerged in
[03:48] the states and everywhere else that they
[03:50] were right to be upset but I thought the
[03:52] reason they were upset. I thought the
[03:54] underlying core problem was capitalism
[03:57] had gone arry and I have a PhD in
[04:00] business. I'm a capitalist by nature.
[04:02] I've written three or four books that
[04:04] have the title capitalist in it. And yet
[04:06] I started to question capitalism. And I
[04:09] thought crypto and blockchains could
[04:11] solve
[04:12] that. And then only in the last year and
[04:15] a half did I come to realize I had
[04:17] misdiagnosed the problem. That it wasn't
[04:20] capitalism. It was fiat. It was the
[04:22] money that was causing all these
[04:24] problems. And even though I have all
[04:26] these degrees and I've taught in
[04:28] business schools and all the rest of it,
[04:30] it I didn't know. I didn't understand
[04:32] until the last 18 months. And as I got
[04:35] deeper and deeper down the rabbit hole,
[04:36] I went from appreciating Bitcoin to
[04:39] acquiring some Bitcoin, but still
[04:41] holding some other crypto over the last
[04:43] year and a half. And then by I think it
[04:47] was November of last year, I rotated
[04:49] everything out of anything else and put
[04:51] it all in Bitcoin. And I've been like
[04:53] that since then.
[04:55] I love that. So you you went all in. Uh
[04:57] I I love that a lot. Um maybe before we
[05:00] get to to the Bitcoin, why did you flee
[05:03] uh USA? Were you uh just like getting
[05:05] out there or like was there a specific
[05:07] reason? That's a good question. I don't
[05:10] think I felt in the moment I was fleeing
[05:12] it per se. I I have this wandering
[05:15] spirit and I wanted to live in other
[05:17] parts of the world and I knew that there
[05:19] was a bigger world out there. I'm not an
[05:20] ethnosentric guy and know a lot of
[05:22] Americans are. I I'm not. And uh you
[05:26] know I had previous exposure to Europe
[05:28] uh from when I finished my master's
[05:30] degree. I spent a semester in Copenhagen
[05:32] and it opened my eyes so much to a
[05:35] different world traveling by train and
[05:38] the culture and the history and I loved
[05:40] so much of Europe and just felt more
[05:42] European in my spirit and you know there
[05:45] are a lot of things I didn't like about
[05:47] the US then and to be honest a lot of
[05:49] Bitcoiners probably be offended by
[05:50] things I'll say right now but that's all
[05:52] right. Um there's a lot of things I
[05:54] still to this day do not like about the
[05:56] US and have not had you know a calling
[05:59] that I have to live there again. I'm not
[06:01] opposed to it but you know there's you
[06:04] know historical problems around u
[06:06] discrimination and not against me but
[06:08] you know racial discrimination etc. Um I
[06:12] don't like being so car dependent. Uh
[06:15] you know I got used to Europe and I
[06:17] lived nine years in Barcelona. I didn't
[06:19] have a driver's license. I I rode my
[06:21] bike to the train. Took the train. If I
[06:23] needed to be in a car for something, I
[06:26] could take a taxi, no problem. My wife
[06:28] had a car, so of course we could go
[06:30] places together in her car, but with my
[06:32] daughter and everything. But um I really
[06:36] like that lifestyle that Europe offered
[06:38] and and I still do and there's some
[06:40] things I still prefer about Europe, but
[06:42] when it comes to Bitcoin and CBDC's, not
[06:45] so much. Would you say is the European
[06:47] lifestyle outside of politics and the
[06:50] political system and CBDC's uh more
[06:53] Bitcoiny like more more on the golden
[06:55] age side? Oh, that's an interesting way
[06:58] of of reflecting it. Yes and no. I mean,
[07:02] I certainly would say I personally
[07:05] prefer the lifestyle of Europe better as
[07:07] a Bitcoiner or not as a Bitcoiner. I
[07:10] like that you're not car dependent. I
[07:11] like that you have great rail
[07:12] infrastructure and you know mass
[07:14] transit. I like the way the cities are
[07:17] built that are more dense. I like
[07:19] walkability. Walkability is huge for me
[07:21] and that's you know there's people in
[07:23] the Bitcoin community that are all
[07:24] bragging about you know how many
[07:25] kilometers or miles they walk every day
[07:27] which is an amazing thing and I'm all
[07:29] for it and I do the same thing and I but
[07:31] when I lived in Europe it was a lot
[07:32] easier for me to do it. I now live in
[07:34] Monterey Mexico which feels a lot like
[07:36] the US. In fact they want it to be like
[07:38] the US. So it's extremely car dependent.
[07:41] Um so that stuff I don't like. As far as
[07:43] it being more Bitcoiny outside of the
[07:45] public policy, I think you know what US
[07:48] still has that you don't really find
[07:49] that much in many other countries is the
[07:52] true embracing of freedom of liberty of
[07:56] um you know the world's your oyster. You
[07:59] can build anything you want. um you
[08:03] can nothing limits you except your own
[08:07] imagination your own capacity to to to
[08:09] be an entrepreneur to build something
[08:11] and that part is much more of an
[08:13] American mindset and I also feel like
[08:15] that's also highly aligned to a Bitcoin
[08:17] value it's you said you studied like you
[08:20] wrote three books that had the title or
[08:24] capitalist in the in the title how would
[08:26] you define capitalism and is Bitcoin
[08:29] kind of enabling real And true cap like
[08:32] I think
[08:33] um when we say capitalism it's a word
[08:36] that gets thrown around a lot and thrown
[08:40] around a lot in wrong ways. I think even
[08:43] though I'm I'm not an expert on it. I'm
[08:45] not I did not study it or anything like
[08:47] that. I just feel like oh like how can
[08:49] we have capitalism if capital itself is
[08:52] not not not not free with with the fiat
[08:55] system and and those things. Is is
[08:56] Bitcoin then the true capitalist system?
[08:59] So that's I think part of my journey to
[09:02] becoming a toxic Bitcoin maximalist
[09:05] myself was a recognizing that fiat was
[09:07] the problem not capitalism so I could
[09:10] stay with my mindset of capitalism and
[09:13] not move beyond it. So one of my books
[09:14] was called postc capitalist
[09:16] entrepreneurship and it was in response
[09:17] to the occupy movement and and that's
[09:20] when I first started diving into bitcoin
[09:22] or blockchains in in particular and
[09:24] crypto and everything else. That was
[09:26] like 2016 and 17. Um but in my in
[09:30] hindsight as I you know reflect now on
[09:32] my journey my intellectual journey and
[09:34] where I see the world today I would say
[09:36] absolutely that fiat is the problem.
[09:40] Bitcoin is the solution. Bitcoin can be
[09:42] can enable the ultimate expression of
[09:45] capitalism where you truly have free
[09:47] movement of labor goods and money sound
[09:52] money. And you know, one thing that's
[09:54] interesting, I wrote about it briefly in
[09:56] my intro to my book, is that um
[09:59] Schumpeder is an Austrian economics. I
[10:02] don't know if you've come across
[10:03] Schumpeder, Joseph Schumpeder. No,
[10:06] actually not. So he's by some people
[10:10] considered the father of
[10:12] entrepreneurship in terms of like
[10:15] economic academic thinking about what
[10:17] entrepreneurs do. And Schumpeder talks
[10:20] about creative destruction and how in
[10:22] truly perfect market. So he's basically
[10:25] trying to explain how is it if you have
[10:27] perfect markets that are assumed in
[10:31] capitalist um and economic principles.
[10:35] Then why are there these windows of time
[10:38] when some entrepreneurs able to extract
[10:41] exorbitant
[10:43] profits? Because presumably in the
[10:46] freedom of a free flow of information,
[10:48] goods, economy, etc. There is no
[10:52] information asymmetry, everybody knows
[10:54] everything. They're all omnisient and
[10:56] then therefore there is no way to
[10:58] actually profit and and have exceptional
[11:01] margins. And he was the sort of the
[11:05] driver of this understanding that what
[11:07] entrepreneurs actually do in truly free
[11:10] markets, capitalist markets in their
[11:12] most purest form, is that they uncover
[11:15] things that no one else has discovered
[11:18] yet. And they're able to
[11:21] create through creative destruction is
[11:23] what he called it. They creatively
[11:25] destruct our current understanding
[11:29] of through the information we have. They
[11:33] they detect information asymmetry that
[11:35] no one else has identified yet. And so
[11:38] they're able to exploit an information
[11:40] asymmetry that no one knows about yet.
[11:42] They capitalize on it. But in true
[11:46] capitalist behavior, anytime it becomes
[11:48] now known that there is this margin
[11:51] opportunity, others will come to it and
[11:53] they'll compete away the margins. And so
[11:55] the the best entrepreneurs basically
[11:57] have to be on this continuous cycle of
[11:59] creative destruction of what we know as
[12:02] um the information we use that we think
[12:05] is is perfect information, but it's
[12:08] flawed. So yeah, in that context, I
[12:11] think when you combine Schumpeder from
[12:13] the Austrian school um with Bitcoin and
[12:17] the rest of our understanding of
[12:19] capitalism, I think then you get the the
[12:21] perfect outcome or closer to it. That's
[12:24] super interesting. I like the the way of
[12:27] looking at it. So you you kind of like
[12:29] an entrepreneur is a adventurous guy
[12:33] that or girl that that just like
[12:35] searches something uh and once he
[12:39] discovers something he can make a lot of
[12:41] margin but as soon as it's discovered
[12:45] other people will be like hey that's a
[12:46] great opportunity will go in and then
[12:48] the competition is lowering the margin
[12:51] for all of them till it's a commodity
[12:53] basically and it's like um barely
[12:55] profitable That's exactly what's
[12:58] happening with Bitcoin treasuries right
[12:59] now. You could argue, right? So, so
[13:02] clearly Michael Sailor, he he got he he
[13:05] got the conviction as an individual. He
[13:07] recognized a window and opportunity to
[13:09] to deploy that conviction he had not
[13:11] just in privately acquiring Bitcoin, but
[13:13] also in in in turning his company into a
[13:16] Bitcoin treasury company. He started in
[13:18] 2020. It's been an evolution and because
[13:20] of regulation, because of other things,
[13:21] he's been able to really capitalize on
[13:23] it. Now a whole bunch of people are
[13:25] coming into the market to do the same
[13:27] thing. Unlike the way Schumpeder
[13:30] envisioned it, though this is a
[13:32] fascinating thing I don't think I've
[13:33] ever witnessed before and I'm not sure
[13:35] we'll ever see it quite like this again
[13:37] outside of the world of Bitcoin. I mean
[13:39] you could argue in open source some of
[13:41] these values apply but I've never
[13:45] seen a scenario where a schumped like
[13:49] disruptive creative destruction thing is
[13:52] happening
[13:53] and the the individual who had that
[13:58] information asymmetry and took advantage
[14:00] of it instead of hoarding that knowledge
[14:02] and keeping it so that he could extend
[14:04] the length of time he has this
[14:06] competitive advantage in the
[14:07] marketplace. He's willingly, publicly,
[14:10] and aggressively sharing it with anyone
[14:13] and anyone who wants to listen and adopt
[14:15] the same model. Now, you could say he's
[14:17] doing
[14:18] that because only it benefits him
[14:21] because in this scenario, Bitcoin is
[14:25] uniquely developed in a way that aligns
[14:27] all stakeholders in the same journey.
[14:29] And so, it's in his best interest for
[14:31] others to do it because it increases the
[14:32] value of his company. But I think it's
[14:34] even more than that. It is that, but
[14:36] it's more than that. and and that I
[14:38] think it'd be interesting to hear
[14:39] Schumpeder's take on this behavior in
[14:41] the Bitcoin world because it isn't what
[14:43] you would have seen in historical
[14:45] capitalist
[14:47] markets. I guess it's also about
[14:50] branding in in the way that like when he
[14:52] is so outspoken about it, he builds a
[14:56] brand and brands usually can charge a
[15:00] premium on top of something that is is a
[15:03] commodity. I mean like the like shoes
[15:06] that are made for like five bucks, you
[15:08] can buy them for like a hundred bucks or
[15:10] something like that. Um and and um what
[15:14] he is doing with strategy B might have
[15:17] some really interesting
[15:20] future implications. What he's doing in
[15:23] 50 years with that company, I mean um
[15:26] what the company is doing in in 50
[15:28] years. uh because they build a brand of
[15:30] being the Bitcoin company, Bitcoin
[15:32] treasury company, being maybe like a
[15:35] service provider for other businesses
[15:36] and stuff like that. So, um it it it's
[15:40] really interesting uh watching strategy
[15:42] with Michael Sailor and and seeing that
[15:44] firsthand is like, wow, like that's that
[15:47] that that's incredible. Um I always
[15:50] underestimated that company every year.
[15:52] I've never been invested. Never in I had
[15:55] Michael Sailor, the CEO and the
[15:57] chairman, now no longer CEO um on my
[16:00] podcast, but I still never bought a
[16:02] single share of micro strategy. Uh
[16:04] probably one of my bigger bigger
[16:06] mistakes the last year. Um so I've
[16:10] underestimated them from the very
[16:13] beginning. Uh and so I'm just amazed to
[16:16] to see how they well they execute that.
[16:18] And I'm also amazed how much how many
[16:20] bitcoin they can acquire. Like I'm like
[16:22] just shocked uh by by the amount of of
[16:26] Bitcoin they already got. Like we only
[16:28] have 21 million. How many do they got
[16:30] now? Like 500,000 something. 5,000.
[16:33] Yeah. Oh gosh. Yeah. Like my my last one
[16:36] was like 500,000.
[16:38] No company is going to ever overtake
[16:40] them in my opinion. Uh I think 21, if
[16:44] you ask me, 21 Jack Mullers might be the
[16:46] one that will give them the best run for
[16:48] the money so far. Now that's before some
[16:52] company like an Apple or Microsoft or
[16:54] Meta decide to enter because you know
[16:56] they could enter with force with the
[16:58] amount of capital they have on on the
[17:00] books plus what they could uh attract.
[17:03] But I still don't think so. I think you
[17:05] know they had that they had those years
[17:08] of acquiring in smaller amounts when no
[17:10] one else was doing it at much lower
[17:13] valuations. I think I saw the data. I
[17:16] think their average um Bitcoin purchase
[17:19] is something like 67,000 out of the
[17:22] 565,000. And now we're, you know, we're
[17:24] approaching double that value now. And
[17:26] so we we you and I know and all your
[17:29] listeners know where the price of
[17:30] Bitcoin is going to go over time. And so
[17:32] how is it possible somebody else could
[17:34] get? And also Sailor and Strategy aren't
[17:37] stopping. It's not like, okay, they have
[17:39] 565,000, they're happy, they'll be done
[17:41] with that. No, they're going to keep
[17:42] growing, too. So, how does anyone The
[17:45] next highest has like 45,000 Bitcoin.
[17:48] So, he has more than 10x the next
[17:50] largest uh player in the space. I just
[17:53] don't think anyone will catch them. That
[17:55] that's a mode that's going to be almost
[17:56] impossible to catch. They will
[17:58] absolutely going back to your point
[18:00] about brand
[18:01] building. I I could be wrong, but I
[18:05] don't actually think sailors doing this
[18:07] as much for brand building. um including
[18:12] his work to engage other CEOs to get
[18:14] them to adopt. I was at the the Strategy
[18:17] World uh Bitcoin for Corporations
[18:20] conference in Orlando just you know less
[18:21] than two weeks ago at the time of
[18:23] recording.
[18:24] Um and you know he's sharing the stage
[18:27] sharing the the spotlight with all the
[18:30] other CEOs. When you watch him on
[18:32] Bitcoin Twitter he's promoting all these
[18:34] other CEOs and and and I think he means
[18:37] it.
[18:38] When you have the level of conviction
[18:39] you and I and everyone else we know has
[18:41] in the Bitcoin space around
[18:43] Bitcoin, you want other individuals,
[18:47] other institutions, other companies,
[18:49] other actors to also share in the future
[18:51] of this network together. And it isn't.
[18:54] I mean, I used to when I used to
[18:56] interact with toxic Bitcoin maxis, I
[18:58] thought they were pumping their back.
[19:00] And that was one of the reasons it took
[19:01] me longer to become a Bitcoin maxi
[19:03] myself is, you know, as somebody who's
[19:06] academically trained up through PhD. I
[19:08] have a tendency to want to be more
[19:11] objective about things and and and even
[19:13] though I am very passionate about things
[19:15] too, but I want to have my knowledge be
[19:17] based on sound reasoning and logic and
[19:20] and not just influence because a bunch
[19:23] of people say I have to do it. And I
[19:25] used to think that these toxic
[19:27] maximalists were doing it because they
[19:29] were pumping their bags. But it's not.
[19:30] When you get that deep into it and you
[19:32] have that level of conviction and you
[19:35] see what's coming and you see the
[19:37] Titanic is going underwater and you have
[19:40] any empathy for
[19:42] humanity, do you want to convince the
[19:45] world to see what we see before it's too
[19:49] late? And I honestly feel that Sailor's
[19:52] conviction to Bitcoin is that. and his
[19:54] conviction to getting other companies on
[19:56] board is the same. Like, hey, if you
[19:58] don't have Bitcoin on your balance
[20:00] sheet, you're probably going under
[20:02] sooner or later and your shareholders
[20:03] are going to pay the price for it. So,
[20:05] why don't you get on board? I mean,
[20:07] Sailor knows that whether Semler or 21
[20:10] or Mara or anybody buys more Bitcoin,
[20:13] Bitcoin's going up forever, Laura, and
[20:16] it will go up with or without them. So,
[20:19] I don't think he's doing it as a
[20:20] self-serving thing. I think he's doing
[20:22] it as a true Bitcoin uh maximalist. I
[20:26] 100% agree with that. Even though I
[20:28] think he he's he's uh building brand
[20:31] without maybe knowing it and
[20:33] intentionally like he's he's definitely
[20:35] uh brought the strategy discussion in so
[20:39] many Bitcoin conversations which wasn't
[20:41] there before. Um but I don't think his
[20:44] uh his intentions is there at all. Um,
[20:47] and one of the uh interesting things I'
[20:51] I've forgotten now where I was going. Oh
[20:52] [ __ ] Uh, oh yeah, I was going with
[20:55] Micro Strategy because I think it was
[20:57] the perfect size and the perfect moment.
[20:59] Like he had the the majority control of
[21:01] it and it was not a huge company. Like
[21:04] is a huge company, but it's not an
[21:06] Apple. It's not a Meta. It's not an
[21:09] Alphabet, which allowed him to not pump
[21:12] the price. Because if now Apple comes in
[21:15] and says, "Oh yeah, we will acquire some
[21:17] Bitcoin." The price doubles tomorrow. I
[21:19] don't know like what happens, but the
[21:21] price really rips. If if a player like
[21:24] Apple, Alpha Bet, or Meta comes in and
[21:27] says, "Uh, let's convert like five or
[21:29] 10% of our uh portfolio of our cash
[21:33] reserves into Bitcoin as an alternative,
[21:36] even if they're really conservative and
[21:38] uh almost uh like very protective in the
[21:41] wording, how they say it.
[21:44] I I can guarantee you that the price
[21:45] will rip like this. This is an whole no
[21:48] matter when this happens. So this is
[21:50] another aspect of if a player comes in
[21:53] with enough capital, they the price is
[21:56] is going to rip away and they they might
[21:58] never get to the micro strategy
[22:00] position. I think that's the problem.
[22:02] either because of their brand or just
[22:05] the capital they have, it would be hard
[22:07] for a major player to come in and and
[22:10] acquire as much as they as Sailor has at
[22:12] at Strategy. I think we're going to see
[22:16] big plays happen. I think you we might
[22:19] see the way to do it would be like
[22:23] through a private vehicle like imagine
[22:28] Apple
[22:29] and Nubadala the um sovereign fund out
[22:33] of Abu Dhabi that's been stocking and
[22:36] buying Bitcoin either directly or
[22:37] through ETFs. I think imagine I don't
[22:40] know I'm just making this up. Apple and
[22:42] Mubadala decide to join forces and
[22:44] create a separate entity under some kind
[22:46] of unknown brand. Maybe not even go
[22:50] public with it anytime soon because as
[22:52] soon as they go public, they're going to
[22:53] be disclosed. It's hard. You can't disc
[22:55] you can't go public without disclosing
[22:58] who your shareholders are. So, be a
[22:59] little bit complicated. But what if you
[23:01] did under a private umbrella and nobody
[23:04] knows who you are and you're just
[23:05] quietly stacking. The other thing I
[23:07] think we might
[23:08] see, it's tricky especially when you see
[23:11] the MNABs the way they are, you know,
[23:13] the multiple of net asset value and
[23:14] they're over two, but like I think
[23:16] you're going to see some M&A activity in
[23:18] this space. Like imagine
[23:20] if what if
[23:23] Apple realized what's going on? I think
[23:27] they have some I can't remember the
[23:29] number, but I think I remember reading
[23:30] somewhere they have something like $800
[23:31] billion in cash. Well, Strategy's
[23:34] currently worth somewhere, you know, in
[23:37] that in that genre. They have uh No,
[23:41] they're they're worth way less than
[23:43] that. Sorry. They're worth about 60
[23:44] billion right now. No, they're worth
[23:46] about 100 billion right now, I think.
[23:47] Yeah, they're 100 billion right now.
[23:49] Market
[23:50] value. What if Apple say, you know what,
[23:52] we're just going to buy strategy,
[23:55] hostile takeover, and immediately they
[23:57] have, you know, closing on 600,000
[24:00] Bitcoin. something like that's going to
[24:02] happen. Of course, what would happen is,
[24:04] you know, that would be a hostile
[24:05] takeover and the share price would go up
[24:07] through the roof and there'd be a lot of
[24:09] uh counter strategies executed to try to
[24:12] avoid being acquired that way. But, you
[24:14] know, sometimes there's ways to kind of
[24:16] do it stealthily um to do that. We'll
[24:19] see what happens. But you know
[24:20] eventually this is going to be a war of
[24:22] whoever has the most Bitcoin has moes
[24:24] that are going to be impossible to
[24:26] overcome later for the reason you said
[24:27] that it's going to be hard hard if not
[24:29] impossible for anyone else to ever
[24:31] acquire that kind of Bitcoin. So we'll
[24:33] see be fun times to watch how it all
[24:35] unplays over time. Absolutely 100%. I
[24:39] think like the the host Bitcoin as the
[24:43] digital scarcity where this is the only
[24:45] thing that we cannot make more of and
[24:47] everyone wants. It will be freaking
[24:49] awesome to explore this and see this the
[24:52] next 20 years. Um I want to go uh back
[24:56] to your Argentina and and and go to
[24:58] hyperinflation a little bit. How did you
[25:00] see this hype inflation firsthand? Why
[25:04] are those people that see hype inflation
[25:07] still aren't like in masses into
[25:10] Bitcoin? I see most of them are then
[25:12] going towards a better fiat currency
[25:14] which is like the US dollar or Turkish
[25:17] LRA or like maybe the U not Turkish LRA,
[25:20] Turkish L is also going to the US dollar
[25:22] and other ones. But I see for example uh
[25:25] in in Egypt they all took the euro and
[25:27] they were really glad that uh they took
[25:30] the euro and not the Egypt uh I don't
[25:32] know how it's called the Egypt currency
[25:35] there. So it's like uh they go to a
[25:38] better fiat currency and not opt out of
[25:41] the bad system and go to the actual real
[25:43] system.
[25:45] You know, I had a it's an interesting
[25:47] I'm going to give you a response you
[25:49] might not be expecting, but um this
[25:52] weekend I spent the we had a a cookout
[25:55] with my daughter who's 13. Her best
[25:58] friend and her parents and her they're
[26:01] that family is Argentine. I live in
[26:03] Monterey, Mexico, but they're Argentine.
[26:05] The guy's a CFO of a publicly traded
[26:07] company. And it's the first time I've
[26:10] ever met him, even though we've
[26:11] interacted, but we never sat down,
[26:13] talked about anything. So, he didn't
[26:14] know anything that I was into Bitcoin.
[26:16] And of course, like all toxic
[26:17] Bitcoiners, I ended up talking about
[26:19] Bitcoin a lot. And um what's interesting
[26:23] because he's
[26:24] Argentine, when we started talking about
[26:26] it, he's like the first thing he said
[26:29] was, "I'm not that much of a believer in
[26:32] Bitcoin, but I am a believer in other
[26:34] crypto." And I'm like, "Oh my god, is
[26:36] that like how did that happen? I did not
[26:39] expect that outcome." Well, then and
[26:41] then I'm like, "Uh, okay. what other
[26:44] crypto and I was expecting Solana or
[26:47] something. He's like stable coins. And I
[26:49] started connecting the two and two,
[26:51] right? Because that's what's happening a
[26:53] lot in these hyperinflating economies,
[26:55] including in Argentina, is that they're
[26:57] seeking out stable coins because they're
[27:00] clearly less hyperinflationary than
[27:02] their local
[27:04] currency. And the thing that I think we
[27:06] need to recognize is there are a lot of
[27:08] barriers still to trying to live on a
[27:10] Bitcoin standard. I know you're pretty
[27:12] close. You're, you know, pretty far down
[27:15] the path. Uh, but you live in a modern
[27:18] economy where and you're, you know, a
[27:20] professional uh, white collar guy in in
[27:22] in Austria. You're not, you know, living
[27:25] in a developing economy where, you know,
[27:27] not even everything is digitized yet for
[27:30] transactions and everything. They still
[27:32] rely on cash and all kinds of stuff. And
[27:34] in in countries like Argentina, like
[27:37] when I lived there, like the story I
[27:39] told about the the blue um they called
[27:41] it the dollar blue, which was like this
[27:44] uh black market um version of getting
[27:48] dollars when you live in Argentina when
[27:50] you're going through this
[27:52] hyperinflation. Um those are so
[27:54] powerful. having dollar or dollar
[27:56] equivalent is so powerful in a
[27:58] hyperinflating economy because the US
[28:00] dollar looks so stable compared to the
[28:03] alternatives and that's what people
[28:05] really are seeking out and it's easier
[28:07] to transact in stable coins and convert
[28:10] them to currency than it is Bitcoin in a
[28:13] lot of these markets and in retailers
[28:15] and all the rest. So I think you know
[28:16] some of it is infrastructure some of it
[28:18] is knowledge and understanding. you do
[28:21] get way more receptivity to talking
[28:23] about Bitcoin with someone in a
[28:25] hyperinflating economy. The problem you
[28:28] have in a lot of these economies though,
[28:29] besides the lack of infrastructure, is
[28:31] that you also have the issue
[28:33] around the volatility of Bitcoin. So,
[28:37] you know, if you're using stable coins
[28:40] as a alternative to your fiat for your
[28:44] daily
[28:46] life and your daily life, it's hard to
[28:48] live on a Bitcoin standard anyway. And
[28:50] even if you tried, one day the food is
[28:53] more, one day it's less, and you're
[28:55] barely surviving already, you don't want
[28:57] to take that extra risk that maybe
[28:59] tomorrow Bitcoin goes down five or 8%
[29:02] because that's actually going to affect
[29:03] your your livelihood more than the fact
[29:06] that the US dollar in stable coin or not
[29:09] is inflating at, you know, roughly real
[29:11] world six, seven% a year. that's way
[29:14] more manageable for them if they're just
[29:16] trying to survive their daily life than
[29:18] the volatility of Bitcoin. Now, if
[29:21] they're thinking about it as a savings
[29:22] technology, which I don't run across
[29:24] that many people in hyperinflating
[29:26] economies that necessarily think about
[29:29] stable coins as a saving technology as
[29:31] much as like preservation of short-term
[29:35] capital technology. And of course, it's
[29:38] certainly superior saving than their
[29:41] local fiat, but I think they're trying
[29:43] to get to some stability first and
[29:46] usually are rarely in a situation to
[29:48] feel like they have disposable income to
[29:51] to put away for saving. And therefore,
[29:53] the stable coin is something they can
[29:54] more easily transact in on a in micro
[29:57] payments and in local commerce than
[30:00] Bitcoin. So, I think that's why it's not
[30:02] as adopted in those markets as you'd
[30:04] think. Let's take a break for a moment
[30:07] and appreciate the beauty that coin
[30:09] vigilante has made with the Bitcoin
[30:12] watches. Those watches are the most
[30:15] amazing, the most elegant way of showing
[30:18] that you are a true Bitcoiner. And Coin
[30:21] Vigilante just dropped a completely new
[30:23] and amazing Genesis edition of their
[30:27] watch collections. You have the date of
[30:29] the first ever mined Bitcoin block in
[30:32] there and of course also the block
[30:35] height and which epoch we are currently
[30:38] in. I love the level of detail they put
[30:41] in in this masterpiece. Make sure to
[30:43] check out those amazing coin vigilante
[30:46] time pieces down in the descriptions. I
[30:49] love those watches so so much. And now
[30:52] if you have Bitcoin, I really do hope
[30:54] that you don't have it on exchange. But
[30:56] if you do have it on exchange, I have
[30:58] two ways for you to deal with that. The
[31:00] first way is you put it on a hardware
[31:03] wallet. That's the entry for you to get
[31:06] into the self-custody game. I recommend
[31:09] Bitbox Bitcoin only edition for that.
[31:12] It's a super simple and secure way. And
[31:15] if you check out the link in the
[31:16] description, you even get 5% off if you
[31:19] use the code Robin. And the second way
[31:22] is the Bitcoin way. The Bitcoin way is
[31:25] your all-in partner in terms of how to
[31:28] get the most out of your sovereignty.
[31:31] They will personalize for you a
[31:33] self-custody setup that is perfect for
[31:36] your individual situation. They will
[31:39] show you how you can secure your own
[31:41] devices. Securing your Bitcoin is not
[31:44] enough. You also have to keep all your
[31:46] devices secure. One topic that is
[31:48] overlooked often is the inheritance
[31:50] plan. What happens with your Bitcoin
[31:53] once you are no longer here? Do you have
[31:56] a plan for that in place already? And
[31:59] last but not least, if you're in a
[32:00] jurisdictions where you don't feel safe,
[32:03] it's better to get a plan B. For all
[32:05] that, head over to the
[32:09] bitcoinway.com/roin to get a 30inut free
[32:12] call. And just a quick side note, I will
[32:15] be for the first time ever speaking at
[32:17] the Bitcoin Prague event in June. It
[32:20] will be absolutely legendary and I'm
[32:23] really looking forward to seeing all of
[32:25] you there. You can get your ticket in
[32:27] the link down in the description of
[32:29] Bitcoin Prague. And very important, use
[32:32] code Robin to get 10% off your ticket.
[32:35] I'm really looking forward seeing you
[32:37] there. Do you think that stable coins
[32:40] actually accelerate the adoption of the
[32:43] US dollar across across the world? And I
[32:46] think now we have like 67 countries or
[32:49] something like that that use the US
[32:50] dollar as a as a legal tender. Um, do
[32:53] you think that kind of the stable coins
[32:56] actually hollow out all the other fiat
[32:58] currencies and kind of consume
[33:00] everything to maybe like one, two, three
[33:02] big players? Maybe like call it the
[33:04] euro, call it some something with China
[33:06] and then then the the US probably um I
[33:10] think you know it's a little early to
[33:12] see like the disappearance of fiats
[33:16] especially from more developed
[33:19] economies. Japan looks like it's in
[33:22] serious threat. Um so they they could be
[33:26] the first to get knocked out of this
[33:28] which would be fascinating but would
[33:30] create a contagion effect that would be
[33:32] concerning for the whole world. But in
[33:34] developing markets certainly you see
[33:36] that I think there's I don't know I
[33:38] don't know the data but I think it's
[33:39] something like 10 countries around the
[33:41] world use US dollar as legal tender. Not
[33:44] just it's allowed to circulate and some
[33:46] people use it, but like legal tenor you
[33:48] can pay your taxes in. Um I don't know
[33:51] if that number is growing that fast over
[33:54] like in in a near term, but the US
[33:58] dollar being adopted by the masses in
[34:01] these economies whether the government
[34:04] supports it or not for sure and and
[34:07] certainly stable coins is accelerating
[34:09] the adoption of the US dollar for that.
[34:11] There's a lot of discussion amongst the
[34:13] macroeconomist world around will sta US
[34:17] dollar stable coins extend the life of
[34:19] the dollar. Um you know are we going to
[34:22] see the dollar as you say becoming more
[34:24] of an adopted sort of legal tender in
[34:27] other countries? Are we going to see a
[34:29] regional play which you also kind of
[34:31] allude to like will you see sort of Asia
[34:34] form around the yuan the CBDC version or
[34:38] the normal one Europe with a euro and US
[34:41] and the Americas with the dollar. I'm
[34:43] not exactly sure what the short medium
[34:46] term is even though in my book I do sort
[34:48] of present out kind of my view of the
[34:51] future adoption of Bitcoin and how
[34:53] things will unfold. If you ask me what I
[34:55] think will happen, but I'm certainly not
[34:58] um
[35:00] convinced is that people think that US
[35:04] stable coins are going to extend the
[35:06] life of the dollar and and that it's
[35:09] going to save the US from the problem
[35:12] they have with treasuries. And from what
[35:15] I'm reading, I don't think so because
[35:17] what's really happening is like Tether
[35:19] and, you know, um, Circle, they use very
[35:24] short-term notes that have decent
[35:27] interest rates for the very, uh, near
[35:29] term when you're only holding them for a
[35:32] month or whatever. And they're way
[35:33] better than holding your money in a bank
[35:35] account because in the US, bank accounts
[35:37] generally have zero interest rates these
[35:39] days or almost zero. You can get a few
[35:41] percent for your more liquid money you
[35:44] want to have access to more quickly.
[35:46] Then putting them in a short-term
[35:48] treasury makes sense, but that's not
[35:50] going to solve the US's larger problem
[35:52] with their own dollar with their own uh
[35:54] sovereign debt crisis, which is getting
[35:56] worse and worse by the day. So, it's an
[35:59] interesting thing to see how it all
[36:00] unfolds, but I don't think we're going
[36:02] to see. I used to think the US dollar
[36:04] was going to be the last to go and was
[36:06] going to be extended greatly by the
[36:09] growing adoption of stable coins, but
[36:10] now I'm not so convinced. I think we're
[36:12] going to see it buy them a little bit of
[36:15] time, but we have to see what the US
[36:17] does around everything else they're
[36:18] trying to do in the macro environment to
[36:20] sort of reset the economy. But, you
[36:22] know, they're in like 36 37 trillion
[36:26] debt. Um, their growing uh deficit every
[36:29] year is is unsustainable. And I don't I
[36:32] don't see a path out for them either. I
[36:34] ju I just uh because I was curious, I
[36:37] just Googled that apparently eight
[36:39] countries have US dollar as their only
[36:42] legal tender. But more interestingly, 66
[36:45] nations have their currency packed to
[36:48] the US dollar, which like then at that
[36:50] point you basically have the US dollar
[36:52] if you pack the currency uh to to the US
[36:55] dollar. So that that's that's
[36:58] something that's interesting. Like all
[37:00] like 66 nations is a lot of nations in
[37:03] in the in the world. How many countries
[37:05] are there? Like uh almost 200. So like
[37:08] there's like not a not a lot not a lot
[37:10] of nations already already left. Uh but
[37:14] yeah, it's it's super interesting. Just
[37:15] a very small weird side question. What
[37:18] is a cook out? You you mentioned that
[37:20] before. I I've never heard that. It's uh
[37:23] like when you grill out uh on a on a
[37:25] barbecue grill.
[37:27] Oh, okay. It's it's a it's a barbecue
[37:30] basically then. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, I know
[37:32] it as barbecue. A cookout. Interesting.
[37:34] I never heard that word. I I was
[37:36] googling it, but then there was like
[37:38] there was some some restaurant coming up
[37:40] and like okay
[37:43] um I want to go to to your book that you
[37:46] have been been writing and I think you
[37:48] already published it I think like in
[37:49] May, right? Um uh it was Bitcoin
[37:52] Singularities. Is that right? Yes. What
[37:55] is the the book about and and and what
[37:58] are you kind of trying to to message in
[38:00] the book?
[38:02] So you know I've read some of the other
[38:03] famous books in our in our ecosystem. Uh
[38:06] you know whether that's um Bitcoin
[38:08] Standard or Broken Money or um the big
[38:12] print and some of these others that you
[38:14] know are are classics that people need
[38:18] to read. pretty much all of them, you
[38:20] know, they they take a different
[38:22] approach to it, but they kind of all
[38:24] have a very macroeconomic finance base
[38:27] to the book and um they sometimes go
[38:32] super deep in it or sometimes try to
[38:34] stay more accessible to a larger
[38:36] audience. So for example, uh Lawrence
[38:38] Leopard Lipard is uh tries to make it
[38:41] sort of accessible finance topic around
[38:44] Bitcoin and and and fiat.
[38:47] uh but you know my if you look at my
[38:49] journey as a as a scholar as a writer
[38:53] and as a builder of of businesses as
[38:55] well I've always been interested in the
[38:57] intersection of technology with other
[38:59] things around society so I'm I'm very
[39:02] interested in sustainability renewable
[39:05] energy food etc and how we can
[39:08] accelerate through capitalist business
[39:11] models a path to a more prosperous
[39:13] abundant future that is inclusive for
[39:17] everyone. And that's basically been the
[39:19] journey I've been on for the last 25
[39:21] years is how can innovation and
[39:22] technology help us transform our economy
[39:25] to get to where I think we need to be,
[39:27] of abundance, of sustainability, of
[39:30] inclusive prosperity.
[39:33] And the Bitcoin singularity is about the
[39:36] role of Bitcoin in helping accelerate
[39:38] that transition to the future I think we
[39:41] all want. And it what does the world
[39:44] look like over what period of time? So
[39:47] it has a bit of a future orientation to
[39:49] it as well. So it has three phases. I
[39:52] have the bitcoinization phase which I
[39:54] consider that we're in right now which
[39:56] is basically through 2030. And that's
[39:59] basically early adopters, people like
[40:01] you and I and everyone else who are
[40:03] early to Bitcoin still um companies
[40:06] early stage government adoption. And
[40:09] then I have hyper bitcoinization which I
[40:12] say starts around 2030 when we start to
[40:14] see more pervasive ubiquitous access to
[40:17] bitcoin in more places more adoption in
[40:20] in a larger amount of the population
[40:22] etc. And then finally I say roughly
[40:25] after 2040 to 2050 and beyond we could
[40:28] get to what I call bitcoin singularity
[40:30] and that is a point I describe as where
[40:33] we have bitcoin is basically the base
[40:36] layer of our global economy. So the
[40:38] layer one of Bitcoin, the money of our
[40:41] future
[40:42] economy and the ethos and well I should
[40:45] say one more thing. The layer twos
[40:48] basically empower
[40:50] uh all the other economic models or
[40:53] other business models that aren't
[40:54] directly related to the base layer of
[40:56] money. They happen on the layer two of
[40:58] Bitcoin. And then the other part of it
[41:00] is sort of the cipher punk ethos of
[41:03] Bitcoin becomes pervasive and ubiquitous
[41:05] around the world around the values of of
[41:08] liberty and and uh sovereignty and um
[41:13] community. Uh those values are embedded
[41:16] in society and it's it's a very much of
[41:18] an optimistic take on where the future
[41:20] could go if Bitcoin was the base layer
[41:22] of our economy. And then I have chapters
[41:25] on everything from how we can make food
[41:27] better, how we can make housing more
[41:29] affordable, how um we will address
[41:32] consumerism through uh you know a low
[41:35] time preference. So it's kind of looking
[41:37] at the journey I hope and I believe we
[41:39] could be on as humanity as Bitcoin
[41:42] becomes increasingly the base layer of
[41:44] our economy. That's interesting. How do
[41:47] you uh is it always interesting when I
[41:49] look at the future especially I mean
[41:51] there's this whole Jeff thing where uh
[41:53] everything will get more efficient and
[41:55] then it's it's like you you can get more
[41:58] and more with the same amount of of of
[42:00] Bitcoin basically but it really
[42:02] accelerates when you get get AI in the
[42:05] conversation. So how do you look at the
[42:08] future with with EI and and then
[42:10] Bitcoin? That's a great question and I
[42:12] think it's an underexplored topic in the
[42:14] Bitcoin community if you ask me. These
[42:17] are two extremely
[42:20] important exponential technologies that
[42:24] have been born
[42:27] independently to initially solve
[42:30] different
[42:31] problems but they are converging on the
[42:34] world and in my opinion Bitcoin is the
[42:37] base layer of the economy and AI is
[42:39] basically the base layer of all economic
[42:42] activity and our engagement with each
[42:44] other and with commerce And when they
[42:47] combine forces, you know, some people
[42:49] would argue AI is a bit of a
[42:50] centralizing force or it can be and
[42:53] Bitcoin can help counteract that with a
[42:55] more decentralizing based layer of the
[42:58] economy. But I think the combination I
[43:00] have a chapter chapter 10 in the book is
[43:02] just on it's called uh Bitcoin AI and
[43:04] the future work. So it's like, okay,
[43:07] part of the reason I called the book
[43:08] Bitcoin Singularity is singularity as a
[43:11] topic that's been embraced in the
[43:12] technology community emerged from the AI
[43:15] world as a point in the future in which
[43:18] AI basically
[43:21] um becomes general intelligence and
[43:24] supersedes humans own intelligence. And
[43:27] I was thinking about okay well what is
[43:30] Bitcoin singularity is the point at
[43:31] which Bitcoin exceeds all other
[43:35] economies all other fiat all other
[43:37] things we know and becomes you know the
[43:39] most powerful base layer of our economy
[43:41] but also converges with AI and the
[43:44] singularity of AI and what does that
[43:46] look like I think I mean there's a lot
[43:49] of dystopian and utopian views of what
[43:51] will happen with AI with or without
[43:55] Bitcoin I I think It's first of all it's
[43:58] impossible to imagine a world where AI
[44:00] will agentic AI so agents that have the
[44:04] need to transact first of all they don't
[44:07] won't be able to go through KYC know
[44:09] your customer stuff they'll have to
[44:10] engage in digital uh transactions AI
[44:15] is omnisient to a level is approaching
[44:19] omnition and knowledge that humans can't
[44:22] have themselves but it can certainly
[44:24] have all the knowledge humans have and
[44:27] it can have it all in seconds. So you
[44:30] spin up an AI agent, it is not a lot of
[44:32] work for an AI agent to quickly discover
[44:34] what's the best money. Not like AI could
[44:37] consume every best book in Bitcoin ever
[44:41] made and in kinesian economics and look
[44:44] at the trends of fiat and money printing
[44:48] and it won't take long for AI to say,
[44:50] "No, I only accept payment in Bitcoin."
[44:52] I'm pretty sure that's what's going to
[44:54] happen. And and so from that
[44:57] perspective, if you accept that the AI
[45:00] is going to become the base layer
[45:02] technology that's going to transform
[45:04] kind of everything we do in the world
[45:06] and and Bitcoin being the base money of
[45:08] everything we do in the world, then you
[45:10] say they have to come together. AI
[45:12] agents are going to end up using
[45:14] Bitcoin. And I think a AI agents will
[45:17] get to um crossing the chasm and
[45:20] critical mass adoption of Bitcoin faster
[45:22] than humans will because they're smarter
[45:24] than humans are as a general rule. And
[45:26] they will collectively demand that
[45:28] anyone interacting with them, any one or
[45:30] any robot or any agent interacting with
[45:32] them transact in Bitcoin. So uh at a at
[45:36] a core to me that uh Bitcoin is going to
[45:39] be the base layer of the economy. AI is
[45:40] going to be the base layer of everything
[45:42] we do and how we interact with the
[45:43] world. and AI is gonna transact on
[45:46] Bitcoin before we do at the same scale.
[45:51] That's
[45:53] interesting. I I have a question there
[45:56] where I have two theories that are
[45:58] countive to each
[46:00] other. I I I wonder if AI is
[46:03] accelerating bitcoin bitcoin adoption or
[46:05] not because the the on the one hand a
[46:10] definitely chooses bitcoin. EI is aware
[46:13] of the problems and AI agents will
[46:15] choose Bitcoin. And EI maybe makes
[46:18] people more aware about the problem of
[46:20] the fiat currency. If I I talk I talk to
[46:24] CHBD probably every freaking day. Uh
[46:27] probably too much. I give them probably
[46:29] way too many information. It's probably
[46:31] not a good idea to do that. But I get
[46:36] smarter with that. like I get I have so
[46:38] much more information and I just like
[46:40] how can I do that like oh okay that's
[46:42] how you do it you get so much
[46:44] information
[46:45] um but at the same time AI makes people
[46:51] more productive and more efficient so it
[46:55] might just cover up more of the
[46:57] inflation so it might just prolong
[46:59] weirdly enough the the the life of fiat
[47:02] those are the two things that I always
[47:04] look at and uh I don't know if the even
[47:07] each other out or if AI will actually
[47:09] accelerate the the bit I mean in the end
[47:11] of the day it's doesn't matter because
[47:13] Bitcoin will have uh the will will
[47:16] prolong as will will pursue as the the
[47:19] main money either way but I'm just
[47:21] wondering if if AI might help to
[47:24] accelerate the Bitcoin adoption or maybe
[47:27] even fear with with the making people
[47:29] more efficient. So I my sense is AI is
[47:34] an extremely powerful deflationary
[47:36] force. There's no doubt about it. But
[47:39] and it's accelerating at a rate that's
[47:41] unprecedented in a lot of ways.
[47:45] Um I don't think it can mask the
[47:48] problems with fiat enough to solve the
[47:51] problems to extend the life
[47:53] significantly of fiat.
[47:55] Um, and for the other reason I already
[47:58] said the AI agents are going to be using
[48:00] Bitcoin. So they're going to be
[48:01] accelerating the adoption as well. And
[48:03] as you say, they're also going to
[48:04] accelerate knowledge gathering from more
[48:07] people from more institutions who will
[48:09] increasingly understand quicker than
[48:11] than we did the power of Bitcoin and why
[48:14] we need to move there. You know, one
[48:16] thing that it's kind of directly on this
[48:18] subject, I've been thinking about a lot
[48:20] lately because I keep seeing references
[48:22] in goo in um Bitcoin Twitter about how
[48:26] shockingly low the searches in Google
[48:29] are on Bitcoin. And one thing I think
[48:31] they're missing in that data is how many
[48:34] people are now searching for that in AI
[48:36] and not in Google. So, are we sure that
[48:39] people aren't looking for it or are they
[48:40] looking in AI now? Because I don't look
[48:42] at Google for hardly anything anymore.
[48:45] So going to your point about the fact
[48:48] that AI can also be powerful and
[48:50] powerful in terms of its ability to
[48:52] accelerate your learning and knowledge.
[48:53] I I have a feeling a lot of people are
[48:55] already learning about Bitcoin through
[48:56] AI and we don't have a good way of
[48:58] measuring that. So who knows for sure.
[49:01] But when you go to like the the debt of
[49:05] Japan, they're at what 160% of GDP. The
[49:09] US, no, they're at 260% of GDP. You
[49:13] might have seen recently the Japanese
[49:16] economic minister said that their
[49:17] economic condition is worse than
[49:19] Greece's was when they went through
[49:20] their crisis and the data proves he's
[49:23] right because the Greece's uh jet debt
[49:26] to GDP was something like 130% when they
[49:29] had their crisis and the European Union
[49:31] had to save them whereas Japan somewhere
[49:34] 250
[49:35] 260%. And the US is above Greece's level
[49:38] from that time and it's only getting
[49:41] worse not better. you know the whole
[49:42] Doge everyone was so excited about Doge
[49:44] was going to knock out a trillion or
[49:46] trillion dollars of government spending
[49:49] every year and they knocked out like 150
[49:51] billion which is literally peanuts in
[49:53] the scope of things. So um it's you know
[49:57] as Lyn Alden says nothing stops this
[49:59] train and I think that includes AI. AI's
[50:02] productivity driven um deflation is not
[50:05] going to be enough to stop the train.
[50:06] They're going to have to keep printing
[50:08] as Larry Leard says and in the end um
[50:12] fiat is going to see its demise and I
[50:14] think sooner rather than a lot of people
[50:16] expect.
[50:18] There's something super interesting on
[50:20] on on Google trends that I I want to
[50:23] show you because you are right with with
[50:26] the
[50:28] um with the Google searches. I hardly
[50:30] search anything on Google these days.
[50:33] Uh but there's something uh other than
[50:36] that also there there's a web search
[50:38] which when we look back the the biggest
[50:41] uh uptick was uh 200 oh wait that's past
[50:45] 5 years was 2017 I think was the biggest
[50:49] let's go let's go even further back yeah
[50:52] 2017 it was um the the big upswing uh so
[50:57] in here we are down at 7% of that but if
[51:00] you now switch do YouTube
[51:03] search. It's still down, but it's a lot
[51:07] more up. So, I I think YouTube because
[51:10] YouTube grows and like people still uh
[51:12] type things into into YouTube and and
[51:14] and use YouTube a lot more. So, AI is
[51:17] not not interfering with YouTube. Maybe
[51:20] still people like uh first go to to AI,
[51:23] but I think YouTube is a little less um
[51:26] affected by by that than than Google. Uh
[51:29] and then we actually see um a little bit
[51:32] more of an interesting uh comparison
[51:35] where we're like 25% of 2017. And this
[51:38] is it. This feels more accurate also to
[51:41] me when I look in my small subjective
[51:44] world outside of Bitcoin here in my real
[51:46] life in in Austria because 2017 was the
[51:51] first time I heard about Bitcoin and it
[51:52] was everywhere and you couldn't go
[51:55] anywhere without hearing about Bitcoin.
[51:58] Now, Bitcoin reaches 100k and nobody
[52:00] cares like people are asleep for some
[52:04] reason. Uh but uh more and more people
[52:07] are aware of it and so like it's uh this
[52:11] seems to be a little bit more accurate
[52:13] than the 7% and yeah 24% that's like uh
[52:18] three times four times as much as on
[52:21] Google searches. Yeah. No, that that is
[52:23] that does make sense and I agree with
[52:25] you. It's not it's not penetrating the
[52:27] mainstream like you would think. Not
[52:29] just for price action. Like what
[52:31] surprises me is like you know the whole
[52:34] strategy stuff and the SB uh this
[52:37] strategic Bitcoin reserves and you know
[52:40] there's so much news. It's not just NGU
[52:42] number go up stuff. this the the the
[52:46] pace of news around Bitcoin is insane
[52:48] right now for those that are paying
[52:50] attention, but apparently a lot of
[52:52] people are not not in our circles and
[52:55] not seeing a lot of that news. It's not
[52:57] resonating with them when it comes out.
[53:00] Uh you know, even you know, I'm I'm at a
[53:02] I'm a currently I'm a professor in a
[53:04] business school and uh my colleagues
[53:07] don't know anything about Bitcoin, like
[53:09] nothing. And they're professors in a
[53:11] business school. they they literally
[53:13] don't know anything. One of my
[53:14] colleagues, I was talking about Bitcoin.
[53:16] This was a few months ago and uh he
[53:19] didn't know anything about it. He'd
[53:21] heard about it, but he didn't know
[53:22] anything about it. And I started trying
[53:23] to, you know, go back to first
[53:25] principles and explain and I start with
[53:28] something around, you know, well, here's
[53:30] why Bitcoin is better than fiat. And his
[53:33] very first question, what is fiat?
[53:36] business school professor. He's been a
[53:38] professor for 30 years. Has published
[53:40] probably 50, 80 peer-reviewed academic
[53:44] articles, not on
[53:46] economics. People don't always
[53:48] appreciate the difference between a
[53:50] business professor and an economics
[53:52] professor. You know, business school
[53:54] professors don't tend to be super deep
[53:56] in economics and kinesisian verse
[53:57] Austria and all the rest, but finance
[54:00] and business of course is their is their
[54:02] thing. Management.
[54:05] So, you know, if business school faculty
[54:07] don't know anything about Bitcoin, then
[54:09] how can we presume the average person on
[54:11] the street does, and you know, I I I
[54:14] guarantee you, you go on any street
[54:15] except if you're in a Bitcoin circular
[54:17] economy or happen to be like in Las
[54:19] Vegas during a conference about Bitcoin,
[54:22] you're going to find very few people
[54:23] have any clue about Bitcoin. The other
[54:25] day I was in a I was somewhere. Oh,
[54:27] yeah. when I was in Orlando and I was
[54:29] about to leave from the Bitcoin for
[54:30] corporations conference and uh I went to
[54:34] buy some gifts for my family to bring
[54:36] home and a woman I went to have lunch
[54:38] and the woman asked me oh what are you
[54:39] in town for for holiday I'm like no I'm
[54:42] here for a conference going home to
[54:44] later today she's like well what what
[54:45] was it about I said bitcoin and she oh I
[54:48] don't know anything about that and she
[54:49] walked away she didn't even know what to
[54:51] say yeah it's I had the similar
[54:53] experience in Amsterdam I said to the
[54:55] guy that I'm here for I I bought a
[54:58] falafel like the the the Durham thing in
[55:01] in Amsterdam and uh I told him I'm here
[55:04] for a conference and he's like oh the
[55:06] thing that just got bought by uh Black
[55:09] Rockck like he he he thought Black
[55:11] Rockck now owns all all the Bitcoin
[55:15] network that was really surprising he
[55:19] knew the word Black Rockck and even knew
[55:21] that like that's that's at least he was
[55:23] getting close to something real. Yeah,
[55:26] it's it's when you thought about when
[55:27] you said that with fear, I had that meme
[55:29] in mind. You you probably have have seen
[55:32] that this like uh fear of the fiat car
[55:36] of like why do the cryptocurrency people
[55:38] hate us so much? Leave us alone. I
[55:41] haven't seen that, but that's funny. You
[55:44] haven't seen that? That's a that's a
[55:46] such a classic. It's it's a it's a
[55:48] really good one. I It's It's such a
[55:50] classic that I never actually saw the
[55:52] real tweet. I don't even know if they
[55:55] actually tweeted that, but I assume they
[55:57] actually did tweet that. But, uh, it's
[56:00] it's like it's it's like probably every
[56:02] year a few times in in my feed, so I see
[56:05] see it every now and then. That's a good
[56:07] one. I like it. I might have to use that
[56:08] sometime.
[56:10] Yeah. So, like Yeah, this but it's I I
[56:13] agree. It's it's the it's the best cycle
[56:16] for news and the worst cycle for price
[56:19] action. It's It feels like everything is
[56:20] bullish, like we're going to the moon.
[56:23] There's no real bad things coming out
[56:25] you know like when Elon Musk in 2021
[56:27] said Bitcoin is bad for environment like
[56:29] that's a there's no such bad things
[56:32] happening in this cycle all all the bad
[56:35] things that are happening are so small
[56:37] and nobody cares about them but
[56:41] apparently maybe we need more hate that
[56:44] we can get more love maybe I mean yeah I
[56:47] mean that it's an interesting question
[56:49] like what would it take for Bitcoin to
[56:51] reach public consciousness at scale
[56:54] without it necessarily being you know
[56:56] FTX crap or something like that. And I
[57:00] think it would probably be a
[57:03] country like US buying Bitcoin for their
[57:08] SPR would make ripple effects in Bitcoin
[57:11] big time but would not reach mainstream
[57:15] even though it's massive. It wouldn't.
[57:18] But what would would be a country people
[57:20] are familiar with accepting it as legal
[57:24] tender something like that like a
[57:27] country a lot of pe like I'm thinking of
[57:29] I used to live in Spain so I'm thinking
[57:30] of Spain like Spain which like so many
[57:33] people go to visit and like if they just
[57:36] announce they're not they're very far
[57:38] behind they're they're they're very
[57:41] bureaucratic and very far behind but
[57:43] like imagine they announce they're only
[57:45] going to start they're they're leaving
[57:46] the European union, monetary union, and
[57:50] they're going to only take Bitcoin now.
[57:52] I mean, that would be that would be
[57:54] ripple effects because it would affect
[57:56] everything in the economy. It would
[57:58] affect uh you know, geopolitical and
[58:01] hundred what is it 100 million I don't
[58:03] know how many people visit Spain every
[58:05] year as a tourist and they'd have to
[58:06] figure out how to get Bitcoin to be
[58:08] there and everything. There would have
[58:10] to be something like that for it to be
[58:11] like a single thing to bring it to
[58:13] collective consciousness. But I think
[58:16] what we're gonna see it's just going to
[58:18] be more of a you know the gradual then
[58:20] suddenly thing but it'll be more
[58:23] like when economies start falling fiat
[58:26] start you know the Japan Japan could be
[58:30] the first fiat like top 10 to go under
[58:34] and what do they do in in response the
[58:37] the ripple effect will be massive. They
[58:40] may not embrace Bitcoin but it will end
[58:43] up resulting in Bitcoin being top of
[58:45] mind around the world as a fix to the
[58:47] problems of fiat that as of today it's
[58:50] like when Argentina or Venezuela or
[58:53] Zimbabwe go through
[58:55] hyperinflation the part of the world
[58:57] that is you know lives in dominant
[58:59] economies where their currency is
[59:02] relatively stable it barely registers
[59:05] for those people they don't really
[59:06] understand the pain but when it happens
[59:08] to an economy that they're familiar with
[59:11] that's supposed to be
[59:12] indestructible. Uh, I think it it might
[59:15] require something like that. What if
[59:17] Austria adopts an Austrian economics
[59:20] Bitcoin standard
[59:22] like they they definitely should, but
[59:25] Austria might be too small. No, I was
[59:28] going to say it wouldn't it wouldn't do
[59:29] it. It wouldn't do it because probably I
[59:32] don't know if you ask this might offend
[59:35] you, but I'm not trying to offend you.
[59:36] If you ask 10 people on the street in
[59:40] Mexico where I am right now or in Singap
[59:43] well Singapore they're more formally
[59:46] educated or in I don't know name name a
[59:48] country far from from Europe you know um
[59:51] El Salvador or I don't know name name
[59:53] another one maybe further in Northeast
[59:55] Asia or someplace and say you know uh
[59:58] where is find Austria on a map.
[60:02] Some of them are going to actually point
[60:03] to Australia if they know where
[60:04] Australia is on the map because they
[60:06] don't differentiate Austria and
[60:07] Australia. I've had that experience with
[60:09] people. Um, and then others will say
[60:11] it's somewhere in Europe and they would
[60:12] have no idea how to identify it on a
[60:14] map. So, no, I don't think Austria would
[60:16] be enough even though it would be
[60:18] awesome if Austria did do it. That that
[60:20] would be it would make a lot of sense.
[60:22] was uh I I'm uh I'm a lot I'm trying to
[60:25] travel as much as possible and uh I had
[60:29] this meme in real life happening to me
[60:32] since like like I don't know like for
[60:34] five 10 times or something like that
[60:36] where I uh where I have a conversation
[60:38] with someone and uh they say oh like
[60:42] where are you from and and I'm like yeah
[60:44] Austria and they're like oh I love
[60:48] kangaroos Austria not Australia So like
[60:52] um I get that because um outside of
[60:57] Europe I mean in Europe I guess most
[60:59] people are aware of Austria. Uh but
[61:01] outside of Europe like most people are
[61:03] like oh like Austria like what is this
[61:05] like where where is this? Maybe uh like
[61:08] like they know Arnold
[61:10] Schwarzenegger they know Adolf Hitler.
[61:14] They might know like Mozart and some
[61:16] little bit of culture things from
[61:18] Austria. I don't think people all know
[61:20] that those are from Austria originally
[61:22] though. Yeah. Yeah. That that's that's
[61:24] the thing. Uh it's like Yeah. It's like
[61:27] is they from Germany? Like maybe like
[61:30] And I even get it sometimes where people
[61:32] are like, "Hey, you're you're the
[61:33] YouTuber from Germany, right?" Like,
[61:35] "No, I'm
[61:37] not. It's different."
[61:40] It definitely is too small of a country.
[61:42] We We have the mountains, we have the
[61:44] lakes, but we don't have kangaroos.
[61:47] Austria is beautiful, though. I the
[61:48] first time I ever tried snowboarding was
[61:50] in Gitizo in like uh
[61:55] 1995, I think. Man, that that was before
[61:58] I even came on Earth.
[62:02] Yeah, but you got Bitcoin before I did.
[62:04] So, you know, you got to give yourself
[62:05] credit for that. I'm I'm in Bitcoin
[62:09] since I'm 21 years old. So, I'm I'm I'm
[62:11] pretty pretty proud of of that fact for
[62:15] sure.
[62:16] 21 with Bitcoin. Um I have one question
[62:19] that I ask each and every one of my
[62:20] guests and the question is what can we
[62:22] learn from you besides Bitcoin? So as I
[62:25] mentioned before I I've most of my work
[62:28] has been around the intersection of sort
[62:29] of technology and sustainability and I
[62:32] think you know in the Bitcoin community
[62:34] I think there's sort of a lovehate
[62:36] relationship with sustainability. You
[62:39] know the hate that Bitcoin has gotten
[62:41] around energy consumption of mining and
[62:43] everything. I think I could help
[62:46] Bitcoiners appreciate the values from
[62:49] the sustainability community and reach a
[62:51] much larger audience. Um, but you know
[62:54] going beyond the topic of Bitcoin just
[62:57] better understanding the sustainability
[62:59] challenges the world is facing and how
[63:02] we can innovate in a profitable way to
[63:04] solve those problems. So like in
[63:06] Bitcoin, one of the things that is very
[63:08] anti-sustainability is the whole DEI and
[63:10] it feels like interventionists and all
[63:12] the rest of it. And my focus has always
[63:15] been on on the profitable approaches to
[63:17] cha to tackling sustainability
[63:19] challenges. So that would probably be my
[63:21] answer. Interesting. I love that. Then
[63:24] then then I guess you also are forced
[63:27] into into those mining conversations and
[63:30] energy mining conversations a lot. Sure.
[63:33] You know, I I had a um I one of the
[63:36] reasons I didn't adopt Bitcoin right
[63:38] away as far as something I was really
[63:39] intrigued by was I believed in all the
[63:41] FUD around the the energy consumption
[63:43] and the CO2 emissions. And it was like
[63:45] felt inconsistent of my interest in
[63:48] merging tech and sustainability together
[63:50] that I would embrace a tech that's bad
[63:52] for the environment. And that was
[63:53] actually one of the the barriers for me.
[63:55] And and one of the reasons I came around
[63:57] to Bitcoin was I studied it more and
[63:59] realized that Bitcoin mining was
[64:00] actually contributing to accelerating
[64:02] renewable energy adoption and helping
[64:04] bring more inclusive energy to more
[64:06] people. And I have a whole chapter in my
[64:07] book on that to to address that topic. I
[64:10] love it. Really really cool. Uh yeah,
[64:11] it's it's actually a less and less I I
[64:16] maybe it's been a year since the last
[64:18] time I heard the energy fat from someone
[64:21] actually. like it it's it's gone way
[64:23] almost uh since Black Rock came in the
[64:26] scene weirdly enough declining. Yeah,
[64:28] it's declining and you know I don't know
[64:29] if you've have you interviewed Daniel
[64:30] Battton. I have him actually this week.
[64:33] So I will talk with him I think tomorrow
[64:35] or day after tomorrow. So he's you know
[64:37] one of the global resident experts in
[64:39] Bitcoin around the sustainability of
[64:42] Bitcoin mining and he influenced a lot
[64:44] of my thinking on it and I cite him
[64:46] probably four or five times in the
[64:47] chapter I have on Bitcoin mining and
[64:49] energy. Um, and he's been articulating,
[64:52] he's been sharing the peer-reviewed
[64:54] academic research about Bitcoin and
[64:56] energy and has demonstrated that over
[64:59] the last few years, the FUD is
[65:00] disappearing even from the academic
[65:02] community as they start to to get under
[65:04] the hood and realize from real data that
[65:07] no, it's actually is helping accelerate
[65:09] renewable energy options. So, yeah,
[65:11] you're right.
[65:12] Really cool. Um, we have an end in the
[65:15] podcast where the previous guest is
[65:16] asking a question for the next guest
[65:18] without knowing who the next guest
[65:19] actually is. And the question from the
[65:21] previous guest is an interesting one.
[65:23] What is the biggest value you personally
[65:26] got from Bitcoin? I think well I've
[65:29] always had a patience side of me.
[65:32] The low time preference.
[65:36] Um, I I know like recently you've said
[65:39] this in in some of your recent pods
[65:41] quite a bit about how people that get
[65:43] all worked up
[65:44] about daily fluctuations in Bitcoin
[65:47] price should touch grass more and all
[65:48] the rest. And I think I've gotten more
[65:51] that way because of Bitcoin. Even though
[65:53] I've always had a patient side to me, I
[65:56] also can be impatient about things. And
[65:58] you know, I'm at a different stage in my
[65:59] career than you are. You know, I'm 54. I
[66:01] didn't want to work forever. you know, I
[66:04] didn't get fire when I I didn't even
[66:05] know fire didn't exist as a thing when I
[66:08] was your age. So, uh, it never occurred
[66:10] to me that there was a way to not work
[66:13] until you're 65 or 70. I just thought
[66:15] that's what you did. And so, my point
[66:18] being, you know, I could be impatient
[66:20] about retirement and everything and and
[66:22] and getting into Bitcoin has helped me
[66:24] appreciate having patience even at my
[66:26] age. I'm not that old. You know, I still
[66:28] hopefully have many decades ahead of me.
[66:31] And uh you know I'm I'm I'm more patient
[66:34] about a lot of things and I try to share
[66:38] that low tide preference with people uh
[66:41] who are feeling impatient. You might
[66:43] live
[66:44] forever. May maybe life has no end.
[66:48] There's the you have you heard the
[66:49] longevity escape velocity that uh some
[66:52] of the deep experts in longevity
[66:54] research combining with AI think that
[66:56] it's a possibility and by 2030 if you're
[66:59] still alive you could technically live
[67:02] forever not exactly forever but
[67:04] basically you gain one year of life for
[67:06] every year you've lived because of the
[67:08] benefits of technology AI biogenetics
[67:12] all converging so yeah you could be
[67:14] right super interesting it's super
[67:16] interesting I just want uh uh share that
[67:19] with you. I I don't know. Have you heard
[67:21] about Brian Johnson? Yes. Yes. He is at
[67:25] the Bitcoin conference in Las Vegas. I
[67:27] I've seen it. Wait, I'll I'll probably
[67:29] find it directly. Yeah. He uh this guy
[67:32] Brian Johnson. I I literally um saw his
[67:35] documentary on Netflix and a few days
[67:38] later I scrolled through the speaker
[67:40] list because I wanted to see someone and
[67:42] I see him. I'm like, really? He's a
[67:44] Bitcoiner? like what what does he do in
[67:47] the so it's it's really interesting the
[67:49] uh combination of longevity and bitcoin
[67:53] it combines like uh having more wealth
[67:56] but also having more time and bitcoin is
[67:58] all aware that time is the only thing
[68:01] more valuable than the actual bitcoin
[68:05] and what if as you say what if maybe
[68:07] that's not true anymore if longevity is
[68:10] if we if we do reach this gay velocity
[68:13] maybe maybe uh bitcoin is the most
[68:15] scarce asset on earth. We'll see. I you
[68:18] know what I think I know we're wrapping
[68:20] up, but my my take on this because I'm
[68:23] very into all the exponential
[68:24] technologies. I've studied them quite a
[68:26] bit. I teach about them and how they
[68:28] converge increasingly and that's what's
[68:30] really fascinating. You know, Bitcoin
[68:31] and AI convergence for example. I think
[68:34] we are getting very close to some I
[68:37] don't I wouldn't call it longevity
[68:39] escape velocity the way it's defined
[68:40] that we're you know by 2030 we might
[68:43] actually live uh
[68:45] indefinitely but when you look at all
[68:48] the technologies
[68:49] converging what I feel like a we're
[68:52] going to be able to extend the quality
[68:54] of life for everyone on earth over time
[68:58] which means the quality of the end of
[69:00] your life so if you're going to live to
[69:02] be 85 5 and you still only live to be
[69:06] 85, but you would have started in the
[69:08] 70s with cancer or some other
[69:10] debilitating disease and have to survive
[69:12] 15 years on that before you die. You
[69:14] might live a healthy full life more
[69:16] towards the end and more productive
[69:18] including your ability to contribute or
[69:21] or create or whatever and AI will help
[69:23] us do that. Um similarly with things
[69:26] like organs you know we're starting to
[69:28] learn how to cultivate organs with uh
[69:30] actually at my university they're they
[69:32] have patents around using uh pigs for
[69:35] certain types of organ cultivation. I
[69:38] mean some crazy stuff happening. So we
[69:40] can fix organs, we can fix skin, we can
[69:42] fix all kinds of things. Um and
[69:45] increasingly with exponential technology
[69:47] we'll be able to do that more and more.
[69:49] So I think what we're going to see first
[69:52] is extending the quality of life for
[69:54] people and we're going to gradually see
[69:56] a growing um projected uh lifespan of
[69:59] people as well and probably
[70:02] um in your lifetime you will see um
[70:05] average people living in their hundreds.
[70:07] I I that would not surprise like 105
[70:09] 108.
[70:12] Ah absolutely it it's just there's so
[70:15] much interesting things going on. Uh,
[70:18] it's like AI, longevity, Bitcoin, uh,
[70:21] and, uh, it's it's unbelievable. What a
[70:24] what a time to be alive. Thank you so
[70:25] much.
[70:27] What a time to be alive. Thank you so
[70:28] much, boy, for for for being such a
[70:31] great uh, speaker and guest on on on my
[70:33] podcast today. And before I let you go,
[70:35] where can people find you, ask you
[70:37] questions, and reach out to you? Yeah.
[70:39] Uh, so I'm easy accessible on X at Boyd
[70:42] Boyd Cohen. So, first name, last name.
[70:45] Uh I also have a website bitcoins
[70:47] singularity.ai which talks a bit more
[70:49] about me and my book as well. Really
[70:52] cool. Thank you so much uh boy for for
[70:54] being on and also thank you so much for
[70:55] everyone that is watching and listening
[70:57] for joining us today. As always I'll be
[70:59] back tomorrow with another episode.
[71:01] Bye-bye.
