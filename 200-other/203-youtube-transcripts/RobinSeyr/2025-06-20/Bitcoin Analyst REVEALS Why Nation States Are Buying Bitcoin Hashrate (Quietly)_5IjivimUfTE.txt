[00:00] You've got nation states potentially
[00:02] buying hash rates at an all-time highs.
[00:04] I know that the UAE are mining Bitcoin
[00:06] with their renewable energy and like you
[00:09] couldn't get more bullish news globally.
[00:11] We've got the experience, the
[00:13] capabilities of understanding the market
[00:15] really well. They were the first ever
[00:17] blockchain company to IPO. We will see
[00:19] one to three to 5% of that money that
[00:22] should have gone into gold go into
[00:24] Bitcoin. So if we can see these
[00:26] companies be successful as Bitcoin
[00:28] Treasury companies, then I think a lot
[00:30] more people will go public. I've said
[00:32] that the UK is an election cycle behind
[00:35] the US. So we have four years. So we're
[00:37] essentially where what 2020ish kind of
[00:40] where the US were. So all these idiotic
[00:43] policies that they're doing are going to
[00:45] make the issues and situations worse in
[00:47] the UK. More money leaving the country.
[00:50] So again, why they don't like Bitcoin is
[00:52] Bitcoin I can get up and just leave. The
[00:55] FCA don't really understand Bitcoin
[00:57] crypto. They don't understand the
[00:58] ecosystem and it should get to a point
[01:01] where they're like we need to hire
[01:03] expert. I guess the bullish news is you
[01:04] you're comfortably over 100,000 which
[01:06] would have been a dream whenever 5 10
[01:08] years ago.
[01:11] Before
[01:13] we get started in the in all the topics,
[01:15] maybe give us some small intro of like
[01:17] who you are and and why you're excited
[01:19] about Bitcoin. Uh yeah, so my name is
[01:21] James Van Stratton. I'm the senior
[01:23] analyst at CoinDesk. Um and I also
[01:26] advise a public company in the United
[01:28] Kingdom on their Bitcoin treasury
[01:30] strategy called Coinsium.
[01:33] Um so I've been in the Bitcoin space
[01:35] since 2017. I got in I will remember
[01:39] remember it very vividly in uh in
[01:42] December I bought the top at $20,000
[01:46] um and then uh did my learnings through
[01:49] the bare market of 2018 became quite
[01:53] involved in the in the space
[01:56] and then COVID came and it changed my
[01:58] world view on pretty much everything.
[02:01] Uh, so at $3,000, I'm sitting there.
[02:04] Financial markets have imploded. I'm
[02:07] pretty much all in at this point. Um,
[02:10] other than my deposit for my house, uh,
[02:12] that I wanted to buy in London, and that
[02:15] completely went into Bitcoin. Um, so
[02:18] that was probably one of the best trades
[02:19] I'll ever do. Um but for me COVID was a
[02:23] symbolism of of a two-tiered market
[02:26] system of one how you can um
[02:30] how you can shut down the entire global
[02:32] economy and financial markets are
[02:35] soaring to all-time highs. To me that
[02:37] made no sense.
[02:39] It was the huge distortion of the elites
[02:42] versus everyone else. Uh and then the
[02:45] trust with the institutions went to
[02:47] all-time lows. So I think all of that uh
[02:51] kind of increased my bullishness on
[02:54] Bitcoin as an asset that no one can
[02:57] control uh and every other every other
[03:00] characteristic of it as well. And then
[03:02] the the holy grail for my understanding
[03:05] of Bitcoin from 2017 2018 was the ETFs
[03:09] and um when the ETFs got launched I was
[03:12] extremely bullish on them as well and
[03:15] yeah we h I haven't been proved wrong.
[03:16] They were the most successful ETF launch
[03:18] of all time. And um the US have really
[03:21] powered on and become a huge global uh
[03:24] Bitcoin crypto hub now. Um which is
[03:26] great to see, but the UK where I live um
[03:29] is just languishing so far behind. Um
[03:33] and I'm sure we'll go into the details
[03:34] of it. Absolutely. It's interesting how
[03:37] UK and Europe in general is is kind of
[03:39] lagging behind. But it's interesting.
[03:41] COVID was for a lot of people also for
[03:43] me a huge wakeup point. Turns out if you
[03:45] lock people inside, they actually ask
[03:48] the question why and and really ask more
[03:52] questions than uh than others might
[03:54] might want to to have. Um maybe let's
[03:56] get into Bitcoin Treasury companies. How
[03:58] do you see the development of
[04:00] institutional adoption um in in Bitcoin,
[04:04] but also like the the the contrast
[04:06] between US and and UK and and Europe in
[04:09] general? So I can I can start on the the
[04:12] story of the Bitcoin Treasury Company.
[04:13] So in August 2020 obviously Micro
[04:16] Strategy started their journey uh $1
[04:20] billion market cap. Um I heard of
[04:23] Michael Sailor in the 2000 tech boom
[04:24] that he took us he took his company down
[04:26] 90 95%.
[04:28] Um so when he got into Bitcoin I was
[04:30] like bit nervous but
[04:33] um in the UK
[04:36] we you retail are banned from any form
[04:40] of crypto or bitcoin ETF ETN or any
[04:44] exchange traded product on the market.
[04:46] There was a time where the FCA did the
[04:49] financial conduct authority. We did have
[04:53] access to ETF ETFs, ETNs, but they
[04:56] banned them around January of 2021.
[04:59] They were saying there's high risk,
[05:00] market volatility, abuse in the market,
[05:03] inadequate understanding of from retail
[05:06] on Bitcoin and crypto. Um, so there was
[05:10] no exposure to Bitcoin unless you could
[05:13] buy spot on Coinbase or any exchange.
[05:16] But obviously we know how difficult it
[05:19] is relatively for the layman to buy it
[05:21] and hold it and custody it correctly. So
[05:26] everyone then has access or like my
[05:29] pension for example is sitting in the
[05:30] NASDAQ 100 or Tesla or whatever it is.
[05:34] And then Mike strategy comes along and
[05:37] you're like, why not? Don't know. Could
[05:40] just fail, but this guy likes Bitcoin,
[05:43] so do I. Put it all in. So that was
[05:46] pretty much the trend that anyone that
[05:49] was in the UK did it. And now I know of
[05:53] hundreds of billions of pounds sitting
[05:56] in these ISIS and SIPs that are sitting
[05:58] in Micro Strategy. So obviously it's
[06:01] done like a 3,000% return and it's been
[06:04] incredible. And then like every week I
[06:08] get a message from Harris Landsdown who
[06:10] are the UK's biggest broker. I think
[06:12] there's one trillion pounds of assets
[06:14] sitting in SIPs. So sips are um a
[06:17] pension that you can control yourself
[06:20] and then IS are I don't know what they
[06:22] stand for but that's again your own
[06:24] investment um uh pot and um
[06:30] so there's a trillion sitting in there.
[06:32] They've all moved to Mic Strategy
[06:34] because that's the only real Bitcoin
[06:36] exposure you can get. And every week on
[06:38] Harrey's lands down you can see um mic
[06:40] strategy was the most purchased stock
[06:42] like continuously just in out
[06:45] outperforms Nvidia outperforms
[06:47] everything. So the UK retail market is
[06:49] starved for growth similar to Japan. Um
[06:54] and then a few a few years later um so
[06:59] in January of this year I joined
[07:01] Coinsium as an adviser who are also
[07:04] listed on Hargre's Lands down but
[07:06] they're on the Aquis market. So you've
[07:08] got the LSE the London Stock Exchange
[07:10] which is the main market. You then have
[07:12] AIM and then the Aquis market. Um, so
[07:15] there are now a couple of UK treasury
[07:17] companies that have done it and we're
[07:19] seeing huge volume like uh Aquis is
[07:22] known for no liquidity, no volume and uh
[07:26] Coinsium has pretty much broken trading
[07:28] volume records. So it's been amazing to
[07:31] see. So, we're now starting to see
[07:33] because Micro Strategy is at a point an
[07:35] inflection point where it's kind of
[07:37] stagnated and we can go into why it's
[07:40] stagnated, but we're now seeing rotation
[07:42] from Micro Strategy into the smaller cap
[07:46] stocks that are now having Bitcoin
[07:47] exposure because retail still can't get
[07:50] access to an ETF. So, even if Black
[07:52] Rockck wanted to list an ETF in the UK,
[07:55] they can't. Um there is a nuance if you
[07:59] are an accredited investor. So like you
[08:02] have a certain amount of assets under
[08:03] management, you earn a certain wage. I
[08:06] think you do a certain amount of trades
[08:07] a year, you do get deemed as an
[08:09] accredited investor. Therefore, you
[08:10] could buy an ETF. But for retail, which
[08:14] is 90 95% of the population in the UK
[08:17] can't. Um so now we're seeing all of
[08:20] this rotation coming into Coinsium. Um,
[08:24] and it just shows the level of
[08:27] incompetence. And I I say incompetence
[08:30] and corruption are very blurred lines
[08:32] with um with these regulated entities.
[08:36] Um, and if they just allowed uh for an
[08:39] ETF accredited by a Black Rockck or a
[08:42] Fidelity,
[08:43] um, you wouldn't have any of these
[08:46] so-cal huge multiple uh, premiums to
[08:49] MNAVs, anything like that. But um the
[08:53] FCA don't really understand Bitcoin
[08:56] crypto. They don't understand the
[08:57] ecosystem and it should get to a point
[09:00] where they're like we need to hire
[09:02] experts or but when you look at the
[09:05] FCA's
[09:06] um salary job descriptions, they're
[09:08] like450,000
[09:11] and the the cost of living crisis in the
[09:13] UK is is insane. 40,000 £50,000 can't
[09:16] get you very far. So, you're not going
[09:18] to hire very good people. And it's that
[09:20] perpetual doom loop that you're just
[09:22] hiring really bad people that are going
[09:23] to make really bad decisions that make
[09:26] the inefficiencies in the market. And
[09:28] it's just a it's just a circle and it's
[09:30] just a doom loop. So, we we found an
[09:32] arbitrage in the market um which works
[09:35] to our benefit, but you would like to
[09:38] see the UK really take on uh growth
[09:41] within the Bitcoin ecosystem.
[09:43] It's it's fascinating to see when
[09:46] because they they're trying to ban
[09:48] Bitcoin ETFs in the UK. The only thing
[09:51] they're doing they are not stopping it.
[09:52] They're just driving the innovation
[09:54] outside. So then the UK people are
[09:56] buying an American company strategy.
[09:58] It's it's a fascinating example. Yes. So
[10:00] the nuance as well to this is again as a
[10:04] UK investor I can't buy US ETFs. So I
[10:07] can't buy Black Rockck ETF, IBIT or
[10:10] Fidelities FBTC. So yeah, all the money
[10:14] has to go offshore to US companies. It
[10:18] it it's insane. So um again, Hargre's
[10:21] Landsown, you can see the top purchase
[10:22] stocks. They're all Nvidia, Tesla, any
[10:25] of the the Magnificent 7. It's just no
[10:27] no one's buying UK companies. So we're
[10:30] starved for growth in our UK equities
[10:32] market. I think the Footsie 100 since
[10:34] 2008 has appreciated 20%.
[10:38] But now we're speaking to the brokers
[10:40] who are brokering our fundraising. So in
[10:43] the past we we've in we did our first
[10:47] raise and we're a small market cap.
[10:49] We're about 15 million pounds. Uh we've
[10:52] raised5 million pound circa over two
[10:55] past two weeks. Um and the brokers have
[10:59] said this is the the most amount of like
[11:02] exuberance uh they've seen in the market
[11:05] since 2008.
[11:07] So the brokers are delighted. Um and it
[11:10] shows that there there is a huge demand
[11:12] for Bitcoin. Um and raising money is
[11:15] relatively easy as a Bitcoin treasury
[11:18] company. But again, you have the nuances
[11:20] with the flywheel effect where
[11:23] MetaPlanet
[11:24] essentially are are almost a 24-hour
[11:26] investment cycle. They can raise 0%
[11:29] ordinary bonds in debt and then they can
[11:32] go and buy Bitcoin. we have the ch the
[11:35] nuances within the UK market that we
[11:37] have to navigate as well. So it's not
[11:39] it's not as easy to raise money as
[11:42] opposed to the US market. Uh the US
[11:45] market has a plethora of options um such
[11:49] as convertible debt uh the ATM uh share
[11:53] sales that you can sell shares into the
[11:55] market. The UK has that. But you're also
[11:58] unknown on the demand side of if you
[12:00] listed a bond for example. So um
[12:04] yeah the U the UK market in terms of
[12:07] finances used to be the capital uh
[12:10] market for the world really
[12:13] understanding the UK market it has
[12:15] deteriorated and is so hard um to get
[12:19] that uh to get that flywheel effect but
[12:22] you can only do the best you can with
[12:24] the tools you have um and yeah it's
[12:27] amazing you see what the the NASDAQ
[12:29] listed companies do in the US and the
[12:31] volume and the market caps they can get
[12:33] to something you aspire to. You could
[12:36] potentially crosslist. Um, so yeah,
[12:39] we're very early in the journey, but
[12:41] I've I've said that the UK is an
[12:44] election cycle behind the US. So we have
[12:46] four years. So we're essentially where
[12:49] what 2020ish kind of where the US were.
[12:53] So that's our arbitrage and that's our
[12:55] momentum that we can pick up. So wait,
[12:58] there's now now just like one company
[13:01] that that is publicly traded in the UK
[13:03] that has Bitcoin. There's six, but the
[13:07] market cap I think combined with the six
[13:10] is
[13:12] 300 million. Like it's it's tiny. So not
[13:16] even half was what was strategy. Yeah.
[13:18] Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. And some of them are
[13:20] only doing putting on Bitcoin on their
[13:22] balance sheet because it gives you that
[13:24] volume and liquidity and that gets
[13:26] people to notice you. We've seen that
[13:28] with multiple American companies. Um
[13:32] so look, it people are going to do a
[13:35] Bitcoin treasury as a just shove it on
[13:38] the as a PR announcement. Hopefully
[13:40] it'll get our stock price up, get a bit
[13:42] of liquid trading going on, but then the
[13:45] market will see through it. So, it's
[13:47] that consistent buyer, that consistent
[13:49] market uh signal to the market saying,
[13:51] "We're here. We're buyers every week,
[13:53] month, two months." Um, and the market
[13:57] is smart enough and it will understand
[13:58] who is a real player and who's not.
[14:01] Yeah. It's also like when you see
[14:04] Scientific, when you see MetaPlanet,
[14:05] when you see strategy, they are not only
[14:08] just buying, they are buying a good
[14:10] amount and they're going to the Bitcoin
[14:12] conferences. They really also
[14:13] interacting with the community. They're
[14:16] doing more than just like, hey, like
[14:18] posting a tweet, hey, we're buying
[14:19] Bitcoin now. We have Bitcoin company
[14:21] now. Come, come to us, trade with us.
[14:23] They're doing a lot more than than just
[14:24] like small action. And that that takes
[14:27] time. I think that's a position that as
[14:30] Coinsium or not speaking on behalf of
[14:32] Coinsium, but from my view, um that's
[14:35] probably somewhere that we want to get
[14:36] to down the road, but we're we're two
[14:39] weeks into our into our strategy. So, um
[14:43] it takes time. And look, we we've got
[14:46] the experience and the the the
[14:48] capabilities of understanding the market
[14:50] really well. They've be they were the
[14:52] first ever blockchain company to IPO in
[14:54] the world globally. They've had Bitcoin
[14:57] on the balance sheet since 2015. So, um
[15:00] they've survived three bare markets. Um
[15:03] which was one of the reasons I joined
[15:04] them because I really believed in uh
[15:07] they understood hedging downside risk.
[15:10] they knew how to when a bare market
[15:12] eventually comes in the next cycle,
[15:14] they'll know how to manage it. So that
[15:16] gave me a lot of assurances. Um
[15:19] but yeah, it's it's one thing just
[15:22] buying and then it's the next thing is
[15:24] creating the awareness and really uh
[15:27] honing in on your strategy. You said UK
[15:30] is kind of four years uh like one full
[15:33] year cycle behind of the election cycle
[15:36] behind the US. Is that generally or
[15:38] directionally also true for whole of
[15:40] Europe? Um well there was actually um an
[15:44] article today. So Jackabe um they're a
[15:48] Bitcoin ETF. Uh they just got uh access
[15:51] to the retail market for Europe. They
[15:53] they hold a small amount of AUM. Um but
[15:57] we're starting to see small
[15:58] breakthroughs within Europe. Um
[16:02] again, yeah, Europe is the is the is the
[16:05] continent known for red tape and legal
[16:09] uh barriers and lawyers and everything's
[16:11] very bure bureaucratic and slow.
[16:15] Um and it's very similar to the UK. So
[16:17] yeah, I think the UK and Europe are
[16:19] probably very close in how under exposed
[16:23] they are to Bitcoin. Um but what gives
[16:26] me hope is that you look at all the
[16:29] other investment classes uh or asset
[16:31] classes uh out there and they're all
[16:33] performing terribly. Uh real estate in
[16:36] the UK is which pretty much underpins
[16:39] the economy. Uh in a real on a real
[16:42] terms basis is definitely down about 15
[16:45] 20% from the top. nominal. Um,
[16:49] yeah, it's also down. As I said, UK
[16:52] equities haven't performed for 20, 25
[16:54] years. Um, so people and bonds are as
[16:58] bad as anything. Um, a guilt crisis is
[17:01] on the horizon. So, everyone is now
[17:05] questioning where to put their money.
[17:06] You can't leave it really in cash
[17:08] anymore because inflation's compounding
[17:10] at 15 20% a year. So gold is capital
[17:14] gains tax-free in this country. Um it is
[17:19] m it is considered money in this
[17:21] country. Um so a lot of it will go into
[17:24] gold but I do expect Bitcoin becoming
[17:26] this mature institutionalized
[17:28] financialized asset. Now we will see one
[17:32] to three to 5% of that money that should
[17:34] have gone into gold go into Bitcoin. Um,
[17:38] and yeah, it's only around it's around
[17:41] 780,000 pounds for one Bitcoin. So,
[17:44] we're not even at six figures yet
[17:46] because the pound's quite strong
[17:47] relatively. Um, so again, the the room
[17:51] for growth in this country is huge for
[17:54] uh price appreciation. It's super
[17:57] interesting to see the institutional
[17:58] adoption of of Bitcoin. I I talked to uh
[18:02] three different uh German speaking uh
[18:05] bitcoin exchanges, bitcoin only
[18:06] exchanges and they all have a a company
[18:09] side of things. So like for retail but
[18:10] also for B2B uh for companies wanting to
[18:13] buy Bitcoin, private companies in that
[18:15] sense. And when I talk to them and their
[18:18] lists of like how many companies there
[18:21] are out there that really want to buy
[18:22] Bitcoin and they're buying Bitcoin and
[18:25] about half of them or sometimes like
[18:26] more than half of them have a policy of
[18:29] like hey you cannot tell anyone. We
[18:31] don't want anyone to know that we even
[18:33] have Bitcoin. We just think Bitcoin is a
[18:35] great asset but we don't want to talk
[18:37] about it publicly. Do do you see that
[18:40] also sometimes in in the market in the
[18:41] UK and what what you're seeing of like a
[18:43] lot of companies want to do it but like
[18:46] they're afraid of uh uh what might
[18:49] happen when they out uh are outspoken
[18:51] about it. Yeah. So I know multiple uh
[18:55] private limited companies that have
[18:57] thousands of bitcoin on the balance
[18:59] sheet. Um they don't want to go public
[19:01] because they don't want to be known. Um
[19:04] I was at the mic strategy conference in
[19:05] April May. Um three uh CEOs came up to
[19:10] me uh said they had literally about
[19:13] 1,500 to 2,000 Bitcoin on their balance
[19:15] sheets, but they don't want to go
[19:17] public. They didn't know what to do with
[19:18] it. How can they capitalize on that on
[19:20] having such a robust balance sheet? So
[19:23] yeah, there is a um there is an issue of
[19:26] going of being public with with Bitcoin.
[19:28] It's not always a great thing. Um, so
[19:33] yeah, it has it its advantages and
[19:35] disadvantages, but I think once the
[19:39] people can see with with these, we're
[19:42] seeing a lot of spaxs. We're seeing a
[19:43] lot of reverse takeovers on the NASDAQ.
[19:46] Um, I think we need to see a lot of
[19:49] success with them, uh, not just pump and
[19:51] dumps. So, if we can see uh these
[19:54] companies be successful as Bitcoin
[19:56] Treasury companies, then I think a lot
[19:58] more people um will go public. Um but
[20:03] we're still very early on. Uh the
[20:05] Bitcoin Treasury's website's great
[20:07] because you can track all these public
[20:08] companies and it's growing at like 5 10
[20:12] public companies pretty much a week. Um
[20:16] I think it was over 120 as of today. Um,
[20:20] and it's grown like 30 companies in the
[20:22] past month and you keep that number
[20:24] going. So I think Sailor wanted like in
[20:27] the next 12 months like 500 or something
[20:30] and I think that's quite possible the
[20:32] higher the price goes. Um, so yeah, it's
[20:35] definitely a trend that has just
[20:38] started.
[20:39] What do you think they are fearing like
[20:41] what is holding them them back to not
[20:43] announce it? Um, you don't want to come
[20:46] in, buy the top, and then the price
[20:49] drops 30%. Like, you want to come in,
[20:52] buy at 76 in April, announce you've
[20:56] bought 76, and the price is at 110,
[21:00] you're up 30, 40% from the bottoms. So,
[21:04] uh, that that's what's ideal because
[21:06] everyone's got an ego. But again, like
[21:08] we look, I I study the price every day.
[21:11] There is no way to time this market.
[21:13] that you can get in to an extent and you
[21:15] can feel you can you can get in when you
[21:17] can feel there's real capitulation in
[21:19] the market but that may not come for a
[21:21] while. So sometimes you just have to
[21:23] take your medicine and just be like I'm
[21:25] coming in I'm buying it at this price
[21:27] we're going to be consistent buyers and
[21:29] if you if you hold for a minimum of four
[21:31] years you'll you'll be in you'll be up.
[21:34] Um, so I think people need to have a
[21:36] long-term time frame, but once you have
[21:38] shareholders um in your company, it it
[21:42] becomes a lot harder. If you don't
[21:43] perform straight away, people will just
[21:45] disappear and rotate into other treasury
[21:47] companies. I'm curious on what you think
[21:49] about that because since ever since I'm
[21:51] in Bitcoin since 2020, I always felt
[21:53] there is u from the people that are into
[21:56] Bitcoin, but maybe they have a CFO
[21:57] position in the company or they have
[21:59] some position in the company where they
[22:01] could influence things like that. They
[22:03] always had that risk of the career
[22:06] that's like, okay, if I'm a CFO and then
[22:08] I'm adopting Bitcoin, what if I pick a
[22:11] wrong time and one year is is performing
[22:13] bad? I'm I'm getting kicked out. I feel
[22:16] slowly slowly that career risk kind of
[22:18] disappearing or like maybe even like
[22:20] flipping to from flipping I think we are
[22:23] some some years away from it. uh but the
[22:25] career risk is slowly slowly
[22:26] disappearing where it's more and more
[22:30] acceptable because there are a lot of
[22:32] examples like strategy and other
[22:34] companies that have done it and they're
[22:36] like oh like it works obviously if you
[22:38] do it right um and this is just like my
[22:42] thing of like once we get fully once we
[22:45] have enough good examples of that this
[22:48] career risk will completely disappear
[22:50] maybe even flip to the other side of
[22:51] like why don't you have a Bitcoin
[22:53] strategy and this will be like the the
[22:55] full accelerator of institutional
[22:57] adoption. Yeah. And I think that we're
[23:00] still very very far off it. We're we're
[23:03] talking about a handful of companies
[23:05] adopting a strategy
[23:08] um properly. Not just announcing like
[23:10] taking on the full strategy. We're
[23:12] probably still worth I would expect it
[23:14] maybe in the next cycle. I think this is
[23:16] the iteration the first second iteration
[23:19] of it. Um but it's great to see globally
[23:23] this is everyone's trying to be
[23:25] everyone's waking up to this but yeah I
[23:27] do believe the the the career risk is uh
[23:31] is starting. So I've had accountancy
[23:34] firms in the UK reach out to me asking
[23:37] me if they wanted to do our uh our
[23:41] accountancy uh our accountancy numbers.
[23:45] Uh and these are traditional companies
[23:47] within London who would never touch
[23:49] crypto in a million years. So they're
[23:52] looking at it now. Uh even back in 2021
[23:57] when I I used to work for a toy
[23:59] manufacturer
[24:01] um on the uh on the S&P 500 Hasbro and
[24:06] the day I left cuz I went into Bitcoin
[24:10] after that. I said the day I left their
[24:12] share price was at $100. Um they had
[24:15] about I think a couple of hundred
[24:17] million maybe a billion dollars worth of
[24:18] cash on the balance sheet. I was like
[24:20] you should buy some Bitcoin and put it
[24:22] on the balance sheet. Um
[24:24] and the UK CEO um told me you should
[24:27] just stop wasting my time. Um and he
[24:31] actually told me to leave early because
[24:33] he said I was he thought I was actually
[24:34] on purposely wasting his time. Um the
[24:37] share price is now uh $50 um at Hasbro.
[24:43] So um and that's what 6 years later four
[24:46] four years later. So um I think the
[24:50] smaller companies
[24:52] uh the the especially the zombie
[24:53] companies that Micro Strategy have
[24:55] alluded to or Sema Scientific have
[24:57] alluded to, they're the ones that need
[24:59] it because if you're not in the S&P 500,
[25:02] if you're not a Magnificent 7 company,
[25:04] you are not going to get a look in
[25:06] anywhere. So yeah, like again, I only
[25:08] only heard of Mic Strategy in the 2000
[25:11] tech bust.
[25:13] So without Bitcoin, you wouldn't get
[25:14] noticed. So yeah, you'll find some
[25:17] charlatans in this space that will just
[25:19] say, I'm part of Bitcoin and blah blah,
[25:22] but long enough time frame, the market
[25:24] will wash them away. Um, so I I do
[25:27] believe that the smart people do see um
[25:32] a a career risk. Larry think he um he
[25:37] completely sidestepped he was calling it
[25:39] a Ponzi scheme and everything under the
[25:41] sun. He he launched an ETF. He's now one
[25:44] of our biggest advocates. And the the
[25:46] next one to flip will be Jamie Diamond.
[25:48] And you can see how over time he has
[25:50] changed his tune to an extent. His
[25:52] latest comments were I'll let my clients
[25:55] JP Morgan will offer Bitcoin custody
[25:57] services or whatever it is to it um
[26:00] because he has to because his clients
[26:02] are demanding it. But he's still like
[26:04] it's still a Ponzi scheme. So until JP
[26:08] Morgan needs it existentially, he'll
[26:11] still say no. It's it's fascinating to
[26:14] see the narrative uh changing. I mean
[26:16] Sailor himself was once against Bitcoin.
[26:18] I mean not really big, but he made some
[26:20] tweets. Larry F is is probably like a
[26:23] better example where he really al
[26:25] outspoken in in in TVs and Jamie Diamond
[26:28] would be a big one. like if Jamie
[26:29] Diamond comes out and and says good
[26:31] stuff about Bitcoin like Larry Frink is
[26:33] now saying uh and those things but yeah
[26:36] we kind of see the media narrative
[26:38] really changing now. Yeah. And it's also
[26:41] traditional media that again in the UK
[26:44] no one trusts the BBC. Um the Financial
[26:48] Times are a joke. I I don't know if you
[26:51] saw that interview with that woman and
[26:53] Michael Sailor when she when she goes to
[26:55] him, but my teeth are scarce. Like the
[26:59] these organizations aren't really
[27:00] serious anymore. And the power of
[27:02] Twitter and the power of like your
[27:04] podcast is you you can just do it and
[27:08] put it online and anyone can see it. No
[27:10] one's telling you what to do or you
[27:11] don't you don't need a degree. You don't
[27:13] need to be told, oh, I need to do this
[27:15] or I need to do that. Break Bitcoin just
[27:16] breaks all the barriers down. Um so the
[27:19] trust within the institutional media
[27:21] side is completely uh dead. Um and it it
[27:25] allows your podcast and other podcasts
[27:27] and other media services just to rise
[27:29] and it allows the individual to choose
[27:31] what they want not to be force-fed to
[27:34] the BBC or other institutions. The first
[27:37] time I ever made any money, I got myself
[27:39] from that money a watch. And ever since
[27:42] then I collect time pieces to remember
[27:44] times where I achieved some milestone.
[27:47] That's why I got the Bitcoin 2025
[27:50] edition when I went to my first ever
[27:53] American Bitcoin conference. So for me,
[27:55] the Bitcoin watches from Coin Vichilan
[27:58] represents the time that we are living
[28:00] in. For every person that wears a
[28:02] Bitcoin watch, I know they are
[28:04] representing sound money to the outside
[28:08] world. Make sure to check out those
[28:10] amazing coin vigilante time pieces down
[28:13] in the descriptions. I love those
[28:15] watches so so much. I know how big of a
[28:18] hurdle it can be to have self-custody,
[28:21] but it's so freaking important to make
[28:24] that first step. We have to make sure
[28:26] it's as easy and simple as possible. And
[28:30] that's exactly what BitBox did. Bitbox
[28:33] created the simplest and the easiest
[28:36] hard wallet to use to get into self
[28:39] custody. So get yourself a Bitbox down
[28:42] from the link in the description. And
[28:44] when you use code Robin, you even get a
[28:46] 5% discount. Most people realize that
[28:50] way, way, way too late. If you have
[28:53] Bitcoin, you have to have a self-custody
[28:55] hardware wallet. But what are you doing
[28:57] if that hardware wallet breaks? Yeah,
[28:59] you wrote your seed phrase on paper.
[29:02] What if that paper is just dissolving or
[29:05] water spilled on top of it? Paper is
[29:08] very, very nondurable. So you have to
[29:10] have a fire resistant, water resistant,
[29:13] and impact proof method of securing your
[29:16] seat phrase so you can back up your
[29:19] keys. And to do that, you should use a
[29:22] solid titanium plate from stamp seed. Go
[29:25] to stampseed.com
[29:27] and use code robin to get not five or
[29:30] 10, but 15% off your stamp seed. The
[29:36] most important thing for your Bitcoin
[29:38] journey is not buying Bitcoin, but it's
[29:41] how to keep them. And yes, you have
[29:43] maybe the right tools, but how do you
[29:45] actually go ahead and stick it all
[29:47] together so it's the most secure for you
[29:50] personally? Self- custo
[29:57] finding that correct setup for you
[30:00] personally. They're also helping you
[30:02] with securing your own cyber security.
[30:05] And if you want to go one step above all
[30:08] that, you can even get a consultation
[30:11] for a plan B residency. Go to the
[30:14] bitcoinway.com/roin
[30:17] and you will get a 30inut free
[30:20] consultation. It's so funny because
[30:22] mainstream media is saying exactly the
[30:25] opposite of like those internet medias,
[30:28] podcast, Twitter is spreading the fake
[30:30] news and they should trust them because
[30:32] it's like they are the established ones
[30:35] and they are the truthful and like no
[30:37] actually like if you look at the facts
[30:39] you you're spreading a lot of fake news.
[30:41] Um not in maybe not intentionally but
[30:43] like you definitely do. Uh you can look
[30:45] at past examples. Uh and yeah, of course
[30:48] there's a lot of fake news on the
[30:49] internet. like it's it's an open
[30:51] protocol. Of course, there will be dumb
[30:53]  and good on there. Uh but
[30:56] yeah, I think facts are spreading faster
[30:58] and faster than ever and and it's it's a
[31:02] really good time to be alive because you
[31:04] can you don't need anything. Um and you
[31:08] can just inform yourself on the first
[31:11] source on the primary source. You don't
[31:12] have to go to the secondary or third uh
[31:16] source. you can really look at the the
[31:17] the one um one video like I I locked a
[31:21] lot the um I think it was also um about
[31:24] the UK actually JD Vanza's speech in
[31:26] Germany where he talked about the UK and
[31:28] the freedom of speech and I heard just
[31:31] on mainstream media how they were
[31:33] talking about it and I was like he he
[31:35] went in there and dumped all over Europe
[31:37] and then I actually was like oh I should
[31:39] listen to the actual speech. The actual
[31:41] speech was actually kind of harmless
[31:42] like he he did not say anything bad. He
[31:44] just like said like one two examples
[31:46] that actually happened and so primary
[31:49] resources and and uh individual
[31:52] journalism podcasting whatever you want
[31:53] to call it is really I think really good
[31:56] for the world. Yeah it is. And uh people
[31:59] are if you speak out on social media in
[32:02] the UK people have been put in prison
[32:04] for going against the UK establishment.
[32:07] Um, but I think what we're going to see
[32:10] in these next four years, reforms
[32:13] supposedly are getting all the the love
[32:16] and attention at the moment. Uh, that's
[32:18] led by Nigel Farage. Um, I'm very
[32:21] skeptical on any UK politician. So, um,
[32:24] I'll have to believe it when I see it.
[32:26] But again, a bit like the Democrats that
[32:28] have completely uh, died. The Tory, the
[32:31] Conservative Party in the UK have died.
[32:34] uh and the Labour Party will be
[32:35] completely irrelevant within the next
[32:37] four years. So, it kind of is what is
[32:40] going to be left of the UK in four years
[32:42] time. God only knows. Um but it kind of
[32:45] you're looking at reform being like you
[32:47] guys can't really mess this up at this
[32:49] point. Um so yeah, it's um there was a
[32:55] stat that China are the number one
[32:57] surveillance state in the world. The
[32:59] second is the UK.
[33:02] It's not something you want to be
[33:04] compared to. No. And a lot of debanking
[33:07] has been going on in the UK. Uh Nigel
[33:09] Farage, again, he's been debanked. So,
[33:11] he's obviously an advocate for Bitcoin
[33:13] and cryptocurrencies.
[33:15] So, um I think the more totalitarian the
[33:19] country gets um because they can't allow
[33:22] wealth to escape. But even though we've
[33:25] got the most millionaires leaving, we
[33:26] got the nondoms leaving because they're
[33:28] putting taxes up too much. And you've
[33:31] got the Laffer curve which implies you
[33:33] put taxes up too much. It does it
[33:36] actually regresses GDP. Um and they part
[33:40] of cap capital gains tax which is
[33:42] actually seeing less income going into
[33:43] the treasury. So all these idiotic
[33:45] policies that they're doing are going to
[33:48] make the issues and situations worse in
[33:51] the UK, more money leaving the country.
[33:54] So again, why they don't like Bitcoin is
[33:57] Bitcoin I can get up and just leave.
[34:00] Where if I had a property is property is
[34:02] kind of a capital control. It allows
[34:03] money to stay within the country within
[34:05] the borders. Bitcoin is completely the
[34:07] opposite. They can't obviously regulate
[34:09] it, can't control it. So it I think
[34:12] positioning ourselves now um in the UK
[34:16] as a Bitcoin treasury
[34:18] um or having a Bitcoin treasury really
[34:22] um will give you huge amounts of growth
[34:24] over this next four years.
[34:26] How do you look at Michael Farage? Uh I
[34:29] saw him at the Bitcoin conference uh
[34:31] speaking and I I have like zero to no
[34:34] clue about UK policies. So I know the
[34:38] name but I don't really know for what
[34:40] he's standing for and and what his
[34:42] stance also on Bitcoin is. Um so I've
[34:44] met him a couple of times. Um he is he's
[34:50] very look to me he's very intelligent
[34:52] and he's a great speaker. Um
[34:55] does that mean I believe every word he
[34:57] says? No. Um, but yeah, it's a look, he
[35:01] says a lot of he look, he says
[35:02] everything that you want to hear, but we
[35:05] all know the situ a bit like Trump. Like
[35:07] he'll tell you everything you want to
[35:09] hear, but when you actually get into it,
[35:10] like the rep the the Republicans got a
[35:12] majority and look how hard it is for him
[35:14] to get his policies across. So like even
[35:17] if Farage says we'll do this, this, and
[35:19] this like actually when you're in the
[35:20] hot seat, there is nothing you can do.
[35:23] We saw that with Liz Truss in 2022. who
[35:25] she tried to get her policies across uh
[35:28] and the bond market ate her up. They um
[35:30] they there was literally a coup on this
[35:32] trust, chucked her out. So I I I don't
[35:37] really know what you can do. You have to
[35:39] kind of restructure the government. Um
[35:42] which becomes almost impossible. So it
[35:44] doesn't I don't think it really much
[35:46] matters who's in charge or what policies
[35:47] they have because you're kind of pulling
[35:49] on the same strings or you're throwing a
[35:51] bit of money here instead of there. It's
[35:54] the same. It's the same fiat Ponzi
[35:56] issue. You got to continue to spend. So,
[36:00] um yeah, it's also the question of how
[36:03] much does it matter if you're a
[36:05] Bitcoiner and you are way more movable
[36:09] uh than any other one with any other
[36:10] property, you you can if if really if it
[36:13] hits the fan in your country, obviously
[36:15] you don't want to leave your family and
[36:16] all all of all of those things, but at
[36:18] least with Bitcoin, you have the
[36:19] possibility to actually go ahead and
[36:21] just go. Yeah. It gives you full
[36:23] optionality
[36:25] um which is so important in today's
[36:27] world and there there's no way that you
[36:29] could seriously buy a property
[36:32] um and get into half a million pounds
[36:34] worth of debt and struggle to pay that
[36:37] off the rest of your life. The taxes
[36:39] will go up. Um so yeah, you really have
[36:41] to think about what I actually want now.
[36:44] Um because in four years time you may
[36:46] not even really get a choice. So um
[36:49] Bitcoin gives you that full optionality
[36:51] and freedom. Um, and it's you're
[36:54] essentially voting with Bitcoin. Um,
[36:56] which is so important. So, um, yeah, I
[36:59] haven't really I don't even think I've
[37:00] voted in the previous elections. Um, I I
[37:05] don't really have an interest until
[37:07] someone conclusively comes out and is
[37:09] pro Bitcoin. Still haven't seen that
[37:11] with reform, but that could change.
[37:15] Yeah, one one cycle behind in America
[37:18] was also hard to see like two three
[37:20] years ago. Uh, and now it's like, oh
[37:23]  like they they're really uh
[37:24] positive now on Bitcoin and crypto. And
[37:27] maybe we see 2028 two candidates in the
[37:31] American election they fight who is the
[37:33] real Bitcoiner. Like that would be fun
[37:35] to see. Yeah, that would be a pace of
[37:38] change. Definitely. Yeah. Like who
[37:40] knows? Um, but yeah, it's it's waiting
[37:45] and seeing at this point. Absolutely. Uh
[37:47] one more thing uh on institutional side
[37:50] I think is interesting maybe for for
[37:52] people to to know I don't know how much
[37:54] information or insights you you have on
[37:55] that but how does the custody for
[37:58] institutions look like for publicly
[37:59] traded company like obviously like
[38:01] there's not like one guy that holds the
[38:03] keys um is it always with like some
[38:06] partner like I think Coinbase in America
[38:08] a lot or the companies that actually
[38:10] hold the keys themselves I don't know
[38:12] like it's a multisig with like 12 people
[38:14] or something like that. Yeah, I I can't
[38:16] speak on behalf of Coinsium on how they
[38:19] on how they custody. Uh I'm only an
[38:21] adviser, but looking from the outside as
[38:24] a just a general retail and seeing how
[38:26] Micro Strategy or uh the other public
[38:28] companies do it. Uh they spread their
[38:31] their coins across multiple custodians.
[38:33] Um so they Mic Strategy have Coinbase,
[38:36] Prime and uh Fidelity. So they try and
[38:39] spread the risk. Um, we also have the
[38:41] the discussion of proof of reserves uh
[38:44] that MetaPlanet do that strategy don't
[38:46] do. Um, I don't believe the proof of
[38:50] reserves is a bigger deal as people are
[38:52] making out. They are a publicly traded
[38:54] company. They are audited. Um, they have
[38:57] to comply with the SEC. Um, Michael
[39:00] Sailor is a billionaire. Um, I don't see
[39:03] the risk of why he would try and play
[39:06] around with his coins. um that like the
[39:09] the upside is just not big enough if you
[39:12] know what I mean. Like why would he try
[39:14] and manipulate or not be transparent?
[39:18] He's a public company so I don't really
[39:20] see an issue with that. Yeah. He he
[39:22] would basically play with the SEC and
[39:26] commit fraud and if that comes out he
[39:29] goes in prison if I'm informed
[39:31] correctly. Yeah. So where's the upside
[39:34] in that? Um so no it's a non-issue. Um
[39:37] every company
[39:39] uh can do what they want. Um but as long
[39:42] as you're abiding by the the
[39:45] jurisdiction that you are in then that
[39:47] is absolutely fine. Um but we saw with
[39:51] Coinbase Prime recently that uh there
[39:53] was like a data breach and people's data
[39:57] uh got leaked. Um so there there are
[40:01] concerns. Coinbase hold I think two to
[40:04] three million Bitcoin. Um, so it's a
[40:07] significant amount. So again, that's
[40:09] another another centralized concern that
[40:12] all the ETF issuers uh mainly Black
[40:15] Rockck hold it in Coinbase. Um, so you
[40:18] have to start looking at all these
[40:19] centralized concerns. Um, do I trust
[40:22] Coinbase?
[40:24] I think on whole you have to, but also
[40:27] their their their their
[40:29] activities over the past make them hard
[40:32] to trust with all their with all their
[40:34] degenerate crypto memecoin and listings
[40:38] and everything like that. Um,
[40:41] so yeah, it's it's it's you have to just
[40:44] take them for their word, which is not
[40:45] really the ethos of Bitcoin.
[40:48] It it was fun to see when Brian
[40:50] Armstrong, who sells a lot of coins
[40:52] on on Coinbase,
[40:54] um is going ahead and then informing the
[40:57] president, oh, it should be Bitcoin only
[40:59] the strategic reserve and he comes
[41:01] publicly out. How did you actually like
[41:03] the the strategic Bitcoin reserve and
[41:05] how this kind of shaked out till now? Um
[41:08] well, it started not with a strategic
[41:10] Bitcoin reserve. It started with a
[41:12] strate strategic Bitcoin reserve and
[41:15] cryptocurrencies.
[41:16] Um, and then I think it got walked back
[41:20] and then it just became a strategic
[41:21] Bitcoin reserve. But the challenge is
[41:25] Trump doesn't want to um put any more
[41:29] cost to the taxpayer. Um, so they have
[41:32] to find it in a deltaneutral budget
[41:34] neutral way and what we're four five
[41:37] months since that and nothing's really
[41:40] happened. And JD Vance all elude no
[41:42] sorry David Sachs alluded we're still
[41:44] looking for budget neutral ways and it's
[41:46] like
[41:47] if you haven't come up with ideas now
[41:49] you probably aren't coming up with
[41:50] ideas. Um I think crypto seizures are
[41:54] probably the best idea to get some money
[41:56] in. Um but yeah that's it's pretty
[42:01] concerning that after all these months
[42:03] they haven't found a way to to find a
[42:06] budget neutral strategy.
[42:09] just saying, "Yeah,
[42:11] it's also the Cindus bill and and all
[42:13] those those things uh going on. It's
[42:16] it's almost like the states are maybe
[42:19] going on faster than the than the than
[42:22] the federal government. Look, let I'm
[42:24] really looking forward to to how this
[42:26] how this things play plays out with with
[42:28] nations because I personally I'm I'm
[42:31] okay with nations not buying Bitcoin
[42:34] since I I want the individuals uh to
[42:37] have a longer chance to buying even
[42:38] though they had already had 16 years.
[42:40] Yeah, the the issue does become um
[42:45] where is this new money coming from to
[42:48] inflate the price higher? You've just
[42:51] had a vice president talk about Bitcoin
[42:53] or you had the president last year in
[42:55] his election campaign and it's like
[42:58] you've got nation states potentially
[43:00] buying hash rates at an all-time high.
[43:02] So we know I know that the UAE are
[43:05] mining Bitcoin with their renewable
[43:07] energy and um like you couldn't get more
[43:10] bullish news globally. I think Russia's
[43:13] biggest bank are doing a Bitcoin bond.
[43:16] Um, so it's like what else do you need
[43:19] for the price to go higher? The the
[43:22] options market is alluding to a to a
[43:24] surge in June, July. Um, but it doesn't
[43:29] look like it. Um, the onchain fees have
[43:31] just disappeared. No one's transacting
[43:35] in it. There looks to be a lack of use
[43:37] cases for Bitcoin. Not trying to sound
[43:39] like an absolute doomer. Um but without
[43:43] a narrative it becomes hard to see the
[43:46] price start to escalate. Um Micro
[43:50] Strategy are trying to go through many
[43:52] different alternatives on their
[43:53] preferred stock. Um they just did Stride
[43:57] which is their junk grade one.
[44:01] Uh and at the moment there's the lack of
[44:03] volatility in Mike Strategy. Um so
[44:06] that's why he can't issue any more um
[44:09] ATM on his common stock. But it's
[44:12] interesting to see the lack of
[44:13] volatility for mic strategy is a bad
[44:15] thing. But the Black Rockck ETF is also
[44:18] seeing a lack of volatility, but it's a
[44:20] good thing because institutional
[44:21] investors are I can invest in that
[44:24] because it's not as volatile. But the
[44:26] Mic Strategy investors need the
[44:28] volatility. So you could also say it the
[44:32] other way that we're over $100,000 for
[44:34] almost a month now. Um, and retail is
[44:38] just nowhere to be seen. There's no
[44:39] euphoria. There's no greed.
[44:42] We're just consolidating. So
[44:45] I guess yeah, look, there's no narrative
[44:48] per se at the moment, but I guess the
[44:50] bullish news is you're you're
[44:52] comfortably over 100,000, which would
[44:53] have been a dream
[44:56] whenever 5 10 years ago.
[44:59] That's that's a good point of like you
[45:02] don't have any retail form whatsoever
[45:04] and we are just comfortable sitting over
[45:07] 100k and it's very calm around around
[45:10] Bitcoin. That's a it's a it's a good
[45:12] aspect actually. Um I have one question
[45:14] that asked each and every one of my
[45:16] guests and the the question is what can
[45:18] we learn from you besides Bitcoin? Um
[45:21] well I do a lot of data analysis and AI
[45:23] mainly for Bitcoin but um no it's
[45:27] understanding the markets macro
[45:30] um and then yeah I spend a lot of time
[45:33] in AI doing data analysis and leveraging
[45:37] AI because I think AI is probably more
[45:39] important than Bitcoin. I think um I
[45:43] think the fiat Ponzi scheme only works
[45:46] like when the internet came it changed
[45:49] everything and now with AI I believe it
[45:51] changes everything because governments
[45:53] can't control AI and if you use these
[45:57] tools on every given daily basis like
[46:00] your learning just multiplies by 10x and
[46:04] you become more efficient you become
[46:05] faster it's just incredible to see it so
[46:08] yeah it's It's maybe my proficiency
[46:11] within the AI uh tools. Interesting. How
[46:14] do you think AI can or will if at all
[46:18] impact Bitcoin? Well, you've got quantum
[46:20] computing that's going to come. Um and
[46:24] Satoshi's keys become vulnerable.
[46:27] Um I think that becomes an existential
[46:30] threat to Bitcoin. Um I think they will
[46:33] be hacked. Um,
[46:36] I don't think it there's a way of
[46:39] Bitcoin's proof of work. So, if you make
[46:42] if you do the work and you and you um
[46:45] and you take and you break his keys
[46:47] through quantum, I think there's a
[46:50] there's a valid reason saying that's
[46:52] fine because you've worked to do it. But
[46:54] then the other thing becomes how
[46:56] existential does it become for more the
[46:58] earlier coins as well. Um, so look, I
[47:01] don't know what the answer is to that
[47:02] and it's probably a discussion that's
[47:04] needed. Um, but that becomes the obvious
[47:06] threat within the next
[47:09] four to six years, I reckon.
[47:12] Interesting. Yeah, I think it's
[47:14] something that uh get gets talked about,
[47:17] but probably not a lot in uh on like
[47:21] podcasts and like uh on like public
[47:24] spaces. It's more like some um more like
[47:27] experts talking. Yeah. Um because no one
[47:30] wants to talk about it because it's it's
[47:32] an existential threat. So um yeah,
[47:36] that's my main concern. Um and uh yeah,
[47:39] I would like more people talking about
[47:41] it. Yeah, very important. Uh we have an
[47:43] entrine in the podcast where the
[47:45] previous guest is asking a question for
[47:47] the next guest without knowing who the
[47:48] next guest actually is and the previous
[47:50] guest asks you the question, what tools
[47:53] do Bitcoiners need to educate the next
[47:55] class of of Bitcoiners? tools. Um, I
[47:59] would go on the uh
[48:02] I'd go on the strategy micro strategy
[48:04] dashboard. Um, it's not per se for
[48:07] Bitcoin is more it's it's to educate
[48:11] Bitcoiners within the financial markets.
[48:13] As much as Bitcoiners don't want to be
[48:15] partaking in financial markets, Bitcoin
[48:18] is now a financialized asset. So um
[48:21] going on the mic strategy dashboard
[48:24] looking at how the share price moves or
[48:27] understanding all his preferred stock or
[48:29] his convertible notes and understanding
[48:31] how they will operate I think is really
[48:33] important.
[48:35] Really really cool. Yeah absolutely I
[48:37] agree with uh interesting uh all all the
[48:40] the data that they're delivering to us.
[48:43] Um before I let you go where can people
[48:45] find you ask your questions and and
[48:46] reach out to you? Yeah, I'm on uh X
[48:51] Twitter on BTCJVS and I also write
[48:54] articles on CoinDesk. Perfect. Thank you
[48:57] so much, James, for for being on and
[48:59] also thank you so much for everyone that
[49:00] is watching and listening for joining us
[49:02] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
[49:04] with another episode. Bye-bye.
