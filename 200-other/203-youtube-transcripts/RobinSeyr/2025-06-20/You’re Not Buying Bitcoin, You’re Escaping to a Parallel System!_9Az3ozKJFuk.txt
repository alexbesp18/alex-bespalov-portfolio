[00:00] You are so well conditioned to stay
[00:02] within those bounds that you can't
[00:05] conceptualize
[00:07] leaving to a parallel system that may
[00:09] work better for you. I don't think the
[00:12] education system, the institutional
[00:14] corporate America system or the monetary
[00:17] system based on debt benefits from
[00:19] anyone understanding Austrian economics.
[00:22] You and I are on the lifeboat already
[00:26] with a bottle of rosé and the people on
[00:29] the Titanic are looking at us and
[00:31] saying, "Look at those idiots. They fell
[00:34] off the ship." And what I've learned in
[00:37] dealing with families processing grief
[00:39] and loss is that at the end, the things
[00:42] that matter most is not money or your
[00:45] career. It's how did you treat your
[00:48] family, but they're not selling them to
[00:50] guys like you or me. They're selling
[00:52] them to Micro Strategy to Black Rockck
[00:55] and all these large institutions and
[00:57] money managers. And I think it's only a
[01:00] matter of time before that switch really
[01:02] hits people's brains and they start to
[01:04] understand, oh wow, this is all about to
[01:07] change and Bitcoin will take center
[01:09] stage.
[01:11] [Music]
[01:13] I've had a low time preference for
[01:16] Bitcoin
[01:17] and given the landscape changes in the
[01:22] past year, my time preference has just
[01:24] gotten lower.
[01:26] I think the the trajectory in the US has
[01:32] validated everything as a Bitcoiner I
[01:36] believed in for the previous few years.
[01:39] And I see
[01:42] political actors and large institutions
[01:46] saying
[01:48] what Bitcoiners have been saying
[01:51] for, you know, OG Bitcoiners for a
[01:55] decade, but I mean me and newer
[01:56] Bitcoiners for the like since 2020 and
[01:59] 2021 cycle. You know, the the debt is
[02:03] unsustainable. We're we're looking at in
[02:06] the face of a huge debt crisis. How can
[02:09] we sustain this? This is an untenable
[02:12] situation. We have to do something about
[02:15] this. And under the surface,
[02:19] Trump signs an executive order for a
[02:22] strategic Bitcoin reserve.
[02:25] um the talk of stable coins and
[02:28] integration of stable coins and crypto
[02:33] more broadly including Bitcoin being
[02:36] integrated and financialized in the US
[02:39] happening under the surface as that
[02:43] discussion of the untenable debt and
[02:47] looming monetary crisis kind of
[02:50] overhangs
[02:51] uh those conversations. So if you watch
[02:54] what they say, you listen to what they
[02:57] say and then watch what they do. So
[03:01] they're discussing huge debt issues,
[03:04] problems of the global monetary system,
[03:07] and then their actions are rolling out
[03:12] Bitcoin strategic reserve, discussing
[03:15] Bitcoin as a solution to debt issues,
[03:18] introducing stable coin legislation in
[03:21] the US. All of those things signal to me
[03:24] that this
[03:26] is not stopping and is actually
[03:29] accelerating. Um they don't type they
[03:32] don't talk about it with like tremendous
[03:35] excitement like Bitcoiners do cuz I
[03:37] think they have to be a bit more
[03:39] measured as you know institutional
[03:42] voices or political actors
[03:45] but the direction is the same. And it
[03:47] seems to me that the speed at which
[03:50] they're trying to make these changes is
[03:52] accelerating.
[03:54] So, I mean,
[03:56] and that that's great to see as a
[03:58] Bitcoiner.
[04:00] I think my only concern is the amount of
[04:06] normal people that still have uh
[04:12] poor views of Bitcoin because of you
[04:15] know bad actors like Sam Bankman Freed
[04:17] and the Celsius debactor debacle with
[04:20] Alex Mashinsky. I think that there's a
[04:23] lot of uh confusion about the difference
[04:26] between Bitcoin and crypto still because
[04:29] there hasn't been a big uh entrance from
[04:34] retail in the last year. the big the big
[04:38] entries have been, you know, OGs selling
[04:43] parts of their stack that they bought
[04:45] from, you know, $1 to $700,
[04:49] but they're not selling them to guys
[04:51] like you or me. They're selling them to
[04:53] Micro Strategy, to BlackRock, and all
[04:56] these large institutions and money
[04:58] managers that see this asset are trying
[05:01] to take those coins from strong
[05:04] long-term holders
[05:07] into institutions and not retail. And
[05:11] that tells me that, you know, there's
[05:13] probably still a lot of upside left to
[05:16] this
[05:17] uh market still because we haven't had
[05:20] any mania. We we got to $112,000
[05:26] here in the US a couple of weeks ago
[05:30] and not many of my friends knew or cared
[05:35] or were interested at all.
[05:38] and and that signal to me that this is,
[05:42] you know, kind of the least exciting
[05:45] all-time high that I've seen. I mean, I
[05:47] was excited. I'm sure you were excited.
[05:50] Um,
[05:52] but for the most part, it's still pretty
[05:55] low priority for most people. And I I
[05:58] and I couldn't believe it cuz I've been
[06:00] talking to them about it for a year and
[06:02] a half, getting them comfortable with
[06:04] the idea and the conversation. and then
[06:07] the price action kind of proves me
[06:09] right. Uh but still no interest to click
[06:13] the button and put it in the portfolio.
[06:17] That is super interesting and also um
[06:20] may maybe I think
[06:23] maybe to take uh a step back because
[06:26] maybe some people don't know you and I
[06:28] think you have a really interesting uh
[06:31] background also with the funeral home
[06:33] and and all the stories around that. Um
[06:36] then we can maybe also get into this
[06:38] discussion of time preference. Um so so
[06:41] maybe give the people some background uh
[06:43] who you are and what you're doing with
[06:45] with especially with the funeral because
[06:47] I think we can also have an interesting
[06:49] discussion with like time preference and
[06:51] seeing the death.
[06:53] Yeah. So uh my name's Will. I am a
[06:56] licensed funeral director in California.
[07:00] My uh family owned a large funeral home
[07:05] in crematory in Southern California for
[07:08] almost 50 years. And we sold that
[07:11] funeral home at the end of 2021,
[07:15] beginning of 2022.
[07:17] And at that time, I had uh a lot of time
[07:22] on my hands and a little bit of uh money
[07:25] from the sale of the business. And I
[07:30] I had been scammed on Celsius and lost
[07:34] Bitcoin on Celsius while working at the
[07:36] funeral home the year before. And
[07:41] I had a bit of money in my pocket and I
[07:45] said to myself, "Okay, I need to figure
[07:47] out how to invest this money. I've just
[07:50] spent 10 years of my life
[07:53] working extremely hard to help build my
[07:57] family's business and help families
[08:01] through grief and loss. And
[08:06] I ask myself the question, how can I
[08:09] store that time and energy most
[08:12] effectively
[08:14] so that
[08:16] I feel in the future
[08:19] that I've gotten the most out of the
[08:24] time and energy that I've already spent.
[08:27] So I want that time and energy to
[08:30] represent more for myself in the future
[08:33] rather than less because I can never get
[08:36] that time back.
[08:38] But I want
[08:40] to find the mechanism to preserve and
[08:44] grow it the most for the future because
[08:46] I don't if if if that money had been
[08:49] robbed of me through loss of purchasing
[08:52] power,
[08:54] I I would feel that that time that I'd
[08:56] already spent was being taken from me as
[08:59] if I had not done it.
[09:02] And
[09:03] that led me to a
[09:06] research expedition of crypto more
[09:10] broadly and then specifically Bitcoin as
[09:13] I kind of eliminated
[09:15] uh crypto from the the assets that
[09:19] actually would do what my goal was. So,
[09:24] I went on uh a big tear for Bitcoin
[09:28] content, crypto content, and all those
[09:31] sorts of things. And finally focused the
[09:34] vast majority of my time on reading
[09:38] about Bitcoin, listening to podcasts
[09:41] like yours on Bitcoin, and understanding
[09:44] what its purpose is now and in the
[09:47] future. So, I ended up putting a lot of
[09:49] that money from the sale of the business
[09:51] into Bitcoin.
[09:52] and um found it as the best savings tool
[09:57] for me for my time and energy uh that I
[10:01] could. And that's kind of been my
[10:03] journey uh since the sale. and I did
[10:06] consulting
[10:07] uh for funeral homes, new cremation
[10:10] businesses wanting to launch go to
[10:13] market strategies. And now I work for uh
[10:16] one of my clients who I'll probably end
[10:19] up getting a full-time job uh with in
[10:22] the next month or two is after.com.
[10:25] They're an onlinebased cremation service
[10:29] and I help open their business in new
[10:33] states within the US.
[10:36] So my job is to now travel to different
[10:39] markets in the US and look up the laws
[10:42] that are required to open a funeral
[10:45] establishment
[10:46] and find a piece of real estate that
[10:48] fits the laws, get the licensing so that
[10:52] we can open a funeral home there. So
[10:54] that that's what I do now. And it's a
[10:58] fun job for me. It's not a fun job for I
[11:01] imagine you know 99 out of a 100 people
[11:04] but for me I'm very good at it and it's
[11:06] right in my skill set and and I enjoy it
[11:11] and it's it's funny Robert because you
[11:13] know you hear uh Bitcoiners like have
[11:16] like kind of a bit crisis like they've
[11:19] kind of accumulated you know a stack and
[11:23] then price kind of runs away from them a
[11:25] bit and then you have this
[11:29] uh
[11:30] crisis where you say to yourself, you
[11:33] know, I'm probably not going to earn
[11:35] exponentially more money uh at my job.
[11:40] Like, I'll earn steadily more, but not
[11:42] exponentially more. So, you're looking
[11:44] at your stack and you realize that it's
[11:47] probably not going to change materially
[11:50] over the next, you know, 5 years or so,
[11:53] uh, just because price appreciation has
[11:55] kind of hit some sort of escape
[11:58] velocity. Um, you accumulating Bitcoin
[12:01] at, you know, 30 to 50,000's a lot
[12:04] better than 105 to 110,000, right? your
[12:10] your dollars go half as far in
[12:13] accumulation at at that stage. So I feel
[12:17] like my job now is kind of like
[12:21] almost like semi-retirement.
[12:24] Like I have a ve I have I'm very
[12:26] comfortable with my stack. I'll always
[12:28] accumulate more in small portions. But
[12:32] now this job has kind of been reframed
[12:35] to me as fun. like I don't have to worry
[12:40] about, you know, raise negotiations or,
[12:45] you know, vying for equity in the
[12:48] company. I can just do my job, be happy
[12:52] with it because I've saved in an asset
[12:57] that I know will preserve my time and
[13:00] energy well into the future. So I don't
[13:02] have to worry
[13:04] on a day-to-day basis how am I going to
[13:08] figure out how to manage my money, earn
[13:11] twice as much money or you know any type
[13:15] of
[13:17] speculative investment to save me from,
[13:20] you know, what's coming uh in the
[13:23] future. It's like I I I've done that
[13:25] work already and now I can kind of take
[13:30] uh pride in my work and handle it with,
[13:35] you know, more clarity and way more
[13:37] calmness because I've made the decision
[13:40] earlier to save my time and energy in
[13:43] something that I know is going to work
[13:44] for me.
[13:46] So, I work at this job for myself in
[13:49] spirit and I give it all I have with no
[13:53] worry because Bitcoin is working for me.
[13:57] That's beautiful and it's it's a it's a
[14:00] real I I mean, you're in a luxury
[14:03] situation if you're in this situation,
[14:05] but I've met some some Bitcoiners that
[14:07] have been in Bitcoin for a longer period
[14:09] of time and they've told me like, "Oh, I
[14:12] have X amount of Bitcoin. I have that
[14:14] earning capacity. I really have to
[14:17] invest aggressively in like making a
[14:19] company work or anything like that uh to
[14:22] out earn. So it actually makes a
[14:23] difference on my stack. At the same
[14:25] time, Bitcoin is growing exponentially
[14:28] faster. So, Bitcoin as the hurdle rate
[14:30] is really hard to to go after and your
[14:34] earning capacity is kind of lagging
[14:36] behind if you're not growing really fast
[14:40] or maybe you are in a special situation
[14:42] where if Bitcoin grows your business
[14:45] also grows which for example with my
[14:49] podcast with my mini small podcast
[14:52] business um I see if the price is really
[14:54] rising like interest is getting strong
[14:56] and like the podcast is getting strong
[14:58] and like sponsors have more money and
[15:00] all those things. So like um that's
[15:02] interesting, but outside of an special
[15:06] um outside of like being in the Bitcoin
[15:09] industry, you're probably not out
[15:11] earning Bitcoin. Yeah. Almost
[15:14] impossible. Almost impossible. You I
[15:16] mean you can, but it's like very hard
[15:19] and you have to be very successful
[15:20] either in your career or in a business.
[15:23] And this mid bit midlife crisis you call
[15:25] it, I never heard that. I love the term
[15:26] midlife crisis.
[15:28] That that's really really interesting
[15:30] and I want to get to like retiring on
[15:31] Bitcoin and how do you see that but
[15:34] maybe before that um how has
[15:38] being someone in a funeral home working
[15:41] there owning that doing that operating
[15:44] that impacted your time preference
[15:47] completely outside of Bitcoin? Yeah, I I
[15:51] think I think working in a funeral home
[15:54] is one of the best industries to kind of
[15:58] understand
[16:00] uh
[16:01] the the conceptual big picture Bitcoin
[16:05] ethos of low time preference. A lot a
[16:08] lot of Bitcoiners in my experience are
[16:13] very humble people who want to add more
[16:18] value to the world than they take from
[16:20] it. And as a fundamental concept for
[16:24] life, that is a good strategy. You know,
[16:27] give more than you take. Uh earn more
[16:31] than you spend.
[16:33] um
[16:35] as as a life philosophy in in my work at
[16:38] a at the funeral home, I talk to mostly
[16:41] people in their 70s, 80s, and 90s
[16:45] because those are the people who are
[16:47] near their the end of their life. And
[16:50] those people have a tremendous amount of
[16:52] wisdom if you if you engage in those
[16:55] conversations about life with them. And
[16:58] what I've learned in
[17:02] dealing with
[17:04] uh grief and loss and families
[17:07] processing grief and loss is that at the
[17:09] end the things that matter most is not
[17:13] money or your career. It's how did you
[17:18] treat your family? How did you nurture
[17:21] the the most important relationships in
[17:24] your life? How did you uh find healthy
[17:29] balance between work and play and make
[17:33] sure that you actually do save time for
[17:37] for play with those that you care about,
[17:40] your family, your children, your
[17:42] grandchildren.
[17:44] Uh because at the end of your life when
[17:47] you're looking back on all the time
[17:49] spent, you know, cuz everyone only gets
[17:52] a finite
[17:53] number of hours on this earth. The the
[17:58] only thing that's other than Bitcoin
[18:01] that's finite on this planet is your
[18:03] life. We all are going to to die at
[18:07] some, right? So our time is finite.
[18:12] There's there's a special
[18:16] um realization that after after I've
[18:19] heard you know hundreds of these you
[18:21] know points of wisdom that life is meant
[18:24] to be lived. It is not a constant search
[18:29] for financial gain and accumulation of
[18:32] wealth uh singularly. And I think a lot
[18:36] of people now because they're forced to
[18:39] in a debt-based monetary system based on
[18:42] fiat, they are forced to concentrate on
[18:47] the accumulation of wealth because if
[18:50] they don't then they will get inflated
[18:52] out of existence. So I understand why
[18:55] it's happening and I also know that
[18:58] that's
[18:59] not how human beings should have to
[19:02] operate and in a you know on a Bitcoin
[19:06] standard in the future I hope that
[19:10] people can explore more creative
[19:13] artistic
[19:14] or passionate endeavors for their career
[19:18] and life rather than you know being
[19:21] stuck at a job that they don't like just
[19:24] to make ends meet and make bill
[19:27] payments, right? Um, and I think now
[19:30] we're seeing more and more than ever
[19:32] that that is what families are forced
[19:35] into. You have
[19:37] more dual working households. You know,
[19:40] both parents have to work because
[19:42] everything's so expensive. It's no
[19:44] longer an option in in the state of the
[19:48] world. Um,
[19:50] and when I see how these people in their
[19:55] 70s and 80s and 90s got to live, you
[19:58] know, they could afford a home and food
[20:02] on the table, new clothes for school
[20:06] every year for the children and one or
[20:08] two vacations a year on one income.
[20:14] Now it's two incomes and you can barely
[20:18] afford them or you might have to give up
[20:21] one vacation
[20:23] um and you have to kind of sacrifice
[20:25] that uh for other necessary needs. So
[20:31] the the the gener two the baby boomers
[20:35] the silent generation have enjoyed a an
[20:38] existence that we don't get to enjoy
[20:42] anymore.
[20:43] But understanding that those
[20:46] relationships still matter and we should
[20:48] still be concentrating on on those,
[20:52] how do you solve for that problem so
[20:54] that your family doesn't have those
[20:56] issues? And to me, there's no better
[21:00] asset to store your time and energy for
[21:03] your fam your benefit and your family's
[21:05] benefit in 10 and 20 years than Bitcoin.
[21:09] So I I want to when I'm 55, you know, in
[21:15] a little over 20 years,
[21:17] I want my life to be cheaper in fiat
[21:21] terms. And Bitcoin is the only way that
[21:25] I see doing that and the best way I see
[21:28] doing that. And that will give me and my
[21:31] family the flexibility and optionality
[21:35] and freedom to do more of what we want,
[21:39] what we like than what we think that we
[21:42] have to do. Right? I I in my profession,
[21:46] I see a lot of noble people
[21:51] working a job for 40 years that they
[21:53] didn't like just to accumulate the
[21:56] wealth so that they could retire.
[21:59] And I I think Bitcoin flips that entire
[22:03] thing on its head, especially if you see
[22:06] it early, which I if we're if you've,
[22:09] you know, started a podcast business in
[22:13] this space, you see it and I see it too.
[22:17] And I think it's now about, you know,
[22:20] spreading this message to more people so
[22:23] that more people get it and more people
[22:25] have that flexibility, optionality, and
[22:28] freedom in the future.
[22:31] Yeah. And I think um most people even if
[22:34] even if you watch this podcast and
[22:36] you're still um not into Bitcoin, which
[22:40] probably like 2% of the viewers are
[22:43] because like why are you watching this
[22:45] podcast then? Um, but like there's
[22:47] always some new people, some small
[22:49] percentage of new people in. you like or
[22:51] everyone listening and watching this
[22:52] like they they see it, they saw it or at
[22:55] least they have an intuition of like hey
[22:57] there's something going on in the world
[23:00] and this can lead to
[23:04] I mean like number technology like we
[23:06] always know like oh like you can retire
[23:08] early on that but the implications of
[23:10] that is so fundamental because all of
[23:14] the sudden you get your life back. So
[23:17] sometimes we have make that mistake of
[23:19] like dismissing number go up technology
[23:21] of like oh like you're just in it for
[23:22] the money like yeah like Bitcoin is
[23:25] money so I'm in it for the money. So uh
[23:28] but I'm in in it for the implications
[23:31] because if I can retire my family on
[23:33] Bitcoin means I can uh be full-time
[23:37] there for my family. I can be full-time
[23:39] there for my wife for my kids. That's a
[23:42] whole game changer. So this retiring on
[23:46] Bitcoin is more important I think than
[23:49] uh we give it credit to and
[23:53] rightfully so a lot of people are
[23:54] interested in that topic. So how do you
[23:56] look at retiring on Bitcoin uh and and
[23:59] and how you approach that? I mean the
[24:02] best the best way of retiring is
[24:05] probably like earning something that you
[24:08] really love like um working in something
[24:10] that you really love. But not all not
[24:12] all people have that that luxury, right?
[24:15] I I I think
[24:18] I think in the US I think we need to
[24:21] uh redefine retirement. In my opinion, I
[24:26] think this
[24:28] this life cycle of born then in the
[24:33] school system for 22 years, then in the
[24:36] workforce for 40 to 45 years, and then a
[24:41] short 10year retirement where you leave
[24:44] your desk and don't do anything, wake up
[24:47] when you want and sit around and watch
[24:50] TV and watch the news and watch the
[24:53] world go by.
[24:54] uh is I don't think that's my definition
[24:58] of retirement. My definition of
[25:00] retirement is not to stop working but
[25:04] have the freedom to work on only the
[25:08] things that you care about and love that
[25:11] give you meaning in life. So
[25:15] I I I would love or maybe the and the
[25:19] optionality not to need the job rather
[25:22] than have to have the job and being
[25:25] financially secure enough that that you
[25:28] have that flexibility.
[25:30] So I I think about it for me personally
[25:35] um against the the programmed monetary
[25:40] policy of Bitcoin. So by 2035 99% of all
[25:46] Bitcoin will be mined and then we have
[25:50] theoretically
[25:52] an infinite time horizon where
[25:56] 99
[25:58] plus% will be in circulation. So
[26:02] essentially reaching that fixed supply
[26:05] uh over the next however many centuries
[26:09] right. So my personal choice is to take
[26:13] all discretionary fiat from my work and
[26:18] put it into Bitcoin with low time
[26:21] preference and accumulate
[26:25] monthly until probably 2030 or 2032.
[26:31] And then that that will be my my
[26:35] stacking phase will basically be run
[26:38] from 2020
[26:41] 1 2022 to 2030.
[26:44] So, I am completely focused with
[26:46] blinders on
[26:49] on making sure that all of my
[26:51] discretionary income goes into Bitcoin
[26:55] and thinking about the flexibility I
[26:58] have in 2030 or 2032
[27:03] and not not thinking about it too much
[27:06] until then because I like what I do. I
[27:11] enjoy the people I work with. I feel
[27:14] good about the value I'm giving to this
[27:16] company and to society through my work
[27:19] in this company. It aligns with my
[27:22] values.
[27:24] So, I don't need to really worry about
[27:27] anything else. And I'm singularly
[27:30] focused on that Bitcoin accumulation for
[27:33] that time frame. Um, and I'll pick my
[27:37] head up and reassess my options at the
[27:41] end of that
[27:43] time frame. Um, and I'll be in a better
[27:46] position then than I am today. And I and
[27:50] I feel very comfortable in that. So what
[27:54] what will I do in after 2030 or 2032? I
[27:57] don't know. I hope actually something in
[28:01] Bitcoin, you know, maybe a payments app,
[28:04] maybe custody solutions.
[28:07] I don't know. And right now I don't
[28:09] particularly have to know and I feel
[28:11] very comfortable not knowing cuz I like
[28:13] the work that I'm doing. Um, or maybe
[28:17] I'm in a position where I, you know,
[28:22] have a family and I want that family to
[28:26] live a different lifestyle than I'm
[28:28] living now or even that I grew up with.
[28:30] I grew up in the capital of the US,
[28:34] Washington DC. I was a city kid. Um, I
[28:38] kind of liked the idea of getting, you
[28:40] know, 10 or 20 acres.
[28:44] um maybe in Tennessee or Texas or
[28:47] Wyoming and, you know, making that my
[28:51] own oasis of self-sufficiency, chickens,
[28:55] maybe an herb garden, growing some
[28:57] vegetables,
[28:59] uh building ponds, uh and just kind of
[29:02] building my own little paradise,
[29:05] uh on Earth, and getting a little job in
[29:10] town. Um, one of my friends, his dad is
[29:13] retired and lives in Montana. He's done
[29:16] very well for himself. And to stay busy,
[29:20] he works at the local hardware store
[29:23] fixing grills. And he's happy. You know,
[29:27] he makes he he makes a very good living
[29:30] off of his retirement pension and
[29:33] doesn't need the money, but he enjoys
[29:35] fixing grills and having conversations
[29:38] with the guys that bring their broken
[29:40] grills in. And, you know, he he loves to
[29:44] grill meat and eat meat and have these
[29:48] conversations and add that value to the
[29:51] community in his small way and it's no
[29:53] pressure. Maybe something like that. Um,
[29:57] but I I I don't I don't know what I'll
[30:00] do, but I know that I want the
[30:02] flexibility to decide for myself. It's
[30:05] also an amazing I think this actually
[30:08] something that I've never talked about.
[30:09] uh just came to know uh just just
[30:12] thought about it because it's like when
[30:14] you have Bitcoin and you are stacking
[30:18] consistently and your purchasing power
[30:20] and with that your life energy power
[30:23] goes up you all of the sudden have
[30:26] leverage. So in in your example who was
[30:30] like your granddad was it or like my
[30:33] grand my grandfather founded the
[30:35] company. Yeah. Yeah. Oh, your grand your
[30:37] your grandfather um that works now for
[30:40] for the the store um for the the grills.
[30:45] He can at any time say, "Oh, like
[30:47] goodbye." Like I I don't like it anymore
[30:49] or like you treat me badly. I don't want
[30:52] it anymore. Uh it probably doesn't
[30:54] happen because it's like a good
[30:55] environment and stuff like that. But um
[30:58] with Bitcoin and with h having this
[31:01] retirement plan, you can still work, if
[31:05] you enjoy it and you have leverage and
[31:07] feel like, oh, like I really don't want
[31:10] that. So like either this changes or I
[31:13] just go because I can afford to go. And
[31:16] having this exit option, having the the
[31:19] flexibility of saying, "Oh, I don't want
[31:22] that anymore. I just go just as an
[31:26] option. Not even as saying like you have
[31:28] to do it or you you should do it. Uh
[31:31] mostly you you should work something
[31:34] because you probably be depressed after
[31:36] like um a year of laying on the beach.
[31:39] Um so you should do something. So maybe
[31:43] stick with what you're already good at.
[31:45] H but having that option gives you
[31:47] leverage. And we know in business it's
[31:49] all about leverage. Who has the who sits
[31:51] on the highest stick? and you being able
[31:55] and to walk away and saying no is
[31:59] fantastic and Bitcoin gives you that
[32:01] freedom and this opportunity.
[32:04] I I think about that often, Robin. So
[32:08] that's a mentality that you understand
[32:10] implicitly, right? And then I compare
[32:12] that to a lot of my friends in the
[32:15] corporate world who have the mindset of
[32:20] I have to stay in this job. This job
[32:22] pays me really well. In 10 years, this
[32:25] is what I will be earning. This is what
[32:28] my savings will be. This is what my
[32:30] investments will be. I can't I cannot
[32:34] stop
[32:36] my work at this corporate employer
[32:39] because the benefits are so high and I
[32:44] can only realize them by staying where I
[32:47] am,
[32:48] right? And they are delay they they are
[32:52] delaying their optionality
[32:55] because of the indoctrination
[32:59] from school and then b like major
[33:03] business business majoring in business
[33:05] and college. It puts it puts you in
[33:09] the matrix so to speak so that you you
[33:13] are so well conditioned to stay within
[33:16] those bounds that you can't
[33:18] conceptualize
[33:20] leaving to a parallel system that may
[33:23] work better for you. And we have just
[33:26] exited
[33:28] that world and exist in the parallel
[33:31] system.
[33:32] And our lives are proof that it is
[33:36] beneficial to the individual, to the
[33:39] family, to the worker, to the
[33:41] institution, to the company, right? And
[33:45] I think it's a lot of fear that pe that
[33:48] keeps people from making that decision
[33:50] to allocate one to even 5% of their
[33:55] portfolio to Bitcoin because even even
[33:57] that small percentage I think will make
[34:00] such a drastic difference to someone's
[34:03] retirement ability in the next 10 years.
[34:07] And
[34:09] because there's been so much FUD on
[34:12] Bitcoin, I think it's still clouding
[34:14] that decision and all the all of the
[34:19] forces that act on them in their
[34:22] corporate job keep them away from taking
[34:26] the Bitcoin option and exit and only and
[34:31] only ensures that they are forced to
[34:34] stay in a job that they may or may not
[34:36] like for longer. It it has to you have
[34:39] to have you have to do the work to
[34:42] understand Bitcoin and I that takes time
[34:45] and that takes diligence and a
[34:47] tremendous amount of effort, right? But
[34:50] I think Michael Sailor said it best,
[34:53] right? As he tends to you spend 80,000
[34:58] hours of your life working, you should
[35:00] probably spend a 100 hours figuring out
[35:02] how to keep it. and and that that's I
[35:05] think the the shift that needs to happen
[35:08] in in America at you know for the
[35:12] corporate worker but also the people
[35:14] that are struggling to make ends meet.
[35:16] It's for it's for everybody.
[35:19] It's to give that optionality for
[35:21] everyone at whatever scale that they can
[35:24] afford. Yeah. It's it's super
[35:26] interesting when I talk with uh with
[35:30] like friends sometimes and with family
[35:33] members and I told them like you you
[35:35] have to study money and you have to
[35:37] study like where you invest your money.
[35:40] Um because they're not aware that not
[35:43] investing is a choice. So if you they
[35:46] are just putting everything in the euro
[35:47] or in dollar in whatever the fiat
[35:49] currency is, this is an active choice
[35:52] they are willing to do. But they don't
[35:56] realize it's an active choice, right? So
[35:59] when I tell them, oh, you you have to
[36:01] study money, they're like, oh, like
[36:02] what? Like why should I spend my time on
[36:05] on researching my money? I I have the
[36:08] euro. I just like saving in that or I
[36:10] have my ETF. I have my bank bank
[36:12] consultant. And that argument of sale is
[36:14] so amazing because like saying, hey, you
[36:17] have 80,000 hours that you work for
[36:19] money, maybe spend some time, 100 hours.
[36:24] Yeah. how to keep that money that you
[36:26] work for. It's a no-brainer, but people
[36:28] don't see that. People are distracted by
[36:30] news. People are distracted by any sorts
[36:32] of confusion. And it's sad to see.
[36:34] Honestly, it it it is it is especially
[36:39] especially among very intelligent people
[36:42] who have I and I would put myself in
[36:46] this class of people. I I loved
[36:49] economics
[36:52] at an early age. My my dad introduced me
[36:56] to economics and theories of economics
[37:01] as a young child and I thought that I
[37:04] had an advantage with that type of
[37:07] education and then I studied finance in
[37:10] university
[37:12] and thought that I was miles ahead of
[37:14] everybody else with this understanding
[37:16] and knowledge and then I get to Bitcoin
[37:19] and I understand that Keynesian
[37:21] economics is an indoctrination tool to
[37:26] keep this debt monetary system
[37:29] normalized and perpetuated when it
[37:32] doesn't when the natural order of
[37:36] economics is much more aligned with the
[37:39] Austrian school which I had never heard
[37:41] of until Bitcoin.
[37:43] No professor, no teacher, no assignment
[37:47] ever explored the concepts of Austrian
[37:50] economics and
[37:53] I don't think the the education system,
[37:56] the institutional corporate America
[37:59] system or the monetary system based on
[38:02] debt
[38:04] benefits from anyone understanding
[38:06] Austrian economics at all. It foils the
[38:11] entire
[38:12] program that they've set in motion,
[38:15] which I kind of see now busting at the
[38:18] seams.
[38:20] I I I see the the the debt based system
[38:23] busting at the seams at here in the US
[38:26] and globally.
[38:28] I've never seen more
[38:30] news or podcasts or um asset managers
[38:37] uh or VC investors talk about the issue
[38:41] of the looming debt crisis.
[38:45] I only in the past, you know, 12 months
[38:49] have I seen political actors and
[38:52] investors talk about how the debt that
[38:56] we have is unsustainable and something
[39:00] needs to be done. And at the same time,
[39:02] they're mentioning something that's
[39:04] usually never been mentioned. We have
[39:06] Bitcoin rising in the zeitgeist. people
[39:10] talking about Bitcoin, people talking
[39:12] about, you know, the these this new
[39:14] savings technology. And I don't think
[39:16] that's an accident. I think they're
[39:18] trying to they're trying to say to
[39:21] people, "Wow, we have a really big
[39:23] problem and we're not sure of how to fix
[39:24] it." And at the same time, here's this
[39:28] new monetary asset that's had a meteoric
[39:31] rise, and here are all the problems it
[39:33] solves.
[39:35] It's hard for me to I don't think a lot
[39:38] of people link those two or connect
[39:41] those two, but they're absolutely
[39:43] connected.
[39:44] And I think it's only a matter of time
[39:46] before that switch really hits people's
[39:49] brains and they start to understand, oh
[39:52] wow, this this this is all about to
[39:54] change and Bitcoin will take center
[39:56] stage.
[39:58] It it's that that pain of the fiat
[40:02] system getting so big to the point where
[40:06] you cannot no longer
[40:10] ignore it and you will have to find a
[40:13] solution and it's on us Bitcoin Bitcoin
[40:16] educators
[40:18] but even
[40:20] it's on us everyone that has Bitcoin to
[40:23] be that educator
[40:25] to be prepared to have a solution. If
[40:28] someone says in your family like, "Oh,
[40:31] like inflation is eating me away. What
[40:34] can I do? I'm I'm feeling so bad because
[40:37] of my financial situation." You should
[40:40] be the past. You should be the one that
[40:43] says like, "Oh, I adopted Bitcoin
[40:47] because of that and you should study it
[40:50] and learn about it. It might be an
[40:52] interesting solution for you." Mhm. Mhm.
[40:56] Absolutely. More of like an educator,
[40:59] more of like an like here is Bitcoin. If
[41:03] you want to take it, take it and I'm
[41:06] here to to educate yourself because if
[41:09] you if we are if you are on the Titanic
[41:12] and you see that we are going to the
[41:15] iceberg, don't you want to take your
[41:17] family with you? And this is actually
[41:19] something that a lot of people don't
[41:21] know. Um
[41:24] the Titanic, the first
[41:27] uh savings boats, the first boats that
[41:30] save the people we're going empty or
[41:33] half empty because people were skeptical
[41:37] if it's even real. People
[41:40] uh were dancing like it's crazy when you
[41:42] see the reports. People were dancing on
[41:46] deck and were playing music and playing
[41:48] games because they all felt like ah like
[41:51] why should I get off the boat just to
[41:53] get on the boat after they fixed it or
[41:55] like it did not really and it were on
[41:58] the Titanic. I mean the the captain
[42:00] itself said something like not even God
[42:04] himself could sink the ship. Something
[42:06] like there's some famous words around
[42:08] that. Yeah. Yeah. They can God can sink
[42:12] the ship and God will sink the sphere
[42:14] ship and uh the first um boats are
[42:17] leaving. Uh the lifeboats now I get the
[42:21] word lifeboat.
[42:22] Uh the first lifeboats are leaving and
[42:25] you are on it or not. Uh and and you
[42:28] better should be on it than not be on
[42:30] it. I I tell uh my close friend who is
[42:35] also a Bitcoiner because we we have a
[42:38] lot of the same friends and we're trying
[42:41] we've been trying to introduce them
[42:42] softly to Bitcoin as an idea
[42:46] and a lot of them don't get it and are
[42:49] happy with their very good returns the
[42:52] past 2 years in you know the S&P so they
[42:57] don't think that they have a need for it
[42:59] right Um, and we say to each other all
[43:03] the time, like
[43:05] I think that uh
[43:08] I think that
[43:10] I wish we could save more of our
[43:12] friends. You and I are on the lifeboat
[43:17] already with a bottle of rosé, drinking
[43:21] rosé on the lifeboat already saved. And
[43:25] the people on the Titanic are looking at
[43:28] us and saying, "Look at those idiots.
[43:31] They fell off the ship. They fell off
[43:34] the unsinkable ship." But we are on the
[43:38] lifeboat and watching the Titanic, you
[43:41] know, 300 m from the iceberg that they
[43:44] don't know that they're about to hit.
[43:46] And we're trying to get them on the
[43:48] lifeboat so that they can actually see
[43:51] the trajectory of the boat into the
[43:54] iceberg.
[43:56] And you It's crazy. People have to get
[43:58] it. Yeah. You and you can't understand
[44:01] it for them. You and and it takes many
[44:05] many touch points in my experience to
[44:08] get them it takes a calm and cool
[44:11] approach to get them open to the idea
[44:14] and then many many touch points for
[44:17] understanding the idea.
[44:20] And then something has to click in them
[44:22] so that when they get off work,
[44:25] they tune into your podcast. They tune
[44:28] into
[44:30] Michael Sailor's latest speech at a
[44:32] conference or, you know, Jeff Booth or
[44:36] Lyn Alden or, you know, and and James
[44:40] Lavish or Larry Leard, any of these, you
[44:43] know, macro big picture experts or hard
[44:46] money asset uh experts. and actually
[44:50] listen to them without judgment and
[44:53] absorb the information and a willingness
[44:57] to say maybe my world view is incorrect.
[45:00] Am am I willing to have my world view
[45:04] flipped on its head
[45:06] in search of truth and you have to be
[45:09] open to that concept to understand
[45:12] what's happening and how Bitcoin's a
[45:14] solution. The first time I ever made any
[45:16] money, I got myself from that money a
[45:19] watch. And ever since then, I collect
[45:21] time pieces to remember times where I
[45:24] achieved some milestone. That's why I
[45:26] got the Bitcoin 2025 edition when I went
[45:30] to my first ever American Bitcoin
[45:32] conference. So for me, the Bitcoin
[45:34] watches from Coin Villan represents the
[45:37] time that we are living in. For every
[45:39] person that wears a Bitcoin watch, I
[45:42] know they are representing sound money
[45:45] to the outside world. Make sure to check
[45:48] out those amazing coin vigilante time
[45:50] pieces down in the descriptions. I love
[45:53] those watches so so much. I know how big
[45:56] of a hurdle it can be to have
[45:59] self-custody, but it's so freaking
[46:01] important to make that first step. But
[46:03] we have to make sure it's as easy and
[46:06] simple as possible. And that's exactly
[46:09] what Bitbox did. Bitbox created the
[46:12] simplest and the easiest hard wallet to
[46:15] use to get into self custody. So get
[46:18] yourself a Bitbox down from the link in
[46:21] the description. And when you use code
[46:23] Robin, you even get a 5% discount. Most
[46:26] people realize that way, way, way too
[46:30] late. If you have Bitcoin, you have to
[46:32] have a self-custody hardware wallet, but
[46:34] what are you doing if that hardware
[46:36] wallet breaks? Yeah, you wrote your seed
[46:38] phrase on paper. What if that paper is
[46:42] just dissolving or water is spilled on
[46:44] top of it? Paper is very, very
[46:47] nondurable. So, you have to have a fire
[46:50] resistant, water resistant, and impact
[46:52] proof method of securing your seat
[46:55] phrase so you can back up your keys. And
[46:58] to do that, you should use a solid
[47:00] titanium plate from Stamp Seed. Go to
[47:04] stampseed.com
[47:05] and use code Robin to get not five or
[47:09] 10, but 15% off your stamp seed. The
[47:14] most important thing for your Bitcoin
[47:17] journey is not buying Bitcoin, but it's
[47:19] how to keep them. And yes, you have
[47:21] maybe the right tools, but how do you
[47:23] actually go ahead and stick it all
[47:25] together? So, it's the most secure for
[47:28] you personally. Self- custody is a
[47:30] deeply personalized journey. And the
[47:32] Bitcoin way is helping you exactly
[47:35] finding that correct setup for you
[47:38] personally. They're also helping you
[47:40] with securing your own cyber security.
[47:43] And if you want to go one step above all
[47:46] that, you can even get a consultation
[47:49] for a plan B residency. Go to the
[47:52] bitcoinway.com/roin
[47:56] and you will get a 30 minute free
[47:58] consultation. I I want to I want to read
[48:01] something to you. Uh, I think it's super
[48:03] interesting because I just like um
[48:06] double check the thing on CHBD with the
[48:08] the live post because I've I actually
[48:10] heard this from someone and never really
[48:12] verified myself and it's actually true
[48:17] and the three reasons why it happened
[48:21] was lack of urgency. So, uh many
[48:24] passengers as we already discussed did
[48:26] not see
[48:28] that the ship was really in danger. So
[48:30] they did not believe it even though they
[48:31] heard it. Then there was a big
[48:34] uncertainty around the crew. They did
[48:37] not had the the training for that. So
[48:41] the first ship in that size that sang
[48:44] like obviously like you the the
[48:46] procedures the the training was not in
[48:48] place uh back then. And then there was
[48:51] also like a lot of social hierarchy uh
[48:53] where they tried to get uh to the to the
[48:57] first class passengers first but they
[49:00] were not coming and like there were a
[49:02] lot of uh so like I would guess like
[49:05] half of the reason was people didn't
[49:07] took it seriously and half of the reason
[49:09] was just lack of procedure and and
[49:12] getting to people and and weird things
[49:14] like that. And then this resulted in the
[49:17] live boat number seven which was the
[49:19] first one to leave. It had the capacity
[49:22] of 65 people and only 28 people left in
[49:26] this boat. What a shame. What a shame.
[49:30] And 70% of the people on on the boat I
[49:35] heard I have to double check 70% of
[49:37] people died. Of course, if the lifeboats
[49:41] leave half empty, more than half empty,
[49:45] of course, you will have a massive dis
[49:47] disaster. And I think this so the the
[49:51] only way the a Titanic analogy and
[49:55] Bitcoin analogy with Titanics breaks
[49:57] down is I think even the last person
[50:01] leaving the Titanic will benefit from
[50:03] Bitcoin. Yes. So there will be a
[50:05] lifeboat for everyone. Nobody has to
[50:08] drown. Um,
[50:11] but you will you will have a lot of
[50:14] better life if you are getting in the
[50:16] early boats and everyone can get in
[50:18] there. Like even if you have like€2
[50:21] on your bank account like you can get in
[50:24] the those€2 can be on a lightning
[50:26] wallet. Yeah. And it's already better
[50:28] than on your bank account. So
[50:32] I I'm just stunned. And the more I look
[50:35] in this Tatanic comparison, the more I
[50:37] like it.
[50:40] It makes more and more sense for me. But
[50:42] it's it's it's really hard to believe
[50:44] that people don't see it. But then if
[50:46] you make the the the things of the
[50:48] Titanic, you're like, yeah, it's it's
[50:49] it's human psychologies. People feel
[50:53] safe in the present if they're not
[50:55] seeing the danger directly. And
[50:58] inflation is a a danger that they don't
[51:01] directly see, but they will see. Yeah,
[51:04] that's a that's a problem. Yeah. And and
[51:07] I think they they feel they feel it now
[51:10] and they know it's a problem now, but to
[51:13] your point like like the passengers who
[51:16] are uncertain. If I were on if I were on
[51:19] the Titanic, right, and some and someone
[51:22] from the crew or someone said, "Oh, I
[51:24] hear that we just hit something and
[51:26] we're in danger." I wouldn't want to
[51:29] believe it because I like dancing with
[51:33] my girlfriend. I like that we're about
[51:35] to sit down for a nice lobster tail
[51:38] dinner.
[51:40] I'm not in if if I can if I can
[51:44] force myself to believe that not to be
[51:47] true, then I have a great evening ahead
[51:50] of me, right? And then
[51:55] I I don't want that disrupted, right?
[51:59] And but the truth is and reality is no,
[52:02] you need to act right now.
[52:05] And
[52:07] just a small action in this case, it's
[52:09] not life or death at this point, right?
[52:13] Just a small action will have outsized
[52:17] benefit to you in the future. you know
[52:20] on the Titanic that that action means
[52:22] life or death
[52:25] but here you know just opening your mind
[52:28] to it and then slowly entering into
[52:30] Bitcoin will still have tremendous
[52:33] benefit to to someone who does that but
[52:36] I understand and this is what I
[52:38] encounter when talking to a lot of my
[52:40] friends is well my job is great I can
[52:45] feed my family I have a house and the
[52:48] mortgage rate is 2.5%.
[52:52] I I I don't need Bitcoin
[52:55] despite understanding the inflation
[52:57] problems. I don't need Bitcoin. And it's
[53:01] a it's hard to get them over that
[53:04] because, you know, Bitcoin's available
[53:07] to anyone who recognizes that they need
[53:09] it. If you don't recognize that you need
[53:12] it, it's a speculative asset still. It's
[53:16] it's on it's not on sure footing. it's
[53:18] volatile, you know, I I'm I'm not
[53:21] looking for that, right? So, it it's
[53:26] it's it's hard to get them to just take
[53:29] a step out of their their normal life,
[53:31] which is going rather well, and say,
[53:34] "Well, you know, you do need this
[53:36] thing." And and and I get that. So, the
[53:39] status quo and the their current state
[53:43] of things is fine enough. So, to them,
[53:46] they don't need it. and they don't put
[53:48] in the work. Um, and I try I try over
[53:54] time and sometimes it takes a year,
[53:56] sometimes more uh to to get them to, you
[54:00] know, allocate maybe just a little bit
[54:02] or, you know, some of my friends still
[54:04] none at all, and I've been talking to
[54:05] them about it for 3 years. And that's a
[54:09] shame uh to me. Uh, but I can't force
[54:13] them to click the buttons. So um and
[54:16] even if you force them, it will not
[54:18] change anything because they will sell
[54:20] in the first crash. So it's it's like
[54:23] they they will jump off the lifeboat,
[54:26] swim back to the Titanic and sink with
[54:28] the Titanic. That that that's what if if
[54:30] you don't understand Bitcoin, you will
[54:32] do exactly that. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[54:34] Exactly. And it's uh and it's and it's
[54:38] not it doesn't come from a bad place in
[54:41] in a way. It comes from a faith in the
[54:44] existing system, right? People have
[54:46] faith in the existing system and they
[54:48] don't
[54:50] like to them America is the best. It'll
[54:53] it has been the best. It is the best and
[54:55] it will always be the best because
[54:57] Americans always find a way. And I like
[55:01] to believe that. I do. However, it's I I
[55:07] because I now know way more than I did 3
[55:10] years ago about the financial system,
[55:13] about the Fed, about money printing and
[55:16] central banking.
[55:18] I know I feel much more confident
[55:22] in my knowledge about the mechanisms of
[55:26] this financial machine.
[55:28] And I and and after, you know, after the
[55:32] veil has been lifted and I can finally
[55:34] see what's going on,
[55:37] there's no other option for me. And
[55:40] that's only on the other side of a
[55:41] tremendous amount of work and
[55:44] understanding what money is, how it's
[55:47] operated in history,
[55:50] how central banking is is terrible for,
[55:53] you know, the vast majority of the
[55:56] population.
[55:59] Can you understand Bitcoin's value
[56:02] proposition?
[56:03] Right? And uh that just that just takes
[56:07] a tremendous amount of work. And if you
[56:08] don't have the time to do that work, you
[56:11] you it's very difficult to get there.
[56:14] You basically have to believe someone
[56:16] else telling you.
[56:18] It's it's really interesting. And also
[56:20] uh I've just looked it up since last
[56:22] time we spoke Bitcoin went up more than
[56:24] 50% which is a great one-year
[56:27] performance I would say. Um how how much
[56:31] has changed since last year since last
[56:34] time we spoken? How can you how how do
[56:37] you kind of see the the change that we
[56:39] have gone through with the institutional
[56:41] adoption with the ETFs with the
[56:43] strategic Bitcoin reserve with the
[56:45] president presidential things with like
[56:47] Las Vegas happening all all those things
[56:50] I think that we're we are in we are in a
[56:53] sort of acceleration phase
[56:58] of this asset
[57:01] um I like I like a lot of sailor analogy
[57:06] ies uh they make sense to me. He had a
[57:09] presentation talking about um Bitcoin as
[57:12] a network and he
[57:16] he said Bitcoin is not a metafathian
[57:20] network like a social network. Facebook,
[57:23] Instagram are metafian networks where
[57:27] the strength of the network I think is
[57:28] the square of the number of users.
[57:32] So, you know, with these social
[57:34] networks, you know, when you get a 100
[57:37] million users, that's a very powerful
[57:39] network and probably means that it's on
[57:42] pace for a billion people in that
[57:45] network.
[57:46] Uh, Bitcoin is not a metafian network.
[57:49] It does not get stronger with the by the
[57:54] just the pure amount of people adopting
[57:57] the network. It gets stronger with the
[58:00] amount of capital entering the network.
[58:04] More more like a uh Newtonian network
[58:07] like a planet or a black hole, right? If
[58:12] if an if an asteroid passes by Earth,
[58:16] you know, we wave to it and say, you
[58:19] know, have fun on your journey through
[58:21] space, but it's not going to affect our
[58:24] gravity. It's not going to affect the
[58:27] the tides. It's not going to affect, you
[58:30] know, our life on this planet very much.
[58:33] But if a black hole shows up, you know,
[58:37] a thousand miles away, it's going to
[58:40] suck off the atmosphere of the planet
[58:43] and rip the Earth into it, right? you
[58:48] know, a black hole is not the same as an
[58:51] asteroid the same size,
[58:54] right? It it's a different thing. And
[58:58] and I see institutions understanding
[59:02] that and that's why they've been
[59:06] the class that has been the benefits of
[59:09] accumulation the last year since we last
[59:12] talked. you know, sovereign wealth
[59:15] funds, uh,
[59:18] US institutions, the ETFs,
[59:21] strategy as a treasury company opening
[59:24] the door and giving the playbook for a
[59:27] Bitcoin strategy.
[59:30] And I think they were very fringe a year
[59:35] ago even though they started doing this
[59:37] in 2020. But I think as of today there's
[59:40] 150 to 200 companies that have adopted a
[59:43] Bitcoin strategy. And I wouldn't be
[59:45] surprised if you know by the end of 2026
[59:49] that number is over a thousand, right?
[59:52] because there's 50,000 companies that
[59:56] are big enough that you know can't grow
[60:00] their mature business more than you know
[60:03] 3 to 5% a year and they benefit greatly
[60:08] from a Bitcoin treasury st strategy
[60:11] because they have access to capital
[60:13] markets that can help them raise money
[60:15] to invest in it and and secure the life
[60:19] of that business for another 300 years
[60:22] without tremendous innovation to their
[60:24] core business.
[60:26] Like Strat Strategy has enough money to
[60:29] keep their software business going for
[60:33] eternity theoretically,
[60:35] but they don't have to reinvent the
[60:37] software or offer new subscriptions or
[60:41] raise the rate of the subscription to
[60:44] the software because they're backed, you
[60:47] know, some ungodly amount of Bitcoin
[60:50] over overcolaterized to their business
[60:52] and their other obligations,
[60:55] right? And that can only happen when the
[60:58] collateral of the business and the the
[61:00] the primary asset of the business
[61:04] is is money that is in finite supply. It
[61:07] it's it's a it's a it's I think this is
[61:11] such a big concept that I think it's
[61:13] going to change you know how money is
[61:16] invested like how VCs determine what
[61:19] businesses they invest in. You know, if
[61:22] a V if a venture capital firm raises a
[61:24] billion dollars and they can get 50% a
[61:27] year on Bitcoin or invest in a startup
[61:30] trying to do some very noble thing, but
[61:35] it's risky. You know, they may not
[61:38] choose to do that. They can have a
[61:42] Bitcoin preference as the hurdle rate
[61:45] that may diminish a lot of the
[61:48] speculative venture capital investing or
[61:51] private equity investing that has been
[61:54] you know so dominating our financial
[61:57] system for the past you know 20 plus
[61:59] yearsish. Uh it's it's a uh the the
[62:03] treasuries I f the treasury companies I
[62:05] find extremely interesting because those
[62:08] very smart financial engineers I think
[62:11] it's starting to click with them and
[62:14] it's evidenced by you know multiple
[62:17] companies daily coming out with some
[62:20] sort of Bitcoin strategy.
[62:23] um not not just the political news, not
[62:26] just the legislative and law news that's
[62:29] coming um around the world and in the
[62:32] US. Um I think I think the smart the
[62:36] smart money has figured out what it is.
[62:40] I love the po I love the point of
[62:41] venture capital. Sorry to jump in here
[62:43] because it's like a successful startup
[62:46] in my opinion will definitely outgrow
[62:49] Bitcoin.
[62:50] But nine out of 10 startups will go to
[62:53] zero.
[62:55] So that one startup has to outperform so
[62:59] massively
[63:01] to also make up for the loss you've done
[63:05] on the nine other startups in Bitcoin.
[63:09] All on fear terms, that's easy. Like one
[63:13] startup, that one home run will give you
[63:16] so much money that you more than welcome
[63:20] to spend it. But when you have Bitcoin
[63:22] on the other hand, and you're like,
[63:23] "Okay, I could also have invested all
[63:26] that $500 million, let's say, into
[63:29] Bitcoin instead of this into this each
[63:32] like uh I don't know, like 20 million,
[63:35] 30 million, 100 million into those
[63:37] stocks." Then you're like okay would
[63:40] have still outperformed that one startup
[63:43] to outperform not only Bitcoin but then
[63:46] also outperform the loss that you have
[63:48] done from all the other startups that
[63:50] that have failed has to grow so
[63:52] substantially it has to be such a great
[63:55] idea that it's really hard to outgrow
[63:57] Bitcoin. So I think the one thing that
[64:00] will change is people will only invest
[64:03] in proven ideas
[64:06] and in ideas that are so good that you
[64:10] have to pursue it anyways
[64:13] they are so good you really want to try
[64:15] it out even if you say like oh it has a
[64:18] high likelihood of failing. So either
[64:20] people starting something that has a
[64:22] high likelihood of succeeding
[64:26] or they start something that has a low
[64:29] likelihood of succeeding but it's such
[64:32] an amazing idea that you still want to
[64:35] pursue it. And I think that's where uh
[64:37] venture capital should be already uh not
[64:41] like the thing that we have now like
[64:43] let's give everyone some some capital
[64:44] and let's see what which which founder
[64:47] will make the most of it. Yeah, there
[64:49] will come a lot of changes. I love that
[64:51] point and I think the the basis of that
[64:54] entire business model is basically very
[64:59] very cheap or free money in most cases,
[65:03] right? So these VC firms can
[65:08] uh that their their business model is
[65:12] essentially based on taking money they
[65:15] can get from a bank for for nothing and
[65:19] then splattering it wherever they can to
[65:23] hope for one moonshot.
[65:25] and and and that ability for them to do
[65:28] that is only because of a debt-based
[65:32] monetary system. So these banks are
[65:34] incentivized to create money out of thin
[65:37] air for crazy ideas and if they fail
[65:42] they fail no problem. Uh but if they
[65:45] succeed, they usually succeed at scale
[65:49] in disrupting some industry which
[65:52] eventually takes away you know some
[65:54] number of human beings real jobs in the
[65:57] real world. I I I kind of view that as
[66:00] some sort of you know like financial
[66:02] terrorism in a way. You know, you can
[66:05] borrow, you can have this bank create
[66:07] money for you for basically free. And
[66:10] what you're doing with it, like think of
[66:13] private equity, borrow money at half a
[66:16] percent.
[66:17] Buy a business with it.
[66:20] their their
[66:22] standard procedure is to take, you know,
[66:25] the MBA approach to cut as many costs as
[66:29] possible, fire and lay off as many
[66:32] people as possible, fatten the margins,
[66:36] and then sell it 5 years later for more
[66:38] money. So you so that that that company
[66:42] in this existing system can borrow money
[66:45] for free, take away real jobs in the
[66:49] real world with money that cost them
[66:52] nothing to obtain and then sell that
[66:55] business for more later. So
[66:58] there's there's no there's no cost to,
[67:02] you know, real destruction
[67:05] in that business for that private equity
[67:08] firm. and they're actually incentivized
[67:10] to as borrow as much money as possible
[67:13] to buy as many businesses as possible to
[67:16] fire as many people as possible and then
[67:20] sell it. So I think once once we go to a
[67:24] hard money standard
[67:27] that stops
[67:29] or or and we're going to see a big
[67:31] decline in it and I think we're actually
[67:32] seeing a big decline in it now. private
[67:35] equity, I think, is in is in some
[67:38] trouble uh with rates as high as they
[67:40] are. And I I like that because that that
[67:43] that interest rate is basically the cost
[67:47] of financial terrorism
[67:51] and it's ma Max Kaiser talks about that
[67:55] a lot and I never heard it framed in
[67:57] that way. Um, but it does make a lot of
[68:01] sense and that's why you see our
[68:03] manufacturing base completely dwindled
[68:06] and the evaporation of the middle class,
[68:10] not just in the US but most places in
[68:13] the world. You're either extremely
[68:15] wealthy or you have nothing with very
[68:18] little in between. And that's this this
[68:21] constant
[68:22] debt-based system that people
[68:26] have enjoyed for quite some time. I love
[68:28] that. I mean, I don't love that, but I
[68:31] love your perspective on that. Just to
[68:33] make sure. Yeah. And it's it's it's the
[68:37] the time flies with you all the time. Uh
[68:39] I have I have one question to ask each
[68:41] and every one of my guests, especially
[68:42] returning guests. Um what have you
[68:46] learned since you have last been on the
[68:48] podcast outside of Bitcoin? Oo, that's a
[68:51] very good question. That's why it's one
[68:53] of my favorites. Yeah, very good. Very
[68:56] good. I I've I've
[68:59] it's it's related to Bitcoin, but I I've
[69:02] learned a lot about uh central bank
[69:05] monetary systems throughout history.
[69:09] That's been kind of one of my uh biggest
[69:14] uh deep dives since we've last spoken. I
[69:17] read the creature creature from Jackal
[69:20] Island which is like a 600 something
[69:24] page book on the creation of the Federal
[69:27] Reserve and started exploring you know
[69:31] the results of central bank policy
[69:34] throughout history and I'd never
[69:39] I'd never really questioned that until
[69:41] getting into Bitcoin but learning that
[69:44] history I think made me a very
[69:49] uh ardent and bigger supporter of
[69:53] Bitcoin, but just made me more
[69:56] knowledgeable about how you know the
[69:58] systems around the world work and
[70:00] operate. And I think that gave me a uh a
[70:06] lot of insight around uh
[70:11] how much work is done in every country
[70:16] to keep that system going from from ever
[70:21] ever since you're educated as a young
[70:24] child. You you hear about a 2% inflation
[70:27] rate being great, right? And you just
[70:31] and then naturally you get older and
[70:34] those things that you hear as a young
[70:36] child just become part of your normal
[70:39] operating system as a human being. You
[70:41] don't even question.
[70:44] And
[70:46] it's worth it was definitely worth
[70:48] revisiting for me because I thought I
[70:51] knew
[70:52] uh everything about it and I thought
[70:54] that it was good.
[70:57] uh however after revisiting it I
[71:01] absolutely see how this is a recipe for
[71:05] disaster and it has been a recipe for
[71:07] disaster every time in history.
[71:11] So just just learning learning more
[71:14] about financial markets outside of
[71:17] Bitcoin I think has has been like what I
[71:21] what I've learned the most about. I feel
[71:23] like historians have an unfair advantage
[71:26] in understanding Bitcoin, but they
[71:29] don't. I I know some some people that
[71:31] really love history and they still don't
[71:33] get Bitcoin, but they are more open to
[71:35] it, you know, like if if you meet
[71:36] someone that is really into history,
[71:39] that is like watching a lot of
[71:41] documentaries, like really uh looking in
[71:44] all the aspects of history in many
[71:46] different areas, and they're just like
[71:48] trying to soak everything up in many
[71:50] different directions. If you tell them
[71:52] about Bitcoin, they're way more open to
[71:54] that. And it's fascinating for me to see
[71:58] uh this connection between
[72:00] intelligent people that just started the
[72:03] past and really can grasp way better in
[72:07] uh in in way quicker in like what is
[72:10] currently going on and what will go on
[72:12] in the future. So, it's something that I
[72:14] lack a lot uh history knowledge. It's
[72:16] it's something that I've now started
[72:18] doing a lot. um looking at all the
[72:22] historical things and uh learning from
[72:25] that now because in school I hated
[72:29] history. I was like why am I studying
[72:32] the past like what the heck is going on?
[72:35] I don't want to live in the past. But
[72:37] it's um it was a very stupid opinion of
[72:40] mine. I've reversed it now and I'm
[72:44] trying to to learn now more from
[72:46] history. because I think history is an
[72:47] amazing thing to to learn from. So,
[72:50] thank you so much for bringing the point
[72:51] because I think a lot of people uh maybe
[72:53] especially younger people this podcast
[72:56] has not that many more that many young
[72:59] uh people in the audience like under 18
[73:02] I think like have 0.1% of the audience.
[73:05] Um but also like 25 if you're that old
[73:08] like you're also young. Um but that's
[73:10] that's that's really cool uh to to have
[73:13] that to have that. Um, as you know, um,
[73:16] we have an end routine in the podcast
[73:18] where the previous guest is asking a
[73:20] question, um, for the next guest without
[73:22] knowing who the next guest actually is.
[73:24] And it's the first question where I'm
[73:26] quite sure that you don't know the
[73:29] answer of. Okay. Even even if I never
[73:33] gave you that gave you that question,
[73:35] it's it's something that I was not aware
[73:37] of. Like I was aware of it, but I
[73:39] couldn't really uh explain the
[73:41] difference between those. Um, you really
[73:43] have to be nerding out with treasury
[73:45] companies, but maybe you maybe you do
[73:47] nerd out with treasury companies. We'll
[73:49] see. Um, we'll see. Now, uh, what
[73:53] preferred stock would you purchase of
[73:55] Micro Strategy,
[73:57] Strike, Strife, or Stride?
[74:01] Okay,
[74:03] I then I have been nerding out. So, I I
[74:07] I would purchase
[74:09] uh Strife, STRF. I like where it is in
[74:15] the capital stack for Micro Strategy,
[74:20] and I like the 10%
[74:25] uh per random uh dividend payment or
[74:29] coupon payment. I think it's a debt
[74:30] instrument, so I guess it would be a
[74:31] coupon payment. Uh I I I asked uh maybe
[74:36] for the few people that have no clue
[74:37] about what strike strive and stride is
[74:41] uh preferred stocks of of of micro
[74:43] strategy or strategy B now. Um I asked
[74:46] Chibbit to explain it to me like I'm 5
[74:50] years old and uh you you will tell me if
[74:54] if this is too simple or if it's maybe
[74:56] wrong. Yeah. Um, imagine Micro Strategy
[74:59] has three kinds of special piggy banks.
[75:03] Strike pays you candy every 3 months and
[75:06] might turn into golden ticket later.
[75:09] Convert to a normal stock. Strive pays
[75:12] you more candy and if they miss a turn,
[75:15] they will give you even more next time.
[75:18] Stride pays you pays the most candy, but
[75:21] if they miss a turn, too bad, no extra
[75:24] later. uh and that that for strike from
[75:29] those three is the safest and stride is
[75:31] the riskiest. Is that a is that a is
[75:34] that a fair assumption?
[75:36] I think so. I I do not claim to be an
[75:39] expert on these instruments. I've been
[75:42] learning a lot about them the past
[75:44] month. Um
[75:47] I I think the the candy analogy does
[75:50] hold. So, Strife, Strife is a
[75:57] pure dividend payment. So, you're going
[76:00] to get your candy and if they miss, they
[76:03] owe you more candy. So, they're going to
[76:05] if they miss, I think the dividend goes
[76:07] up a percent, I think, something like
[76:10] that. But it increases if they miss a
[76:12] payment. uh and strike yes they pay you
[76:16] 8%
[76:18] uh I think in quarter uh 8% peranom in
[76:21] quarterly dividends
[76:23] and if the price of micro strategy stock
[76:28] goes I think
[76:31] above above some strike price then you
[76:34] can convert those strike shares into
[76:37] common stock in micro strategy uh at
[76:41] some split I
[76:43] And then Stride, which I have the least
[76:45] knowledge of. I think they just
[76:47] announced that a few days ago,
[76:50] um, STRD is is what I'm least familiar
[76:54] with, but I think it's it's just some
[76:57] some other instrument that allows them.
[77:00] I view I view Micro Strategy as building
[77:04] an engine.
[77:06] And with with each one of these
[77:08] products, they're adding another gear
[77:11] into the engine that makes the entire
[77:15] engine turn and produce more energy.
[77:18] Someone out there is probably going to
[77:19] disagree and that's totally fine. uh and
[77:23] but but I I like Sailor's analogy of you
[77:26] know using Bitcoin as capital as an
[77:30] input and creating a bunch of torque
[77:34] with these instruments. Uh I don't
[77:38] understand
[77:39] them all enough. I haven't invested in
[77:42] any of them. The one that I liked most
[77:46] that's most conservative is STRF because
[77:50] it pays a very high dividend. So if if
[77:54] you're if you're thinking about like a
[77:56] 6040 portfolio where 40% is bonds and
[78:01] maybe maybe the person you're talking to
[78:03] is 80 years old and they don't want the
[78:06] exposure into a volatile asset, then
[78:11] STRF
[78:13] could be a great addition to a
[78:16] portfolio. Maybe you sell 10% of your
[78:19] bonds and put it into Strife
[78:23] at 10% dividends. That that changes your
[78:28] income profile on that part of your
[78:31] portfolio much higher without a lot of
[78:34] the risk and volatility of the
[78:37] underlying Bitcoin exposure. So, I I
[78:41] think about that for, you know,
[78:43] potential like fixed income investors or
[78:45] older people in retail that are they're
[78:49] losing their shirt holding 40% bonds at
[78:54] 4.5%.
[78:57] Maybe you don't want the risk of, you
[78:59] know, Verizon or AT&T as a dividend
[79:03] stock that's an income prodducing stock
[79:06] ownership vehicle. This could be a very
[79:09] good, you know, asset allocation to
[79:13] boost the income while lowering the
[79:17] volatility of your portfolio. Um, and
[79:20] and giving you more Bitcoin
[79:23] exposure by proxy.
[79:26] Uh, so I I've been thinking about that a
[79:29] a lot recently actually. Um, and I could
[79:32] see myself, you know, as a bare market
[79:36] strategy potentially, you know,
[79:40] maybe maybe I if Bitcoin goes to, you
[79:43] know, a million dollars, maybe I sell
[79:46] 10% of my Bitcoin position and put it
[79:49] into Strife and that pays me income so
[79:54] that I never have to sell any more than
[79:57] 10% of my my Bitcoin exposure.
[80:01] So adding, you know, a bucket for income
[80:04] based on Bitcoin as collateral,
[80:07] I'm kind of weighing like, will this
[80:09] allow me to,
[80:12] you know, hodddle easier with my my the
[80:16] rest of my stack because I can produce
[80:19] income cuz B bit Bitcoin in cold storage
[80:21] just sits there and if you have Bitcoin
[80:23] and even if you have, you know, 10 like
[80:26] a thousand Bitcoin, it's not earning you
[80:28] any income. So you're like you could
[80:31] work a let's say someone you know some
[80:34] garbage man bought Bitcoin in 2013 has a
[80:37] thousand coins you know if that's in
[80:40] cold storage
[80:42] he still has to work his like garbage
[80:45] man job to pay his monthly bills um
[80:49] because he doesn't want to sell any of
[80:50] his Bitcoin or it's not earning him any
[80:52] any money. this these vehicles could
[80:56] provide a way to earn, you know, a few
[80:59] thousand dollar a quarter or a month uh
[81:03] to kind of sustain a lifestyle or
[81:06] benefit from his Bitcoin stack uh so
[81:09] that he doesn't have to sell any in or
[81:11] any more in his cold storage. So, I I
[81:15] think about that and I don't know what
[81:16] the right thing or right call is there.
[81:20] Um, and I haven't made that decision for
[81:22] myself, but that's a very interesting
[81:23] question and I do think about that a
[81:25] lot. I love that. Amazing. I I hit the
[81:28] right guest with that question. I guess
[81:30] you did. You did. I was not sure. I was
[81:31] like, I'm going through that right now,
[81:33] Robin. That's funny. It's funny you
[81:34] asked. Yeah, because it's like I think a
[81:37] lot of people don't. Of course, most
[81:40] people in Bitcoin know what Mike's
[81:41] strategy is, but you have to really dig
[81:43] deep in in understanding the strive
[81:46] strike and and uh strive strike and what
[81:49] was the other one? Stride. Stride.
[81:51] Stride. Yeah. Stride. Yeah. So close
[81:52] together. They are like really hard to
[81:54] distinguish in my brain. I I don't have
[81:57] that big of a brain as Michael Sailor
[81:58] has. So I don't think anybody does.
[82:01] Anything. You want to know You want to
[82:03] know an interesting point about those
[82:04] products? Yeah. Michael Sailor says that
[82:07] he queried AI to develop those products.
[82:12] Well yeah he he mentioned it on his
[82:14] recent talk in Vegas also where he's
[82:16] before he goes to any lawyer or anything
[82:20] he goes ahead and asks uh AI in deep
[82:25] think mode in deep research mode in
[82:27] however it's called in with your
[82:29] preferred AI uh and really goes there
[82:33] puts all the concept all the situations
[82:34] in there and then asks a bunch of
[82:37] questions comes up with a perfect
[82:39] solution and then just goes to the
[82:41] lawyers and say
[82:42] do me this in the next three days. Yeah.
[82:46] And and don't take longer than that
[82:49] otherwise it will goes onto someone
[82:50] else. Something like that. He said it
[82:52] was really fun to to see that even a guy
[82:56] with thousands of lawyers he goes to
[82:58] Chipd first which is amazing to see.
[83:01] Yeah. And and think about those
[83:03] products. I imagine all of those
[83:06] products are now, you know, trading
[83:08] with, you know, multi-billions.
[83:11] So, let's say between them all, let's
[83:13] say there's 10 billion in in capital in
[83:17] all three of those right now. I don't
[83:19] know what it is, but it's definitely in
[83:20] the billions. Artificial intelligence
[83:24] invented a financial instrument that now
[83:27] holds $10 billion and it's functioning.
[83:32] It's a big it's a it's a productivity
[83:34] gain that I don't think human beings
[83:38] have conceptualized yet. And from from
[83:42] conception from query in Michael
[83:45] Sailor's brain to e to solving in AI to
[83:50] it being created and now here was you
[83:53] know a matter of months right and most
[83:57] of that was really the lawyers
[83:59] organizing an execution plan for sailor.
[84:03] So this is this is just a it's just a
[84:06] very interesting time to be alive when
[84:09] you know an AI can come up with some
[84:12] instrument that 3 months later has $3
[84:15] billion
[84:17] or what whatever it is. It it's a it's a
[84:20] very
[84:23] the turn the turnaround from idea to
[84:26] execution has just been shortened by
[84:28] years. It's amazing to see. Yeah, it's
[84:31] amazing. Yeah, it's very cool having to
[84:33] be alive, man. Thank you so much, Will.
[84:36] Uh, it was an awesome talk. I loved our
[84:38] conversations a lot. I hope the people
[84:40] also enjoyed it. Um, before I let you
[84:42] go, where can people find you? People
[84:44] can find me uh on X at BTC for Dummies.
[84:49] Uh, they can find me. They find me
[84:52] there. That's probably the best place to
[84:54] find me. Um, I've been, you know, I've
[84:57] been
[84:58] I was diligent with, you know, preaching
[85:01] on X and adding value on X. And then I
[85:06] kind of I was sitting on the beach one
[85:08] day and I said to myself, you know, I I
[85:13] trying on the internet to to preach
[85:15] Bitcoin is difficult and may not be the
[85:18] best use of my time. And it was creating
[85:20] so much uh anxiety for me to constantly
[85:24] produce content and and do all this and
[85:28] preach the the gospel of Bitcoin. And I
[85:31] said to myself, you know,
[85:35] I don't need to be doing this. I I know
[85:38] that everything points in this direction
[85:41] and nothing stops this train.
[85:43] I'm gonna get off of, you know, Bitcoin
[85:46] Twitter and just live my life and touch
[85:49] grass. And a lot of the last year, I
[85:53] mean, especially the last 6 months, it's
[85:55] been mostly that for me. And I've just
[85:57] been so happy uh about it. But feel free
[86:02] to come in my DMs on BTC for Dummies.
[86:05] I'm happy to chat with anybody uh to
[86:08] talk Bitcoin. Um, and I'm mostly focused
[86:12] on, you know, orange pilling my friends
[86:15] in real life now. Awesome. Thank you so
[86:19] much for your time, Will. And also,
[86:20] thank you so much for everyone that is
[86:21] watching and listening, for joining us
[86:23] today. As always, I'll be back tomorrow
[86:25] with another episode. Bye-bye.
