## Part 2: The 13 Strategic Ideas

### IDEA 1: Legal Verdict & Settlement Intelligence Pipeline
**Portfolio Pattern:** 204-Transcripts-to-Intelligence

**Concept:** Automated pipeline that monitors and extracts intelligence from:
- YouTube legal news (CourtTV, Law&Crime, attorney vlogs)
- Legal podcasts
- Class action databases
- News RSS feeds

**Data Flow:**
```
Sources → Transcription → LLM Analysis → Supabase → Daily Digest Email
```

**Extracted Intelligence:**
- Settlement amounts by practice area + jurisdiction
- Winning legal arguments mentioned
- Emerging case types (new mass torts)
- Attorney/firm names in headlines

**Implementation:**
1. Reuse your 5-module pipeline architecture
2. Add sources: ClassAction.org scraper, legal YouTube channels
3. Store in Supabase with `settlements`, `verdicts`, `practice_areas` tables
4. Daily Resend email to Walker team

**Value:** Know where money is flowing in legal BEFORE competitors. "PI settlements up 40% in Houston" = shift ad spend.

---

### IDEA 2: Multi-LLM Ad Copy Consensus Engine
**Portfolio Pattern:** 006-AI Stock Analyzer (4-model consensus)

**Concept:** Generate legal ad copy using 4 LLMs independently, then arbitrate.

**Workflow:**
```
Input (practice area, USP, demographic)
    ↓
┌─────────┬─────────┬─────────┬─────────┐
│ Claude  │   GPT   │  Grok   │ Gemini  │
│ 3 ads   │ 3 ads   │ 3 ads   │ 3 ads   │
└────┬────┴────┬────┴────┬────┴────┬────┘
     └─────────┴─────────┴─────────┘
                    ↓
            Claude Arbitrator
         (scores: compliance, emotion,
          clarity, CTA strength)
                    ↓
           Top 3 + A/B suggestions
```

**Scoring Criteria:**
- State bar compliance (no guarantees, proper disclaimers)
- Emotional resonance
- Clarity of value proposition
- Call-to-action strength
- Character limits for platform

**Implementation:**
1. Reuse your shared-core LLM client (already supports all 4 providers)
2. Create prompt templates per practice area
3. Arbitration prompt with rubric
4. Output to Google Sheets for review

**Value:** Eliminates single-model bias. 12 variations per request. Faster creative testing.

### IDEA 3: Legal Marketing "Oversold Market" Screener
**Portfolio Pattern:** 010-Oversold Screener

**Concept:** Score geographic markets + practice areas like you score oversold stocks. Find undervalued advertising opportunities.

    settlement_size_score * 0.20 +  # Higher settlements = higher score
    cpl_trend_score * 0.20 +        # Declining CPL = higher score
    case_volume_score * 0.15 +      # Growing filings = higher score
    demographic_score * 0.10 +      # Target demo density
    competitor_spend_score * 0.10   # Lower spend = opportunity
)
```

**Data Sources:**
- Google Trends (search volume by geo)
- SpyFu/SEMrush (competitor spend, CPL estimates)
- CourtListener/PACER (case filing trends)
- Census data (demographics)
- NHTSA/OSHA/CFPB (incident data by location)

**Output:**
